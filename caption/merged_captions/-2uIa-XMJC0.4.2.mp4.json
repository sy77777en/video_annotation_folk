  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a woman with light skin and a prosthetic left leg standing on a skateboard on the ledge of a tall building. She is dressed entirely in white, wearing a tank top, pants, and a beanie. Initially, the camera is positioned at her level, capturing her from the side as she stands centered in the frame, with the building's windows forming the backdrop. The windows reflect the futuristic urban landscape, featuring modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades, situating the scene in the foreground while the urban landscape occupies the background. The weather is partly cloudy. The woman is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows, and is making a slight forward movement. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a lower angle, now positioned below the subject. This change in perspective emphasizes her elevated position on the ledge. The camera steadily moves forward, left, and downward, slightly tilting up and panning right to keep the skateboarder in frame, with some slight shaking. Throughout the video, the woman remains in the center of the frame, maintaining a steady stance on the skateboard. The camera movement from her level to below her enhances the sense of height and scale, underscoring her position against the expansive cityscape reflected in the windows behind her. The entire cityscape is beautifully mirrored in the glass facades, with sleek and contemporary architecture and tall buildings dominating the skyline. The aerial-level camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the scene's dynamics and the woman's confident posture as she faces forward.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera that starts at a level angle and transitions to a low angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera steadily moves forward, left, and downward, slightly tilting up and panning right to keep a skateboarder in frame, with some slight shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with light skin and a prosthetic left leg standing on a skateboard. She is dressed entirely in white, wearing a tank top, pants, and a beanie. Her reflection is visible in the window pane directly behind her.",
    "Motion": "A woman is standing on a skateboard, positioned on the ledge of a tall building. She is wearing a white tank top, light-colored pants, and a knitted cap, highlighting her focus on safety and style. Notably, she has a prosthetic right leg. She is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows, and is making a slight forward movement. The background shows a cityscape with various buildings and a clear sky, indicating a high altitude. The woman faces forward, with a confident posture.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a futuristic urban landscape during daylight. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades. The entire cityscape is beautifully mirrored in the glass facades. The architecture is sleek and contemporary, with tall buildings dominating the skyline. The weather is partly cloudy. ",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
