  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a waterside landscape at dusk. A dark, silhouetted shoreline occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a long, illuminated suspension bridge stretches horizontally across the scene, with its main support tower positioned on the right. A body of water extends from the foreground to the background beneath the bridge, displaying reflections from the bridge lights and from buildings situated on the left. The sky occupies the background in the upper portion of the frame, where a small cloud can be seen drifting from left to right on the left. The camera is positioned at a level angle from a considerable distance, looking out from the foreground shoreline. This is a static, time-lapse video shot from a level angle above the water. The camera remains completely still, employing a deep focus that keeps the entire scene, from the foreground shore to the distant bridge, sharp and clear. While the camera remains completely still, the scene subtly evolves with the gradual darkening of the sky and the gentle movement of the clouds, adding a dynamic touch to the tranquil setting. At dusk, a long suspension bridge with two prominent, red, lattice-style towers spans a wide, calm body of water. The scene is viewed from a dark, wet shoreline in the foreground, where pools of water mirror the surrounding lights. A continuous line of bright lights illuminates the bridge's deck, and their reflections, along with those from buildings on the near shore, shimmer on the water's surface. The sky transitions from a faint orange glow at the horizon to a deep, dark blue above. In the timelapse, clouds can be seen changing positions against the sky on the left.",

    "Subject": "This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a massive, illuminated suspension bridge spanning a wide body of water at dusk. The bridge's long deck is lined with evenly spaced lights, and its towering support structures are also lit, all casting a warm, golden reflection on the calm surface of the water below. In the foreground, the dark, wet silhouette of a rocky or muddy shoreline is visible, while the sky above fades from a deep, dusky orange and blue near the horizon to complete darkness. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the static, wide composition is intended to capture the serene atmosphere and the grand scale of the architectural marvel against the twilight sky. The focus is on the peaceful interplay between the man-made lights and the natural environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
