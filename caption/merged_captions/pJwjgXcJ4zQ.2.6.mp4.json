  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a narrow city street in a Japanese city, capturing a vibrant cityscape with a lively street scene. The street itself occupies the lower half of the frame, leading from the foreground into the background, lined with multi-story buildings adorned with colorful signs in both Japanese and English, enhancing the multicultural atmosphere. Initially, two young women in dresses and face masks are positioned in the right foreground, walking away from the camera, while a brightly lit arcade is visible in the right middle ground. The arcade, with signs reading \"TOY'S CATCHER AND GAME\" and \"AMUFUN,\" has an open front revealing numerous claw machines filled with plush toys, framed by red and green neon lights. On the left, a sign for \"SHOGUN BURGER\" in black text on a white background is mounted on a building. The camera, filmed from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene clear. It moves forward to capture the street view, then gradually pans right to reveal the stores on the right side of the street, providing a dynamic perspective of the arcade and its surroundings. As the camera advances, the two women exit the frame on the right, and the arcade transitions to become the central focus of the frame, remaining in the middle ground and revealing its interior. The movement is slightly unsteady with some noticeable shaking, contributing to the dynamic energy of the scene in the late afternoon light. Several pedestrians, including those inside the game center, contribute to the bustling atmosphere as the artificial lights of the storefronts begin to illuminate the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
