  "merged_caption": "From a fixed locked-on point-of-view shot positioned above and behind the driver, the front half of the light blue, open-wheel race car and the driver's cockpit occupy the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The paved racetrack extends from the immediate foreground, running up the center of the frame into the middle and background. On the left and right sides of the track, rolling green hills stretch from the middle ground to the background, sometimes passing by the foreground when the car is near the side, with an overcast sky filling the top of the frame. As the car accelerates forward, the track and scenery rush toward the camera. The car begins to climb an incline, causing the horizon line and a small white building in the distant background to move to the middle ground as the car ascends the hill. This unsteady, shaky point-of-view shot is captured from a camera mounted on the racing car, which moves forward with the vehicle, panning left and right as the car turns on the track. Filmed from an eye-level, high-angle, the video features mild barrel distortion. A deep focus is used, keeping both the car's interior and the distant track in sharp detail. The driver, wearing a white racing suit with red and black wristbands, black gloves, and a black helmet, is seated in the open cockpit, with their hands visible on the steering wheel. The car, which has \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on its body, travels at high speed along the paved track, steering through a left-hand curve and then proceeding up a steep incline with a slight right-hand curve before beginning another left-hand turn.",

    "Subject": "This video provides a locked-on POV shot from a race car, focusing on the vehicle and its driver. The car is an open-wheel, formula-style racer with a light blue and silver body. The front wheels and suspension are exposed. On the blue section of the car's body, in front of the cockpit, the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" are written in white. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit with red and black wristbands, black gloves, and a black helmet that covers their entire head. Their hands are visible on the steering wheel.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on point-of-view perspective, a race car travels at high speed along a paved track. The driver steers the vehicle through a left-hand curve and then proceeds up a steep incline with a slight right-hand curve before beginning another left-hand turn.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, with the camera mounted behind the driver of a light blue, open-wheel race car, captures a high-speed drive on a paved racetrack. The car, which has \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on its body, speeds along the asphalt track, which features curves and significant elevation changes. The surrounding environment consists of rolling green hills under an overcast, cloudy sky. In the distance, a small white building with a flagpole is visible at the crest of a hill, and the race car gradually approaches this building. The driver, wearing a white racing suit and a black helmet, can be seen in the cockpit navigating the course.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
