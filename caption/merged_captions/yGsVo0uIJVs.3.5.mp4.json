  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a document positioned centrally against a white wall, featuring a black-and-white line drawing in its top half and a dark photograph in its bottom half. The drawing illustrates a fragmented shipwreck, possibly a submarine, with a central, tower-like structure and scattered debris. Below it, the photograph shows what appears to be the same wreck submerged in a dark, murky environment, with a heavily damaged metallic structure partially obscured by shadows and sediment, illuminated by a single light source. The image primarily features dark gray tones with a slight hint of green. A thin red line runs diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, slightly altering its angle as it passes behind the document. An overlay of white text '[S]' is in the lower left corner. The camera, with a deep focus keeping the entire document sharp, slowly and smoothly arcs clockwise on a horizontal plane at the same height as the document, gradually aligning more directly with it. This movement provides a comprehensive view of the document's composition, emphasizing the contrast between the technical drawing and the photograph. The scene is static, with no discernible movement in the images themselves, allowing the viewer to focus on the intricate details of the shipwreck's depiction and its real-world counterpart.",

    "Camera": "With a deep focus keeping the entire document sharp, the camera slowly and smoothly arcs clockwise, examining a page that displays a line drawing and a photograph of a shipwreck.",
    "Subject": "A black-and-white line drawing of a fragmented shipwreck is positioned above a dark, monochrome photograph. The drawing illustrates a large, complex piece of machinery, possibly a submarine, with a central, tower-like structure and scattered debris. Below it, the photograph shows what appears to be the same wreck submerged in a dark, murky environment. The metallic structure in the photo is heavily damaged and partially obscured by shadows and what looks like sediment, illuminated by a single light source, corresponding to the layout in the technical drawing above. The image primarily features dark gray tones with only a slight hint of green.",
    "Motion": "This video features a line drawing and a photograph, with no discernible movement.",
    "Scene": "A document is displayed against a white wall, framed by a thin red diagonal line that slightly alters its angle as it passes behind the document. The document features two images arranged vertically. The top image is a black-and-white line drawing depicting the wreckage of a vessel, possibly a submarine. Below it is a dark, grainy, greenish photograph that appears to be an underwater image of the same wreckage. An overlay of white text '[S]' is in the lower left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
