  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a large, muscular humanoid figure with green skin and short, dark hair, positioned in the center foreground, visible from the waist up. The figure is shirtless, showcasing a highly defined muscular build, and has an intense expression with a wide-open mouth and furrowed brow, suggesting a state of anger or aggression. In the middle ground, a historic stone building with arched structural elements and a glass roof extends across the frame, set against a cloudy sky in the background, creating a gloomy atmosphere. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, features a low-angle shot, looking up at the subject with deep focus, capturing the entire scene clearly. As the figure moves forward, gradually getting closer to the camera, it dramatically throws its arms back while opening its mouth wide, enhancing the impression of an impending roar or shout, and maintains an aggressive stance. The focus transitions to a shallow depth of field, ensuring the figure in the foreground remains sharply in focus. The camera smoothly tilts upward, transitioning the shot to a close-up that fills the center of the frame with the figure's face, while the building behind him becomes obscured. The overall color palette is muted, with earthy tones dominating the scene.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting with a large, muscular green figure in front of a historic building featuring arched structural elements and a glass roof. The environment is characterized by overcast skies with clouds, suggesting a gloomy atmosphere. The building's stone facade and metal framework add a sense of age and grandeur. The scene transitions from a medium view of the figure standing in front of the building to a close-up of its face, capturing its intense expression.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
