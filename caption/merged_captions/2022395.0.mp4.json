  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera is positioned at approximately head height within a dense crowd, looking forward toward a stage. The silhouettes of people occupy the entire foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom and central portions of the frame. Their raised arms frequently extend into the upper half of the frame, partially obscuring the background. In the background and at the top of the frame, stage lights and a disco ball are positioned. Beams of light, alternating between red, blue, and purple, project from the background and ceiling, cutting through the hazy middle ground and illuminating the scene. The crowd members in the foreground and middle ground jump and move, causing their silhouettes and raised hands to shift dynamically within the frame, while the handheld camera experiences slight, natural movements consistent with being in a crowd. The camera moves unsteadily with a lack of a clear pattern, immersed within a dense crowd of silhouetted people who are jumping and dancing. Many individuals in the crowd raise their arms, waving them in the air. The scene is illuminated by dynamic stage lights that flash and sweep across the room, rapidly alternating between intense red, blue, and purple washes of color that create beams through the hazy atmosphere. Occasionally, the small, glowing rectangular screens of smartphones held aloft by some members of the crowd can be seen. The air is thick with haze, illuminated by strobing and shifting stage lights that bathe the room in alternating washes of intense red, deep blue, and vibrant purple. Beams of light cut through the darkness from the ceiling, where a disco ball is occasionally visible. The entire scene is bathed in intense, alternating washes of red, blue, and purple light, which cast long beams through a hazy atmosphere and obscure most of the concertgoers' specific features and clothing.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady, eye-level shot captures a concert crowd from a level angle. The camera's motion lacks a clear pattern, while consistently maintaining a deep focus throughout the video.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective within a dense crowd, numerous people are visible as dark silhouettes against vibrant, shifting stage lights. The individuals, seen from the back, are packed closely together, facing away from the viewer. Many have their arms raised high in the air, some with open palms and others with pointed fingers, as they jump and dance. The entire scene is bathed in intense, alternating washes of red, blue, and purple light, which cast long beams through a hazy atmosphere and obscure most of the concertgoers' specific features and clothing. Occasionally, the small, glowing rectangular screens of smartphones held aloft by some members of the crowd can be seen.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the scene from within a crowded, dark nightclub. The air is thick with haze, illuminated by strobing and shifting stage lights that bathe the room in alternating washes of intense red, deep blue, and vibrant purple. Beams of light cut through the darkness from the ceiling, where a disco ball is occasionally visible. In the foreground and middle ground, the silhouettes of a dense crowd of people are seen from behind, many with their hands raised in the air, dancing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
