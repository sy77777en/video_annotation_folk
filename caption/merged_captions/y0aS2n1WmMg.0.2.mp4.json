  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a white door positioned in the background, flanked by a brown curtain in the left middle ground and a dark wooden shelf in the right middle ground, set against a wall with peeling paint. The door, featuring an arched, frosted glass window at the top, opens inward, revealing a light-skinned man with light brown hair pulled back into a bun, wearing a black t-shirt under a tan jacket. He is visible from the middle of the torso upwards, framed centrally in the doorway at the camera's level. As he steps into the dimly lit indoor entryway from the brighter exterior, he pauses briefly and closes the door, casting the space into near darkness. The camera maintains a very smooth, still eye-level position with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground, capturing the man as his figure becomes more shadowed against the faint light of the door's arched window. As he moves toward the camera, his silhouette fully darkens and enlarges, transitioning into a close-up shot. He pauses briefly in the center of the frame before turning to his right and walking from the middle ground toward the foreground. The video ends just as he is about to exit the left side of the frame, with the camera showing almost imperceptible shaking throughout the sequence.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a very smooth, still eye-level position, the camera maintains a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the midground, with almost imperceptible shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video opens on a white door with a frosted, arched window, which then opens inward to reveal a light-skinned man. He has light brown hair pulled back into a bun and is wearing a black t-shirt under a tan jacket. He steps into the dimly lit room, and as he moves closer to the camera, his figure becomes a dark silhouette against the window.",
    "Motion": "A white door opens inward, revealing a man who steps into the room. He closes the door, pauses briefly, and then walks forward, becoming a silhouette as he moves away from the light of the doorway. As he reaches the front of the camera, he turns to his right.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor entryway, a white door with an arched, frosted glass window at the top is centered. A brown curtain hangs to the left, and a dark wooden shelf is positioned in front of a wall with peeling paint. A man with his hair tied back enters from the brighter exterior, pauses briefly, and closes the door, casting the space into near darkness. He stands in silhouette against the window's faint light before turning and walking deeper into the house.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
