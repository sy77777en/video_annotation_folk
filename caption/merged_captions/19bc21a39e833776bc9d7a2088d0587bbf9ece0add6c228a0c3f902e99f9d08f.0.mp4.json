  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene forest during sunrise, with the entire frame capturing the expansive view of the forest. Tall, slender trees occupy the middle ground and background, their trunks forming vertical lines from the bottom to the top of the frame. The foreground is filled with vibrant purple and green wildflowers, covering the ground densely. Sunlight streams through the trees, creating bright spots and casting shadows on the flowers and the forest floor. The sun's rays are prominently visible in the center-right portion of the frame, radiating outward. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the forest setting. The video captures a serene forest scene with tall trees standing closely together, their trunks dark and their leaves lush green. The forest floor is blanketed with a dense carpet of purple and white flowers, creating a vibrant and colorful landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting a warm glow and creating a starburst effect as it penetrates the canopy. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and tranquil, with the interplay of light and shadow enhancing the natural beauty of the forest. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining a deep focus and large depth of field. The camera remains completely static, capturing the scene without any movement or shaking. Butterflies flutter among the flowers, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the scene. The sun's rays filter through the foliage, casting a warm, golden glow across the scene. The atmosphere is calm and natural, with the interplay of light and shadow enhancing the tranquil beauty of the forest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
