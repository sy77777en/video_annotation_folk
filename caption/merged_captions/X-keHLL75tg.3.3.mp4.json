  "merged_caption": "The video begins by revealing a pair of black boots walking on a textured concrete floor that occupies the entire frame. The camera, initially positioned at a high, eye-level angle, tilts upward to a level perspective, transitioning to a medium close-up that shows a woman in equestrian attire positioned in the center-right foreground and the head of a white horse in the left foreground. The woman is dressed in tall black riding boots with brown shin guards, white breeches, a dark navy riding jacket, black gloves, and a black helmet with a gold-colored trim. Her brown hair is tied back in a low bun. She is holding a blue rope attached to the white horse's brown leather bridle with gold-colored hardware. The horse stands calmly as the woman gently strokes its neck and face with her right hand. A reddish-brown wooden stall is visible in the middle ground on the left. The video uses a shallow depth of field; while the ground initially appears sharp, the upward tilt makes it clear that the focus is on the foreground subjects, leaving the background blurred. Throughout the final shot, the camera moves slightly forward towards the woman's face while remaining at the subjects' level, emphasizing her interaction with the horse.",

    "Camera": "Initially positioned at a high, eye-level angle, the very smooth camera tilts up to a level perspective, revealing a woman in riding gear with a white horse. The video uses a shallow depth of field; while the ground initially appears sharp, the upward tilt makes it clear that the focus is on the foreground subjects, leaving the background blurred. The camera then slightly moves forward to focus on the woman's face as she interacts with the horse.",
    "Subject": "A woman dressed in equestrian attire stands beside a white horse. She is wearing tall black riding boots with brown shin guards, white breeches, a dark navy riding jacket, black gloves, and a black helmet with a gold-colored trim. Her brown hair is tied back in a low bun. The woman is gently stroking the horse's neck behind its left ear with her right hand, while holding a blue rope tied to the horse's bridle with her left hand. The white horse is wearing a brown leather bridle with gold-colored metal hardware and stands calmly as the woman interacts with it.",
    "Motion": "An equestrian in black riding boots walks forward and stops next to a white horse inside a stable. The camera pans up to show the equestrian, dressed in full riding attire, holding a blue rope attached to the horse's brown leather bridle. The equestrian then gently strokes the horse's neck and face with a gloved hand while the horse stands calmly.",
    "Scene": "Within a stable, a woman in equestrian attire, including tall black boots, white pants, and a black jacket, stands on a light-colored, textured concrete floor. She is holding a blue rope attached to the white horse's brown leather bridle with gold-colored hardware. Just behind the horse in the middleground, a reddish-brown wooden stall is visible. The woman, also wearing a black helmet and gloves, gently strokes the horse's head.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
