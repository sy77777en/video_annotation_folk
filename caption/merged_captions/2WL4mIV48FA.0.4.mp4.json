  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot from a fixed camera positioned just above and behind a racing driver's head, creating a point-of-view perspective. The front half of the race car occupies the bottom portion of the frame in the foreground, with the driver's helmet at the bottom center. The asphalt track extends from the foreground into the middle ground, where it begins to curve to the left. This track is flanked by rolling green hills in the middle ground and background on both the left and right sides of the frame, while a cloudy sky fills the top portion. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera moves forward, trucking to the right and then to the left as the car navigates the track. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the car's cockpit to the distant hills, sharp. The car maintains a forward trajectory, with a slight shift to the right and then to the left, with the driver's hands visible on the steering wheel. The car's bodywork is predominantly bright blue, with \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on the section in front of the cockpit, while the nose cone is a silver-gray. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit, black gloves with red accents, and a black helmet that obscures their face. Their gloved hands are visible on the steering wheel, which is equipped with a small digital display and multiple buttons. The track is straight before it curves to the left, flanked by vast, rolling green hills that meet a cloudy, overcast sky. A left turnoff, marked by bright orange traffic cones, indicates it is not the correct path. Small structures or buildings are visible on the left side of the track.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, point-of-view shot from a race car, captured from a high angle, eye-level perspective. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera moves forward, trucking to the right and then to the left as the car navigates the track. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the car's cockpit to the distant hills, sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a locked-on POV mounted just above and behind the driver's head, the video shows a person driving an open-wheel formula-style race car. The car's bodywork is predominantly bright blue, with \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on the section in front of the cockpit, while the nose cone is a silver-gray. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit, black gloves with red accents, and a black helmet that obscures their face. Their gloved hands are visible on the steering wheel, which is equipped with a small digital display and multiple buttons.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on POV, a formula-style race car travels forward along a straight section of a paved race track. The car maintains a forward trajectory, with a slight shift to the right and then to the left, with the driver's hands visible on the steering wheel.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a light blue, open-wheel race car captures the vehicle speeding along an asphalt track. The track is straight before it curves to the left, flanked by vast, rolling green hills that meet a cloudy, overcast sky. A left turnoff, marked by bright orange traffic cones, indicates it is not the correct path. Small structures or buildings are visible on the left side of the track. The car's body is marked with white text reading \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" From this perspective over the driver's helmet, the front wheels and suspension are visible as the car approaches the turn.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
