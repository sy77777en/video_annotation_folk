  "merged_caption": "The video showcases an extreme wide shot of a cityscape during sunset, captured from an aerial perspective with noticeable fisheye distortion curving straight lines outward. The camera smoothly transitions from a 90-degree rotated angle to a high angle, then returns to a level angle, demonstrating skilled and complex drone maneuvers. Initially, the camera focuses on a construction site in the middle ground, located towards the bottom left of the frame. As the video progresses, the drone dives downward before stabilizing its view, with pronounced rolling movements, transitioning the construction site from the foreground to the middle ground. The tall buildings with illuminated windows move from the right side of the frame into the center, occupying the middle ground and background. The sky, with its blend of soft blues and warm oranges, remains consistently in the background throughout the video. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the city, providing a sweeping aerial perspective. The streets and scattered lights appear in the lower part of the frame, enhancing the depth of the scene. The video begins with a view of a cityscape at dusk, featuring a construction site with buildings and cranes in the background. The camera starts to tilt downward, gradually revealing more of the cityscape and the construction site below. As the camera continues to move downward, the construction site becomes more prominent, with visible structures and equipment. The camera then tilts upward to a level angle, showing a broader view of the construction site and the surrounding buildings. The video concludes with a wide view of the construction site and the cityscape, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level, transitioning from a 90-degree rotated angle to a high angle, then back to a level angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone executes skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, with pronounced rolling movements. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the urban environment with a focus on the architecture and skyline rather than a specific object. The scene includes tall buildings with illuminated windows, construction cranes, and a vibrant sunset sky, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the city. The dynamic angles and lighting highlight the bustling and expansive nature of the urban landscape, creating a sense of movement and energy without centering on a single subject.",

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment during sunset. The setting is outdoors, showcasing a cityscape with a mix of modern high-rise buildings and construction sites. The sky is a blend of soft blues and warm oranges, indicating the transition from day to night. Notable visual elements include cranes and partially constructed structures, suggesting ongoing development. The buildings are primarily glass and steel, reflecting the fading sunlight. Streets below are visible, with scattered lights beginning to illuminate the scene. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the drone's movement providing a sweeping perspective of the city's architectural features and the vibrant colors of the sunset.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
