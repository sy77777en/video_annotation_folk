  "merged_caption": "The video begins with dark, out-of-focus elements in the bottom left and bottom right foreground, partially obscuring the view. A white door is visible in the middle ground, slightly right of center, with a young woman initially seen in the background through its opening, positioned centrally within the doorway. Initially partially obscured by a dark foreground element, the young woman with dark hair pulled back and a light skin tone is revealed as she opens the white door from the other side by turning its silver-colored handle and pushing it away from herself, then steps forward into the doorway. She is wearing a plain grey short-sleeved shirt. As she opens the door towards the right side of the frame and steps forward, the shot transitions to a medium shot of her. She moves from the background to the middle ground, occupying the center of the frame. The open door, initially in the middle ground on the left, transitions to the middle ground on the right due to camera movements, and its silver handle, initially on the left side from the viewer's perspective, is seen on the right side by the end of the scene. The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be an evenly lit room. The walls visible are plain and light-toned. The overall lighting is balanced, creating a calm atmosphere. When the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level and maintains a level angle. It uses shallow focus, concentrating on the girl positioned in the middle ground. There is some minor, slightly unsteady movement as the camera pans from left to right, with some shaking.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
