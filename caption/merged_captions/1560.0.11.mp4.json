  "merged_caption": "This video opens with a low-angle wide shot, placing a large, green-patinated equestrian statue in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The statue, depicting a figure on horseback wearing what appears to be a crown or halo and holding a tall weapon, is mounted on a substantial light-colored stone pedestal. The statue is set against a historic, light-colored stone building identified as Fisherman's Bastion, characterized by its conical towers and arched walkways in the background. Green, leafy trees are positioned in the middle ground to the left and right. The camera moves forward quickly and smoothly from a low angle, tilting up to highlight the central equestrian statue, causing the framing to transition into a full shot where the statue and its pedestal become the dominant central element, filling more of the frame. As the camera moves forward, the statue remains consistently centered and in sharp focus, while the rapid movement causes the surrounding buildings and trees to appear slightly blurry. The scene is set against a pale blue sky with soft white clouds during the day, captured by a drone in Budapest.",

    "Subject": "A large, green, patinated equestrian statue stands at the center, depicting a figure on horseback. The rider, wearing what appears to be a crown or halo, holds a tall weapon in one hand. The statue is mounted on a large, light-colored stone pedestal. In the background, a light-colored stone building features several conical towers with pointed roofs. To the left and right of the central statue are green, leafy trees.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward, tilting up to highlight the central equestrian statue, which remains consistently centered in the frame. The surrounding trees and architecture remain still as the camera's motion creates a slight blur.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a low-angle, dynamic shot of a large, green-patinated equestrian statue in Budapest. The statue, depicting a figure on horseback holding a weapon, is positioned on a substantial stone pedestal. In the background stands a historic, light-colored stone building, identified as Fisherman's Bastion, characterized by its conical towers and arched walkways. Green trees are visible on the sides, and the scene is set against a pale blue sky with soft white clouds during the day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
