  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a city skyline at night from a low angle, captured from a high vantage point several stories up. The dark silhouettes of rooftops occupy the foreground across the bottom of the frame, with a line of illuminated buildings positioned far behind them. The vast night sky, filled with large, purple-hued storm clouds, dominates more than three-fourths of the frame. Bright flashes of purple and white lightning intermittently illuminate the clouds, concentrated in the center and left areas of the scene, creating a spectacular and turbulent display against the dark sky. A tall, lit skyscraper is visible in the distant background on the right side. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and although the camera's position remains fixed, it smoothly pans left throughout the shot. This time-lapse video captures the dynamic motion of the powerful thunderstorm over the city at night, with brilliant flashes of lightning continuously illuminating the dark, turbulent clouds from within. Below the storm, the silhouette of rooftops occupies the foreground, while further in the distance, various buildings are brightly lit with yellow and white lights, establishing the urban setting. The dramatic light show unfolds above the city's illuminated skyline, with a distinct skyscraper visible on the horizon.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a high vantage point several stories up, using a low angle to look up at the stormy sky. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot features a very smooth pan to the left.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot at night, dominated by a powerful thunderstorm. Brilliant flashes of purple and white lightning illuminate a large bank of clouds from within, creating a spectacular and turbulent display against the dark sky. Below the storm, the silhouette of rooftops occupies the foreground, while further in the distance, various buildings are brightly lit with yellow and white lights, establishing the urban setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm over a city at night. Brilliant flashes of lightning continuously illuminate the dark, turbulent clouds from within. The dramatic light show unfolds above the city's illuminated skyline.",
    "Scene": "A nighttime view over a city captures a dramatic thunderstorm in progress. The dark sky is filled with large, purple-hued storm clouds that are intermittently and intensely illuminated from within by bright white and purple lightning. Below the turbulent sky, a cityscape is visible, with the dark silhouettes of residential rooftops in the foreground. In the mid-ground and distance, various buildings are lit with yellow and white lights, and a taller, distinct skyscraper can be seen on the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
