  "merged_caption": "The video displays a medium full shot of a person, likely a man based on build, in an orange, ribbed spacesuit with green gloves and dark blue straps crossing on his abdomen, initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, framed by a padded doorway in the foreground. He wears a green helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is partially visible. Yellow, rectangular packs with some visible dials and buttons are attached to both the front and back of the suit. The scene is set indoors, within a brightly lit, futuristic corridor or room. An open doorway, lined with a distinctive padded, chevron-like texture, is prominent. Padded walls are visible to the left and right in the foreground and middle ground, with light panels at the top in the background and a button-covered wall section in the top right background. The camera is positioned at ground level, looking upward with a deep focus and a large depth of field. As the person steps through the doorway and walks across the frame towards the wall on the right, the camera rolls counterclockwise and tracks their movement, causing the person's 2D position to shift from the center towards the center-left side of the frame, transitioning from the middle ground to the foreground and appearing larger in the frame. Rectangular, translucent light panels illuminate the space, and sections of a wall appear to be composed of numerous small, navy, blue, and yellow rectangular buttons. The camera follows the person's walking path, maintaining focus on their movement as they move towards the wall on the right.",

Padded walls are visible to the left and right in the foreground and middle ground, with light panels at the top in the background and a button-covered wall section in the top right background. The camera is positioned at ground level, looking upward, as the person walks over the camera and moves towards the wall on the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
