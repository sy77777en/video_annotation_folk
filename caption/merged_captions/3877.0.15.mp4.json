  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot. The Macpac logo and the text \"macpac\" are overlaid in the center of the frame, appearing in the foreground relative to the landscape. A large rocky cliff occupies the right side of the frame in the foreground. Five people are positioned on this cliff on the right: one person stands at the top right, wearing outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, including a jacket and pants with a neutral color palette, while four others are climbing vertically below them, with the person in the middle wearing gray clothing. These subjects are in the foreground. A body of water is visible in the bottom left and center-left in the middle ground, with distant mountains filling the background across the top and left portions of the frame. The video, filmed by a drone, captures a dramatic outdoor scene featuring a rugged mountain landscape with jagged edges, overlooking a vast expanse of distant mountains and a serene body of water below. The time of day appears to be overcast, with a sky filled with clouds casting a muted light over the scene. The cliff is composed of dark, textured rock, adding a sense of scale to the towering formation. Shortly after the video begins, the text \"weather anything\" fades in below the \"macpac\" text in the central overlay. The camera, at an aerial level and employing deep focus with a large depth of field, smoothly moves backward and slightly downward as the video progresses, capturing multiple climbers on a rocky cliff. As the camera moves backward, the Macpac logo appears prominently in the center of the screen, and the text 'weather anything' gradually appears below the logo, completing the Macpac advertisement. The background remains consistent, showcasing the rugged mountains and a body of water in the distance.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a level angle, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves backward and downward, capturing multiple climbers on a rocky cliff.",
    "Subject": "The video features a rugged mountain landscape with a prominent rocky cliff. At the top of the cliff, a person stands, wearing outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, including a jacket and pants, with a neutral color palette. Below, four individuals are climbing the rock face. The person in the middle is wearing gray clothing. The climbers are positioned vertically along the cliff, showcasing their ascent. The scene emphasizes the adventurous nature of the subjects, highlighting their engagement with the challenging terrain.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a wide shot of a mountainous landscape, featuring a steep cliff with a person standing at the top. Below the cliff, four individuals are suspended in a vertical chain, each holding onto the leg or clothing of the person above them. As the camera moves backward, the Macpac logo appears prominently in the center of the screen. The text 'weather anything' gradually appears below the logo, completing the Macpac advertisement. The background remains consistent, showcasing the rugged mountains and a body of water in the distance.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures a dramatic outdoor scene featuring a rugged mountain landscape. The setting is a rocky cliff with jagged edges, overlooking a vast expanse of distant mountains and a serene body of water below. The time of day appears to be overcast, with a sky filled with clouds casting a muted light over the scene. The cliff is composed of dark, textured rock, with one individual standing on the cliff and four others forming a vertical human chain at the edge, adding a sense of scale to the towering formation. The video includes overlay elements, such as a prominent logo and text in the center, reading \"macpac\" and \"weather anything,\" which are not part of the natural scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
