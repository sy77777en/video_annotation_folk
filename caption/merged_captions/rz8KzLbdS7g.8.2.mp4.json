  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from an eye-level perspective, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire street scene sharp. The scene begins with a traditional Japanese house positioned in the right foreground and middle ground, featuring a light gray-blue tiled roof, wooden beams, and red curtains in the doorway. A chain-link fence is in the bottom right foreground, while a street occupies the bottom left. The camera, slightly unsteady, begins with a slow pan to the left, causing the house to move out of the frame to the right. This movement reveals more of the quiet residential street corner in Japan, set on a bright, sunny day. As the camera trucks left along the road, the street corner becomes the central focus. A convex traffic mirror on a pole stands prominently in the center-left middle ground, reflecting the scene. A concrete block wall and fence run along the bottom of the frame. In the background, other houses with tiled roofs are visible behind lush green trees and bushes, all under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's deliberate movement is intended to showcase the environment itself, emphasizing the peaceful and ordinary character of the suburban setting rather than any specific action or object.",

    "Subject": "This is a residential scenery shot capturing a quiet street corner in a Japanese neighborhood on a bright, sunny day. The view pans slowly from a traditional-style house with a tiled roof and red curtains to reveal the narrow street, which is lined with concrete block walls, modern fences, and other homes. Lush green trees and bushes add to the tranquil atmosphere under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds, while a convex traffic mirror stands prominently at the corner.

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans left along a quiet residential street in Japan on a sunny day. The camera moves from a traditional-style house with a light gray-blue tiled roof, wooden beams, and red curtains in the doorway to reveal the surrounding neighborhood. The house is bordered by a low chain-link fence and a concrete block wall. As the view shifts, a convex traffic mirror on a pole comes into view, reflecting the scene. In the background, other houses with tiled roofs are visible behind green trees and bushes, all under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
