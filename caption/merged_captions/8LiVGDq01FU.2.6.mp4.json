  "merged_caption": "A medium shot centrally frames a middle-aged man with light skin, shown from the chest up, wearing a white and black spacesuit with a circular blue NASA patch on his chest and a rectangular black name tag that reads \"COOPER\" on his left side, which appears on the right side of the frame. He is positioned in the foreground, situated within a vast, dimly lit, and complex multi-dimensional structure of intersecting planes and corridors that extend from the foreground to the background, creating a symmetrical and immersive environment. The spacesuit contrasts with the dark, predominantly brown and black surroundings. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves smoothly forward with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the astronaut's helmet. The man floats in the center of the frame, facing forward, with his head tilting slightly upward and then turning slightly from side to side before maintaining a fixed position. His arms are spread open, and his facial expression appears fearful, showing an expression of intense concentration through the clear visor of his matching helmet. The lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the intricate geometry of the abstract structure, creating an infinite lattice-like effect.",

    "Camera": "This is a level-angle shot where the camera moves smoothly forward. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the astronaut's helmet.",
    "Subject": "A middle-aged man with light skin is shown from the chest up, facing forward. He is wearing a white and black spacesuit with a circular blue NASA patch centrally positioned on his chest and a rectangular black name tag that reads \"COOPER\" on his left side, which appears on the right side of the frame. He wears a matching helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is visible, showing an expression of intense concentration.",
    "Motion": "The man in the spacesuit floats in the center of the frame, facing forward. His head tilts slightly upward and then turns slightly from side to side before maintaining a fixed position. His arms are spread open, and his facial expression appears fearful.",
    "Scene": "An astronaut in a white spacesuit is positioned in the center of a vast, dimly lit, and complex interior space. This environment is a multi-dimensional grid composed of countless intersecting planes and corridors that stretch into the distance in all directions, creating an infinite lattice-like effect. The spacesuit, marked with a circular blue NASA logo and the name \"COOPER\" on a patch, contrasts with the dark, predominantly brown and black surroundings. The lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the intricate geometry of the abstract structure.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot centrally frames an astronaut from the chest up. He is positioned in the foreground, situated within a complex, multi-dimensional structure of intersecting planes that extend from the foreground to the background, creating a symmetrical and immersive environment. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
