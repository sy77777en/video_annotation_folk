  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a woman with long, straight hair, partially visible on the left side of the frame, wearing a light-colored garment. She is positioned in the foreground, facing away from the camera, which is at eye level with a level angle and a shallow depth of field, focusing on her. The scene is set in an indoor studio environment, characterized by dim lighting and technical equipment, including a visible light source on the right side of the frame, creating a silhouette effect around the woman. The video begins with a dark background and the text \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" prominently displayed in the lower left corner. As the frames progress, the lighting gradually increases, revealing more details of the woman's hair and the equipment in the background. The woman remains stationary, facing away from the camera, while the light source in front of her becomes more intense, illuminating her silhouette. The background equipment, including a camera and lights, becomes more visible as the lighting continues to brighten. The video concludes with the woman's silhouette clearly outlined against the bright light, and the text remains on the screen. The camera captures her from an over-the-shoulder perspective, placing her slightly off-center to the left, with no movement or shaking throughout the video. The environment suggests a focus on technology, with the presence of projection equipment, and the time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor setting and artificial lighting. The camera maintains a consistent angle and distance, with no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements within the frame.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character, capturing a portion of their upper body from the left side of the frame and the scene ahead. The environment is dimly lit, suggesting a controlled lighting setup, possibly in a studio or a similar space. The background features technical equipment, including a visible light source that emits a bright glow, creating a contrast against the darker surroundings. The scene is characterized by a focus on technology, with the presence of projection equipment. The time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor setting and artificial lighting. Overlay elements include the text \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" prominently displayed in the lower left corner, providing context for the scene without being part of the physical environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a close-up shot of a woman, with her head and the right side of her shoulder partially visible on the left side of the frame. She is positioned in the foreground, facing away from the camera. Her long, straight hair and light-colored garment are visible. The camera captures her from an over-the-shoulder perspective, placing her slightly off-center to the left. In the middle of the frame, technical equipment is visible, reflecting light. There is one bright light source visible on the right side of the frame, creating a silhouette effect around the woman. The text \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" is overlaid in the lower left corner of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent angle and distance. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
