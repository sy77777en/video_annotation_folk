  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective inside a spaceship cockpit, the scene opens with the ship's dashboard in the foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame. The dashboard features a black screen and another screen on the left displaying a schematic of the ship's systems. Overlays on the screen display gameplay information such as \"(Hold) Match Velocity\" and \"Landing Mode\" in the top left, and location details like \"Ember Twin\" along with speed and equipment options like \"Unbuckle,\" \"Equip Scout Launcher,\" and \"Equip Signalscope\" in the top right. A large, reddish-brown, cratered planet with deep canyons fills the upper and right portions of the view, while a bright orange sun with visible solar flares is positioned in the lower-left background against a star-filled sky. The viewpoint moves forward, and the craft flies between the sun and the planet, entering a deep canyon on the planet's surface. As the ship progresses, the canyon walls move past on the top and right sides of the frame. The camera moves smoothly forward through the canyon, entering a narrow crack and rolling counterclockwise by 180 degrees to navigate the passage. A large, complex, metallic structure, shaped like a cross within a ring and adorned with glowing purple lights, appears in the upper-left middle ground, and a faint, glowing white wisp becomes visible in the center of the canyon ahead. The sun exits the frame from the center-top during the middle of the video as the spaceship moves. In the distance, a faint, glowing, geometric structure can be seen. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the cockpit interior to the distant planets, sharp, while the movement is fluid with some randomness in its path as it travels through the complex expanse of outer space.",

    "Subject": "This video shows a first-person perspective from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The dashboard in the foreground features a black screen and another screen on the left displaying a schematic of the ship's systems. Through the cockpit window, a large, bright orange sun with visible solar flares occupies the lower-left portion of the view. A massive, reddish-brown, cratered planet with deep canyons dominates the upper and right sides of the scene. A large, complex, metallic structure, shaped like a cross within a ring and adorned with glowing purple lights, floats in space above the planet's surface. A faint, glowing, white wisp of light is also visible within one of the planet's canyons against the backdrop of star-filled space.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective inside a spaceship's cockpit, the craft flies forward, passing between a large, bright sun and a massive, cratered planet. The ship then enters a deep canyon on the planet's surface, continuing its forward trajectory. As it travels through the canyon, a large, floating metallic structure and a small, glowing wisp of light come into view.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the cockpit of a spaceship flying through a deep canyon on a reddish, rocky celestial body. A massive, glowing orange sun with visible solar flares dominates the lower left, illuminating the dark, star-filled space and the craggy canyon walls. In the distance, a faint, glowing, geometric structure can be seen. The foreground shows the spaceship's dashboard, featuring a screen with a ship schematic. Overlays are present on the screen, displaying gameplay information such as \"(Hold) Match Velocity\" and \"Landing Mode\" in the top left, and location details like \"Ember Twin\" along with speed and equipment options like \"Unbuckle,\" \"Equip Scout Launcher,\" and \"Equip Signalscope\" in the top right.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective inside a spaceship cockpit, the scene opens with the ship's dashboard in the foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame. A large, reddish-brown planet fills the upper and right portions of the view, while a bright orange sun is positioned in the lower-left background against a star-filled sky. The viewpoint moves forward and descends into a canyon on the planet. As the ship progresses, the canyon walls move past on the top and right sides of the frame. A large, metallic, cross-shaped structure appears in the upper-left middle ground, and a faint, glowing white wisp becomes visible in the center of the canyon ahead. The sun exits the frame from the center-top during the middle of the video as the spaceship moves."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
