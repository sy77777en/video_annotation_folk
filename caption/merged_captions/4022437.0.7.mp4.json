  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, angled with its rear left corner in the bottom right foreground. The car's open left-side doors extend towards the left side of the frame, creating depth. The light-colored interior features beige or tan leather seats, door panels, and wood trim accents. The glossy black exterior is complemented by silver five-spoke alloy wheels, tinted windows, and a sunroof. Small red reflectors are present on the inner edges of the open doors. In the background, two plain, light-colored buildings sit behind the car, with trees to the left and a crane in the top right. The asphalt parking lot occupies the bottom foreground and extends into the midground, marked with white lines. The camera begins at a hip-level, level angle and smoothly moves backward while maintaining a consistent level angle, transitioning the view into a wide shot. As the camera retreats, more of the car and the surrounding paved lot and buildings are revealed, with additional structures visible in the distance under a bright sky. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot. This movement makes the car appear smaller while it remains centrally located, revealing more of the parking lot in the foreground and a wider perspective of the background elements. The camera concludes with a slight truck to the right, providing a comprehensive view of the entire vehicle, with the Mercedes emblem noticeable on the rear left wheel. The car itself does not move throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "This shot of a black Mercedes begins at a hip-level, level angle. The camera smoothly moves backward while maintaining a consistent level angle, concluding with a slight truck to the right. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a comprehensive view of a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan from the rear left corner. Initially, the S550 badging on the back is not visible, but the Mercedes emblem is noticeable on the rear left wheel. Both front  doors and the rear left-side doors are wide open, showcasing the light-colored interior with beige or tan leather seats, door panels, and wood trim accents. The car features a glossy black exterior, silver five-spoke alloy wheels, tinted windows, and a sunroof. Small red reflectors are present on the inner edges of the open doors. As the camera gradually moves backward, the entire vehicle is revealed, with several buildings visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "From a level-angle view at the rear left corner of a stationary black sedan with its doors open, the camera slowly and steadily pulls backward. As the camera retreats, more of the car and the surrounding paved lot and buildings are revealed. The car itself does not move throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "A black sedan with a tan leather interior is parked in an asphalt lot during the day, with both left-side doors open. The car features silver, five-spoke wheels. In the background, two plain, light-colored buildings stand behind the car, with additional structures visible in the distance, along with trees and a distant construction crane under a bright sky. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing more of the paved lot marked with white lines.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
