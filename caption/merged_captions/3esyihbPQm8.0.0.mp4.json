  "merged_caption": "A man in a wingsuit is captured in a full shot, occupying the center-foreground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, initially angled downwards and then shifting to an upward angle due to the soaring turn. Below him, a steep, rocky mountain face fills the bottom half of the frame in the middle ground, while an overcast sky is visible in the top background. The man remains relatively static in his central position as the rocky terrain rushes upward toward the camera, creating a dynamic sense of rapid forward and downward movement. The video is captured from a helmet-mounted camera, providing a low-angle view that captures the wingsuit flyer descending from above, creating the impression of looking up at them during their fall. As the flyer launches from the cliff, the camera moves backward and then continues smoothly downward and backward to match their descent. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping both the flyer in the foreground and the rocky cliff face visible behind them in sharp detail. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. The man, a light-skinned individual with a light-colored goatee, is shown in mid-air from a helmet-mounted camera perspective. He is wearing a white helmet with an orange \"numa\" logo, black windproof goggles, and a black and yellow wingsuit with white panels on the underside of the wings. Blue straps are fastened across his chest, and black and white patterned straps for his equipment are visible, positioned vertically from his shoulders. His mouth is open, and his face shows an expression of intense concentration. The rugged mountain terrain, composed of layered, craggy rock, rushes upward toward the camera under a flat, overcast white sky.",

    "Motion": "A man in a wingsuit jumps off a cliff and skillfully glides close to its rocky surface, maintaining a stable flying posture throughout his descent.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a helmet, the perspective looks down past a person in a wingsuit as they fly extremely close to a steep, grey rock face. The rugged mountain terrain, composed of layered, craggy rock, rushes upward toward the camera under a flat, overcast white sky. The person is wearing a white helmet, dark sunglasses, and a black and yellow wingsuit with a blue harness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
