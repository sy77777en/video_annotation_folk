  "merged_caption": "The video is captured in a wide shot from an oblique top-down perspective, showcasing a pixel-art golf course. A pixelated player character with short brown hair, wearing a green shirt and brown pants, stands on a putting green, with the hole and red flag positioned slightly above them. The scene features a green fairway surrounded by trees, a sand trap to the left, and a body of water on the far left. A dirt path runs across the bottom of the frame. Various user interface elements are overlaid: information panels in the top-left corner indicate \"2ND\", \"PAR 4 363.3Y\", and the player's score \"E 3RD\"; a distance marker to the pin is in the top center; a wind indicator shows \"3Y\" in the top right; a club selection labeled \"RUTTER PUDDLE WEDGE\" is on the left edge; a \"NORMAL\" power bar is also on the left; a power meter at the bottom center shows \"16Y\"; and a golf ball icon labeled \"FAIRWAY 0Y RANGE\" is in the bottom-right corner. The pixelated character swings a club, chipping a golf ball. The camera smoothly follows the ball, moving upward and rightward as it travels in a short arc, lands on the green, and rolls directly into the hole. As the ball approaches the hole, a distance counter in the top center decreases. When the ball drops in, the camera shakes slightly to mimic the impact. After the ball lands in the hole, large, stylized words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in purple and green pixelated text in the center, overlaying the player character.",

    "Subject": "This video displays a pixel art golf game featuring a player character with short brown hair, wearing a green shirt and brown pants. The game's user interface is also rendered in a pixelated style, with indicators for the hole number, par, distance, and wind. A club selection shows the name \"PUDDLE WEDGE,\" and a power meter is present at the bottom of the screen. At one point, the large, stylized words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in purple and green pixelated text.",
    "Motion": "A pixelated character on a golf green swings a club, chipping a golf ball. The ball travels in a short arc, lands on the green, and rolls directly into the hole. Following this, large, stylized text appears on the screen.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases a pixel-art golf course from an oblique top-down view, enhancing the visual experience. The scene features a green fairway and a putting green with a red flag in the hole, surrounded by trees and a sand trap. A body of water is visible on the left, and a dirt path runs along the bottom. A pixelated golfer on the green swings their club, sending the ball into the hole. The scene includes numerous overlay elements: in the top left corner, text indicates \"2ND\", \"PAR 4 363.3Y\", and the player's score \"E 3RD\"; in the top center, a distance marker to the pin is displayed; in the top right, a wind indicator shows \"3Y\". On the left, a \"NORMAL\" power bar and a club selection labeled \"RUTTER PUDDLE WEDGE\" are visible. At the bottom, a power meter shows \"16Y\", and on the right, a golf ball icon is labeled \"FAIRWAY 0Y RANGE\". After the ball goes in the hole, the words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in large, colorful text in the center of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "The video is captured in a wide shot from an oblique top-down perspective. A pixelated player character stands on a putting green, with the hole and flag positioned slightly above them. The golf ball travels from the player's position toward the hole. There are some trees scattered above and to the right of the green, with grass surrounding it. A sand trap is to the left, and a body of water is on the far left. A dirt path runs across the bottom of the frame. Various user interface elements are overlaid: information panels are in the top-left and top-right corners, a club selection is on the left edge, a power meter is at the bottom center, and a ball icon is in the bottom-right corner. As the ball approaches the hole, a distance counter in the top center decreases. After the ball lands in the hole, large text reading \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appears in the center, overlaying the player character."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
