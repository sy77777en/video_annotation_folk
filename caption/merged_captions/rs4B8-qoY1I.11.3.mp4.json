  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, two humanoid warrior characters, clad in ornate silver and gold armor and wielding glowing swords—one red and one yellow—are initially positioned in the center middle ground on a circular platform within a dark, cavernous tower level. The environment is illuminated by a fiery red and orange glow from large pillars and luminous patterns on the stone floor. The camera, from a high aerial angle, tracks the warriors as they run toward the bottom right of the frame. As the camera moves right and down, a spidery demon with a dark red and black coloration, identified as a \"Terror Demon,\" scuttles into view from the bottom right, moving to the center to engage the warriors in combat. The demon's upper torso is humanoid but skeletal, with glowing green highlights and sharp claws. The warriors turn and swing their glowing swords, striking the demon. The demon lunges forward in retaliation, and the warriors deliver a second, fatal sword strike, causing the demon to explode and fly upward. Throughout the scene, game interface elements are dynamic: a minimap and objectives list in the top right corner indicate the location as \"Besieged Tower Level 1\" with the task to \"Kill Cimeries,\" while the top left displays character information. The bottom of the screen shows a health orb, a resource orb, and an action bar, which changes during combat. A chat box is present in the bottom left corner. During the battle, a health bar labeled \"TERROR DEMON\" appears at the top center of the screen. Following the fight, the camera makes a slight downward and leftward shift, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera tracks the game's avatars, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. It initially moves right and down, then holds steady as the characters engage a monster in combat. Following the fight, the camera makes a slight downward and leftward shift.",
    "Subject": "Two humanoid warrior characters are depicted wearing full suits of ornate, bulky armor in shades of silver and gold, each equipped with shields. One warrior wields a longsword that emits a bright red glow, while the other carries a sword with a yellow hue. Accompanying them is a flame-like humanoid figure running alongside. They confront a demonic creature, identified as a \"Terror Demon,\" which has a spidery, insectoid lower body with multiple sharp, dark red legs. The demon's upper torso is more humanoid but skeletal, with glowing green highlights on its limbs and sharp claws. The creature's overall coloration is a mix of dark red and black.",
    "Motion": "Two armored warriors run on a circular platform as a spidery demon scuttles into view from the bottom right. The warriors turn and swing glowing red swords, striking the demon. The demon lunges forward in retaliation, and the warriors deliver a second, fatal sword strike, causing the demon to explode and fly upward.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a dark, cavernous tower level. The environment is illuminated by a fiery red and orange glow from large, thick pillars and intricate, luminous patterns etched into the dark stone floor. Two large, pulsating red objects are present: one in the left-bottom foreground and the other in the right-top background. Two humanoid warrior characters are running towards the bottom right of the frame on a circular platform before a red, spider-like demon appears and engages in combat. The scene includes several game interface overlays: a minimap and an objectives list in the top right corner indicate the location is \"Besieged Tower Level 1\" and the task is to \"Kill Cimeries.\" The top left corner displays character information, while the bottom of the screen shows a health orb, a resource orb, and an action bar. A chat box is present in the bottom left corner. During combat, a health bar labeled \"TERROR DEMON\" appears above the enemy.",
    "Spatial": "In a high-angle wide shot, two warrior characters are initially positioned in the center middle ground on a circular platform. As the camera moves toward the bottom right of the frame, a spidery demon enters from the bottom right and moves to the center to engage the warriors in combat within the middle ground. Throughout the scene, game interface elements are dynamic: the minimap and objectives list change as the warriors move, lines in the chat box disappear, and the health/resource orbs roll. The action bar at the bottom also changes during combat. During the battle, a health bar for the demon appears at the top center of the screen."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
