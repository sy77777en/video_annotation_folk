  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a waterfall. Initially, the cascading water occupies the center of the frame in the foreground. A light-colored rock face with dark veining is visible in the background and on the left, while a patch of green foliage is positioned in the background on the right. The camera, positioned at a level height with the waterfall, begins at a level angle and smoothly tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle view of the waterfall. As it moves, the background becomes darker, highlighting the countless individual droplets at the center of the frame, emphasizing the continuous downward motion of the water. The foliage on the right gradually shifts upward until it completely disappears from the frame, leaving only the countless individual droplets in the center in sharper focus. The water cascades forcefully down the rock face, creating white splashes and frothy patterns against the textured surface. The focus is entirely on the powerful, natural action of the falling water and the immersive atmosphere it creates. The deep focus used keeps the entire scene sharp, accentuating the dynamic view of the waterfall. The water splashes into a brilliant white spray and countless individual droplets that stand out against the shadowy background, adding depth and texture to the scene. The bright green foliage on the right adds a vibrant contrast to the scene, enhancing the visual composition. The outdoor, daytime setting further highlights the natural beauty of the waterfall, with the distinct dark veining on the rocks adding texture and contrast to the overall scene.",

    "Scene": "In an outdoor, daytime setting, water cascades down a light-colored rock face with distinct dark veining. The falling water creates white splashes and frothy patterns against the textured surface. On the right side of the scene, patches of bright green foliage grow on the rocks, adding a touch of color. As the camera tilts down, the background turns dark, highlighting the countless individual droplets at the center of the frame, emphasizing the continuous downward motion of the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
