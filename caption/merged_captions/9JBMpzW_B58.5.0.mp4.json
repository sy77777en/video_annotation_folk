  "merged_caption": "This video showcases an extreme wide shot of a seascape captured from a level-angle perspective on a moving container ship. The ship's deck, filled with containers, occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The ocean fills the horizontal center of the scene, stretching from the middle ground to the background horizon. The sky populates the top half of the frame in the background, where dark clouds are seen in a time-lapse moving rapidly across the stationary stars. A yellow glow is positioned on the right side of the frame along the background horizon, while a green airglow is visible in the upper left of the sky. The camera, mounted on the cargo ship, subtly moves forward with the ship's progression and slightly pans to the right, capturing the night sky filled with stars and passing clouds. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to curve slightly outward. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the ship's cargo to the starry sky sharp and clear. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment, making the atmosphere the primary focus rather than a specific subject. The foreground is occupied by rows of shipping containers, leading the eye out towards the vast, dark ocean that meets a star-filled sky. Dark clouds drift rapidly across the celestial expanse, which is illuminated by a bright yellow glow on the distant horizon and a subtle green airglow, creating a breathtaking and dynamic nocturnal scene. Overlays on the right side of the screen display the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram logo and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube logo.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a camera mounted on a cargo ship, which moves forward as the ship advances. The subtle movement in the dark environment is difficult to discern but includes a slight pan to the right. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to curve slightly outward. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the ship's cargo to the starry sky sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse seascape captured at night from the bow of a large container ship. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment, making the atmosphere the primary focus rather than a specific subject. The foreground is occupied by rows of shipping containers, leading the eye out towards the vast, dark ocean that meets a star-filled sky. Dark clouds drift rapidly across the celestial expanse, which is illuminated by a bright yellow glow on the distant horizon and a subtle green airglow, creating a breathtaking and dynamic nocturnal scene.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video from the perspective of a container ship at sea. The camera captures the night sky, filled with stars and passing clouds. A yellow glow illuminates the horizon in the distance.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on a container ship at sea, a time-lapse captures the night sky. A vast expanse of stars is visible between dark, fast-moving clouds. A bright yellow glow illuminates the horizon on the right, while a faint greenish hue is present in the upper left sky. In the foreground, the deck of the ship is laden with rows of shipping containers. The dark ocean stretches out ahead toward the horizon. Overlays on the right side of the screen display the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram logo and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube logo.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
