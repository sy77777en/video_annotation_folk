  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a dark-skinned man with a goatee, wearing a brown fedora hat with a black band, dark sunglasses, and a rust-colored collared shirt or jacket. He is consistently positioned in the center foreground, holding a metal object that conforms to the shape of his hand near the left side of his face. The camera is at the subject's level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in focus. A double dolly technique is employed: the man maintains his fixed size and central position within the frame through synchronized movement, moving forward as the camera moves backward. As a result, the background elements—an urban street extending from the center, flanked by multi-story brownstone-style buildings in the left and right background, trees with green foliage in the left and right middle ground to background, a dark, possibly wrought-iron fence in the left middle ground, and parked cars, including a maroon sedan in the left middle ground and another vehicle further down the street on the right—continuously move past him. This creates a dynamic visual effect where the surrounding environment appears to flow around the subject, who remains the central focus. Throughout the clip, his lips exhibit slight movements, more consistent with chewing than speaking. The scene is set on a sunlit urban street, and a text overlay is visible in the bottom center foreground, displaying white text: \"First Double Dolly: Mo Better Blues (1990)\".",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. It executes a dolly-back movement, smoothly matching the pace of the man's forward movement.",
    "Subject": "A dark-skinned man with a goatee is shown from the chest up, facing forward. He wears a brown fedora hat with a black band, dark sunglasses, and a rust-colored collared shirt or jacket. He holds a metal object that conforms to the shape of his hand in his left hand, close to his face.",
    "Motion": "The man, viewed from the chest up, maintains a relatively static position, looking directly at the camera. He holds a metallic object in his left hand, positioned near the left side of his face. Throughout the clip, his lips exhibit slight movements, more consistent with chewing than speaking.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a sunlit urban street, lined with multi-story brownstone-style buildings on both sides. Trees with green foliage are also present on either side of the street. A dark, possibly wrought-iron fence is visible in the middle ground on the left. Parked cars, including a maroon sedan on the left and another vehicle further down the street on the right, are present. The camera appears to be moving backward along the sidewalk. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text: \"First Double Dolly: Mo Better Blues (1990)\".",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, who is consistently positioned in the center foreground, holding a metal object near his face, also in the center foreground. The camera is at the subject's level.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
