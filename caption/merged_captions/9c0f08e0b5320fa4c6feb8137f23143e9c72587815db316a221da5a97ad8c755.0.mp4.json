  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young Black man with short, black, twisted hair is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground as he plays a black electronic keyboard located in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. He is wearing a short-sleeved, dark blue button-up shirt open over a gray t-shirt, along with light brown pants, and a black beaded bracelet is visible on his right wrist. The scene is set indoors, with the individual seated on a simple wooden stool. In the background, a light-colored wall features a textured, mottled pattern of gray and white. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a deep focus and smoothly dollies forward, moving closer to the musician, causing the framing to tighten slightly on the man. As the video progresses, his hands move across the white and black keys of the instrument. He alternates between looking down at his hands as they play and briefly lifting his gaze to look forward before returning his focus to the keyboard. At the conclusion of the sequence, he raises his gaze once more to look forward.",

    "Motion": "A young man sits and plays an electronic keyboard, his hands moving across the white and black keys. He looks down at his hands as they play, then briefly lifts his gaze to look forward before returning his focus to the keyboard. At the conclusion of the sequence, he raises his gaze once more to look forward.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, where a person plays a black electronic keyboard. The individual is seated on a simple wooden stool.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
