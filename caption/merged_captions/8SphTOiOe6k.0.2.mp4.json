  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a street scene in a quaint Japanese town, captured from a first-person POV at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus throughout. In the foreground, on the left side, a group of people, including two individuals in black outfits and a woman in a beige coat, walk along the sidewalk, positioned in the middle ground as they move towards the background. The camera smoothly pans from left to right, capturing the lively street scene lined with traditional wooden buildings showcasing a blend of modern and classic architecture. The time of day is clear and sunny, with a bright blue sky and scattered clouds. On the right side, a red car drives past in the middle ground, while a black car is parked in the driveway in the foreground/middle ground. As the video progresses, another black car enters from the right and moves towards the foreground. The camera continues to pan right, revealing more of the street and the buildings, including a shop with a sign in Japanese and a small shop with an orange board and a 'KIRIN' sign. A rickshaw pulled by a person wearing a traditional hat and mask appears, moving from the right side of the frame to the left, passing by more buildings and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The street is moderately busy, featuring pedestrians in casual attire, some carrying bags, and cars moving along the road. The environment is vibrant, with green foliage and colorful autumn leaves adding to the picturesque atmosphere. Near the end, the camera moves slightly forward as the cameraman walks, maintaining steadiness, and the video concludes with the rickshaw moving out of the frame and a black car driving down the street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
