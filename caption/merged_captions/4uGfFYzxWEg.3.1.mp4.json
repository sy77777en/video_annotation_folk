  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up side view of three people in a dimly lit television production control room. A woman with short, blonde hair occupies the left side of the frame, operating a large mixing console fitted with numerous illuminated buttons and faders at the bottom. Two other women are seated to her left in the middle ground, extending towards the center, with white papers in front of them. In the background on the right, a wall of CRT monitors displays various camera feeds. The handheld camera, positioned at approximately the seated subjects' height, rapidly zooms in while panning right and tilting slightly upward, moving towards the monitor wall. This movement shifts the focus entirely to the screens, which come to fill the frame. In the final composition, two large monitors are centered: the one on the left displays a wide shot of a brightly lit game show set with a circular stage, lit with blue and purple lights, while the one on the right shows a medium-full shot of a middle-aged man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark trousers, standing with his hands on his hips against a purple, patterned backdrop. Smaller monitors are positioned above and below them, showing different angles of the production. A white text overlay in the bottom left corner reads, \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - The Making Of Millionaire (2017)\". The video appears to be in deep focus, though the low resolution makes it difficult to confirm. All individuals in the control room are focused on the large bank of monitors, which display footage from the game show, including the man delivering a speech on stage.",

    "Subject": "In a dimly lit control room, a woman with short, blonde hair, seen from the side, operates a large mixing console. To her left, further from the camera, there are two women sitting at a desk with white papers in front of them. They are all focused on a large bank of monitors. As the view moves closer to the screens, one large monitor displays a wide shot of a brightly lit game show set with a circular stage, while another screen shows a medium-full shot of a middle-aged man with short, light-colored hair. He is wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark trousers, standing with his hands on his hips against a purple, patterned backdrop.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark television production control room, where several people are seated at a long blue console. The console is fitted with a large mixing board featuring numerous illuminated buttons and faders. In front of them, a wall of CRT monitors displays various camera feeds. A large central monitor shows a wide view of a game show set, which has a circular stage and is lit with blue and purple lights. An adjacent large screen shows a man standing against a purple, textured background. Other smaller monitors show different angles of the production. On the desk, there are papers and a microphone. A white text overlay in the bottom left corner reads, \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - The Making Of Millionaire (2017)\".",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up side view of three people in a control room. A woman in the foreground occupies the left side of the frame, operating a console at the bottom. Two other people are seated to her left in the middle ground, extending towards the center. In the background on the right, a wall of monitors is visible. The handheld camera rapidly zooms in while panning right and tilting slightly upward, moving towards the monitor wall.

In the final composition, two large monitors are centered: the one on the left displays a wide shot of a game show set, and the one on the right shows a man standing.

The camera is positioned at approximately the seated subjects' height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
