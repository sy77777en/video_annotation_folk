  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a vast icy landscape, captured from an aerial perspective. The scene is composed of large, irregularly shaped icebergs positioned primarily in the center and top of the frame, with dark water surrounding them. The icebergs occupy the foreground and middle ground, while the water extends into the background. The camera maintains a high angle, looking down at the scene, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the environment. The shot remains steady, with no noticeable changes in framing or camera position, allowing the viewer to take in the expansive and serene icy setting. The video shows a stunning aerial view of icebergs floating in dark water. The icebergs are white with a hint of blue, and there are numerous small dark shapes on one of the icebergs, possibly animals. The water around the icebergs is a deep, contrasting color, with areas where the seawater appears green, adding to the visual complexity and enhancing the impact of the scene. The video is an aerial landscape scenery shot focusing on a vast expanse of icebergs floating in dark water, with creatures, likely penguins, scattered across the icebergs. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the contrast between the bright white ice and the deep, dark water, while also highlighting the beautiful blue-green hue of the sea near the icebergs. The icebergs have irregular shapes, with some featuring smooth surfaces and others having jagged edges. The water appears calm, with a rich, dark hue that accentuates the ice's stark whiteness. The video captures the scale and majesty of the natural setting, rather than focusing on a specific object, creating a sense of vastness and isolation.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the ground. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing all elements sharply. The camera moves forward smoothly without any shaking, focusing on the icebergs and the seals on them.",

    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a vast, icy landscape. The setting is outdoors, featuring large, white ice formations surrounded by dark, cold water. The layered folds on the ice surface reveal subtle undulations in elevation, and its surface is dotted with numerous small, dark shapes, likely animals, scattered across the expanse. The water is a deep, almost black hue, contrasting sharply with the bright ice. Patches of turquoise water are visible in areas where the ice has melted, adding a striking color contrast. The scene is likely set during daylight, as the ice and water are clearly visible. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the icy environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
