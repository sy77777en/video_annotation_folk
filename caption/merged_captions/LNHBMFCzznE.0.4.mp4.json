  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a light-skinned, middle-aged woman with short, dark brown hair in a bob style, standing in the center of the frame on a stage. She is wearing a sleeveless, knee-length black dress and black mid-calf boots, positioned on a square red rug located at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a large screen displaying the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo is visible in the top right. To the top left, a smaller screen shows a live feed of the speaker. Below this smaller screen, a large \"TEDx Vancouver\" sign is positioned in the background on the left side of the stage. The entire backdrop consists of a geometrically patterned wall lit in blue. The camera starts from a high angle looking down at the speaker on stage, smoothly moving down while tilting up, transitioning to a level, eye-level perspective. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire stage and background sharp. The woman stands on the red rug, gesturing with her hands as she speaks. She takes a small step to her right with her left leg and continues to gesture with both hands. The scene is set on the stage of a TEDx Vancouver event, with the \"TEDx\" portion of the logo in red and \"Vancouver\" constructed from large, white letters. On the right side of the stage, a cluster of cylindrical white objects is positioned. The overall lighting is theatrical, focusing on the stage and leaving the surrounding area in darkness.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set on the stage of a TEDx Vancouver event. A woman stands in the center of a square red rug, which is placed on a dark, raised platform. Behind her, two separate screens are visible: the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo is displayed on a large screen at the top right, while a live feed of her presentation is shown on another screen at the top left. The backdrop is a large, geometrically faceted wall illuminated with a deep blue light. To the left of the stage, the \"TEDx\" portion of the logo is in red, while \"Vancouver\" is constructed from large, white letters. On the right side of the stage, a cluster of cylindrical white objects is positioned. The overall lighting is theatrical, focusing on the stage and leaving the surrounding area in darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
