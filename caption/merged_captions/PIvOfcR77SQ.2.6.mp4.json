  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy landscape, capturing the expansive environment. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the scene, where several small, round structures with conical roofs, possibly yurts, are positioned in the middle ground, slightly towards the left. These structures are surrounded by numerous bare, leafless trees scattered across the flat terrain, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. The ground is blanketed with thick, undisturbed snow, creating a smooth, white expanse. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, smoothly pans to the right with minimal shaking, revealing more of the snowy terrain and additional trees. As the camera continues to move, a red wooden cabin with a snow-covered roof comes into view on the right side of the frame. This cabin is located in the midground, and its vibrant color contrasts sharply with the white snow. The camera further pans right, showing more of the red house and a small section of another wooden structure in the foreground on the right of the frame, constructed with horizontal wooden planks. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at eye-level to capture the full breadth of the snowy expanse and the structures within it. The sky remains overcast, forming the backdrop of the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height, ensuring a continuous and steady view of the serene winter landscape. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the snowy environment. The wide view captures the overall ambiance and natural beauty of the scene, highlighting the atmosphere and scale of the winter setting rather than any specific object.",

    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive snowy environment, highlighting the atmosphere and scale of the winter setting rather than any specific object. The wide view captures the overall ambiance and natural beauty of the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a snowy landscape featuring three white yurts and several leafless trees scattered around. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the snowy terrain and additional trees. As the camera continues to move, a red house with a snow-covered roof comes into view on the right side of the frame.

    "Scene": "The video captures a serene winter landscape in an outdoor rural setting, likely during the daytime under overcast skies. The ground is blanketed with thick, undisturbed snow, creating a smooth, white expanse. The camera pans to the right, transitioning from several small, round structures with conical roofs, possibly yurts, surrounded by sparse, leafless trees, to a red wooden cabin in the midground. The trees are tall and slender, adding vertical elements to the otherwise flat terrain. The vibrant color of the cabin contrasts with the snow, and its walls are made of vertical wooden planks. In the foreground on the right side of the frame, a small section of another wooden structure is visible, constructed with horizontal wooden planks. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the snowy environment.",

These structures are surrounded by numerous bare trees scattered across the flat terrain, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. As the camera pans to the right, the perspective shifts, bringing a red wooden cabin into the center of the frame when the camera stops panning. This cabin is located in the midground, and its vibrant color contrasts sharply with the white snow. A small section of another wooden structure becomes visible in the foreground on the right of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
