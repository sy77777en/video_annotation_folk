  "merged_caption": "This video starts with a medium close-up shot of the back of a man with neatly styled, reddish-brown hair, positioned in the center foreground. He is wearing a dark blue suit jacket over a white collared shirt and large, vintage-style black headphones with metallic components. The camera is at eye level, focusing on him with a shallow depth of field, making the background—a dimly lit hall—initially very blurry. At the beginning, the man's head is slightly tilted to the right. As the camera smoothly moves forward while simultaneously zooming out, creating a dramatic Dolly Zoom effect, the shot transitions into a close-up that frames his head and the top of his shoulders. During this movement, he turns his head towards the left, followed by a slight turn back towards the right, and finally maintains a position with his head slightly tilted to the left, looking forward. Throughout this sequence, he remains in the center of the frame. As the camera advances, the background becomes slightly more discernible, revealing a large, dimly lit hall with numerous audience members behind him, surrounded by scattered points of light in a dark, cavernous environment, but it stays out of focus.",

    "Scene": "The camera starts with a focus on the back of a man in the foreground, smoothly moving forward while zooming out. He has reddish-brown, styled hair and wears a dark blue suit jacket over a white collared shirt, along with large, vintage-style headphones. Initially, the shallow depth of field makes the background very blurry, but as the camera zooms out, it becomes faintly discernible that he is in a large, dimly lit hall with numerous audience members behind him, surrounded by scattered points of light in a dark, cavernous environment.",
    "Spatial": "This video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man from behind, who is positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a dimly lit and out-of-focus hall is visible. The camera then slowly moves closer to the man, transitioning the shot into a close-up that frames his head and the top of his shoulders. Throughout this movement, he remains in the center of the frame. As the camera advances, the background, revealing a large hall with an audience, becomes slightly more discernible but stays out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
