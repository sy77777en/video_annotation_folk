  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, begins with a football player in a yellow jersey with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and a black helmet holding the ball in the left middle ground, running toward the right. A second player in a similar uniform runs in the center-right middle ground, while a referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands in the center-left middle ground. A tall, yellow goalpost is positioned on the far left, and a dense crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background. As the slightly unsteady, eye-level camera pans and trucks to the right, following the football players as they advance down the grey turf field with white yard lines, the player with the ball moves toward the center of the frame, and the goalpost exits the shot on the left. Simultaneously, a group of players in blue and white uniforms enters from the right, tackling another group of players in yellow and black in the middle ground. The referee stands nearby, observing the action. The background features stadium seating filled with a dense crowd of spectators, creating a sea of color. A low, grey concrete wall separates the field from the stands. The deep focus keeps both the players in the middle ground and the crowd in the background sharp throughout the pan.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, eye-level shot maintains a level angle. The camera pans and trucks to the right, following the football players as they advance down the field. A deep focus is used, keeping both the players in the middle ground and the crowd in the background sharp.",
    "Subject": "On a green football field, a player in a yellow jersey with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and a black helmet runs with a football. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands observing. Several other players in blue and white uniforms are also on the field, some involved in a tackle. Additionally, there are several players wearing yellow jerseys with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and black helmets. A large crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background stands.",
    "Motion": "Two football players in yellow and black uniforms sprint from left to right, moving towards a group involved in a tackle. In the middle ground, several players in blue and white uniforms are tackling other players in yellow and black. A referee stands nearby, observing the action. The background is filled with spectators in the stands.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a large American football stadium, viewed from a sideline perspective. The playing surface is a grey turf field with white yard lines, including the 20-yard line, clearly visible. On the left side of the scene, a tall, yellow goalpost stands in the end zone and goes out of view as the camera pans from left to right. The background features stadium seating filled with a dense crowd of spectators, the majority of whom are wearing yellow, creating a sea of color. A low, grey concrete wall separates the field from the stands. Several football players in uniforms are on the field, and a referee in a striped shirt stands near the sideline.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, begins with a football player holding the ball in the left middle ground, running toward the right. A second player in a similar uniform runs in the center-right middle ground, while a referee stands in the center-left middle ground. A tall, yellow goalpost is positioned on the far left, and a dense crowd fills the background. As the camera pans from left to right to follow the action, the player with the ball moves toward the center of the frame, and the goalpost exits the shot on the left. Simultaneously, a group of players in blue and white uniforms enters from the right, tackling another group of players in the middle ground. The crowd remains consistently in the background throughout the pan."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
