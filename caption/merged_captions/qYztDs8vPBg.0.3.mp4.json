  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a pair of neutral-skinned hands occupies the center foreground, holding a broken white cable against a plain white background. The left hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the right hand is on the right. The fingers of both hands manipulate the two frayed ends of the cable at the very center of the frame, twisting them slightly to reveal the internal components. The left hand holds the entire bundle of charging cables, revealing the cross-section of one cut end. Meanwhile, the thumb and index finger of each hand pinch the other cut end to emphasize it, pulling back the braided outer layer to expose the torn inner insulation and the copper wires at the core. The left hand holds the end of the cable relatively still while the other hand rotates the damaged section for inspection. The outer fabric sheath is frayed and pulled back from the break, revealing the inner white plastic insulation, which is also torn. The hands are positioned to display the damage up close. This is a static, close-up shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the frayed white cable in the foreground and the tips of the index and thumb fingers of the hands holding the cable.",

    "Scene": "In an extreme close-up view, a pair of hands holds a broken white cable against a plain white background. The cable features a braided, textured sheathing that is frayed and torn at the break. The fingers manipulate the two separated ends, revealing the white fibers of the outer layer and the small inner wires.",

The left hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the right hand is on the right. The fingers of both hands manipulate the two frayed ends of the cable at the very center of the frame, twisting them slightly to reveal the internal components against a blurred white background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
