  "merged_caption": "A full shot shows a young, light-skinned woman with long, wet, blonde hair in the center middle ground, initially leaning forward while standing on a yellow surfboard that occupies the bottom center of the frame. She is wearing a yellow bikini and is smiling. The camera, mounted on the surfboard, is positioned above the water at a level angle, capturing a locked-on POV shot with mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle caused by the camera rolling. A city skyline with numerous tall, modern hotel buildings lines a sandy beach in the background, stretching across the frame from left to right under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp as the surfboard moves through turquoise ocean water, with white splashes and spray frequently obscuring the view. Initially, the woman stands with her arms hanging down, and as the surfboard glides through the water, she lowers her body and sits down on the board, moving vertically downward to a seated position while remaining in the center of the frame. The slightly unsteady camera dips into the water and rolls as the surfer transitions from standing to sitting, maintaining a level-angle perspective that moves with the board through the water.",

    "Camera": "This shot features mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned above the water at a level angle, with a varying Dutch angle caused by the camera rolling. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. Mounted on the surfboard, the slightly unsteady camera dips into the water and rolls as the surfer transitions from standing to sitting.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned woman with long, wet, blonde hair is shown on a yellow surfboard in the water. She is wearing a yellow bikini and is smiling. The video captures her from a level angle with a locked-on perspective, as the camera remains fixed on the surfboard. Initially, she leans forward while standing with her arms hanging down, and then she sits down on the board.",
    "Motion": "A woman, initially standing and leaning forward on a moving surfboard with her hands hanging freely, lowers her body and sits down on the board as it glides through the water.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a yellow surfboard shows it moving through turquoise ocean water. In the background, a city skyline with numerous tall, modern hotel buildings lines a sandy beach under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The camera, fixed to the board, captures the movement through the water, with white splashes and spray frequently obscuring the view as a person on the board leans forward while standing and then transitions to a seated position.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot shows a woman in the center middle ground, initially leaning forward while standing on a yellow surfboard that occupies the bottom center of the frame. A city skyline is visible in the background, stretching across the frame from left to right. The woman then moves vertically downward to a seated position, remaining in the center of the frame. The camera is fixed to the front of the surfboard, providing a level-angle perspective that moves with the board through the water."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
