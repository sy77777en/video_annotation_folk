  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up, a person's eye is positioned in the right foreground of the static frame, with long eyelashes clearly visible. The eye, wide and light brown, intently looks into the eyepiece of an optical instrument on the left. The instrument is dark and cylindrical, with a ridged, out-of-focus section that has a warm, golden hue. A few strands of light brown or blonde hair are visible near the person's temple. The background is entirely dark, and the scene is dimly lit with warm, directional light highlighting the side of the person's face. The camera is positioned at the subject's level in an eye-level, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the person's eye. The camera is slightly unsteady, and the person's head shakes slightly, making the optical instrument appear unsteady as well. Despite this, their eye remains focused and intently gazes into the eyepiece. The tight framing makes any broader movement unclear.",

    "Subject": "In an extreme close-up, a person with light skin and a brown eye looks intently into the eyepiece of an optical instrument. Their eye is wide, and their long eyelashes are clearly visible. A few strands of light brown or blonde hair are visible near their temple. The out-of-focus instrument they are looking through is dark with a golden, ribbed section near the person's eye. The scene is dimly lit with warm light highlighting the side of the person's face.",
    "Motion": "The person's head shakes slightly, and the optical instrument appears unsteady, yet their eye remains focused and intently gazes into the eyepiece.",
    "Scene": "In an extremely close-up shot set against a black background, a person's light brown eye is visible on the right. The eye, framed by long lashes, is looking through the eyepiece of an instrument on the left. The instrument is dark and cylindrical, with a ridged, out-of-focus section that has a warm, golden hue. A small amount of light-colored, curly hair is visible above the person's brow. The scene is illuminated by warm, directional light.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme close-up, a person's eye is positioned in the right foreground of the static frame. To the left, the out-of-focus eyepiece of an instrument occupies the foreground. The background is entirely dark. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
