  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a seal positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame in this 2D, black and white pencil sketch animation. The seal is light-colored with large, dark eyes, an open mouth, and prominent whiskers, floating on its back and facing upward towards the camera. In the background, multiple horizontal rows of stylized, glowing lotus flowers occupy the top half of the scene, creating a whimsical, monochromatic setting with a surreal, artistic style. The environment is calm and imaginative, with a focus on playful, cartoon-like creatures. The stop-motion video features smooth rightward camera movement, tracking the playful scene with animated characters. The seal opens its mouth as if speaking or singing and begins to move to the right, performing a somersault into the water. As the seal continues, a procession of black and white penguins with open beaks enters from the right side of the frame, moving left across the middle ground, positioned behind the seal. The penguins stand on small, blocky platforms, seemingly dancing, adding to the imaginative landscape. As they pass, the seal, remaining in its foreground position, raises its flippers. The penguins continue moving left until they exit the frame, after which the seal also disappears from the bottom. The scene then transitions to a view of three light-colored, cartoonish elephant-like creatures standing in a row, occupying the center of the frame in the foreground, with the lotus flower pattern still visible in the background. Each elephant stands on its hind legs in a dancing pose with trunks raised, facing towards the right, and waving their trunks in a synchronized manner. The camera perspective for the elephants appears to be at their eye level.",

    "Subject": "In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a light-colored seal with large, dark eyes and an open mouth floats on its back, facing upward towards the camera. It has prominent whiskers and at one point raises its flippers. A procession of black and white penguins with open beaks stands on small, blocky platforms. A line of three light-colored, cartoonish elephants also appears, standing on their hind legs in a dancing pose with their trunks raised. The background is composed of repeating horizontal rows of stylized, glowing lotus flowers.",
    "Motion": "A seal-like creature is seen lying on its back, swimming with its head turned towards the camera, while lotus flowers are positioned behind it. The seal opens its mouth as if speaking or singing and begins to move to the right, performing a somersault into the water. As the seal continues, three penguin-like creatures appear in the middle ground, standing on an ice block and seemingly dancing. The scene then transitions to three cartoonish elephant-like creatures, who are standing upright, facing towards the right, and waving their trunks in a synchronized manner.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a whimsical, monochromatic scene with a surreal, artistic style. The setting is outdoors, featuring a backdrop of stylized lotus flowers floating on water. The environment is calm and imaginative, with a focus on playful, cartoon-like creatures. In the first part, a seal-like creature is depicted with a textured, sketch-like appearance, swimming in the water. In the latter part, three elephant-like figures stand in a row, each with exaggerated features and a similar sketchy texture. Additionally, penguins are shown standing on ice blocks, adding to the imaginative landscape. The overall composition is characterized by its black-and-white color scheme and the creative, dreamlike quality of the characters and setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
