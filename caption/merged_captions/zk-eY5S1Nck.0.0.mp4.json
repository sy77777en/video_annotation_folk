  "merged_caption": "The shot opens with the right side of the frame entirely blacked out by a foreground obstruction, showing only a sliver of a room on the far right. The camera, from a smooth, hip-level perspective, moves forward and to the left, gradually revealing a young girl in a full shot, sitting motionless on the carpeted floor in the middle ground. She is wearing a pink short-sleeved shirt under blue denim overalls and purple shoes, with blonde hair styled in two pigtails. The girl holds a grey, round stuffed toy in her lap and is surrounded by other plush toys, including a large stuffed lion to her right and slightly backward, and a yellow dog-like toy to her left. In the final framing, she is positioned in the center-left of the visible space. A dark piece of furniture sits in the background behind her, holding a picture frame and other small items. The low-key lighting casts deep shadows throughout the dimly lit child's bedroom, creating a quiet and somber atmosphere. The girl looks up and toward the right with a neutral, watchful expression. The foreground obstruction continues to cover the right portion of the frame, and the camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the girl in the midground in focus.",

    "Motion": "The view pans from right to left from behind an obstruction, gradually revealing a young girl sitting motionless on a carpeted floor. Surrounded by stuffed toys, she holds one in her lap and looks straight ahead and upward.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit child's bedroom, viewed from a partially obscured vantage point that blacks out both the right and left sides of the frame. A young girl sits on the carpeted floor, surrounded by several large stuffed animals, including a prominent lion. In the background, a dark piece of furniture holds a picture frame and other small items. The low-key lighting casts deep shadows throughout the room, creating a quiet and somber atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
