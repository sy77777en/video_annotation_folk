  "merged_caption": "In a bird's-eye view, a multi-lane asphalt road extends horizontally across the center of the frame, cutting through a barren, sandy landscape during the day. The road is marked with white dashed lines and a central double yellow line. A convoy of six vehicles occupies the middle ground on the road, including a large semi-trailer truck with a dark cab and a long, white, rectangular trailer positioned in the center of the frame. This truck is escorted by five smaller, olive-green, military-style vehicles, with three located to the left of the truck and two to its right, all arranged in a staggered formation. The vehicles travel forward in unison, maintaining a constant speed and a fixed formation as they proceed through the desert landscape. Bright blue, zig-zagging lines of energy connect all the vehicles, forming a web-like pattern that spans horizontally across the central portion of the frame, linking each military truck to the others and to the semi-truck. The camera, from a high, bird's-eye perspective, quickly and smoothly moves up and to the left, tracking the convoy on the desert road. As the camera pulls away, the vehicles become smaller in the frame, with motion blur emphasizing the speed and movement, causing the surrounding desert terrain to appear blurred while keeping the focus on the cars and the road. The vehicles cast dark shadows on the pavement, and the network of bright blue, lightning-like energy beams zig-zags between them across the lanes, enhancing the dynamic visual composition of the scene.",

    "Subject": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a convoy of vehicles travels along a paved road. In the center of the formation is a large semi-trailer truck with a dark cab and a long, white, rectangular trailer. This truck is escorted by five smaller, olive-green, military-style vehicles, with three positioned in front and two behind. A network of bright blue, crackling lines of energy connects all six vehicles, linking each military truck to the others and to the semi-truck, forming a web-like pattern over the convoy.",
    "Motion": "From a top-down perspective, a convoy of six vehicles, including a central semi-truck and five escort vehicles, travels forward in unison along a straight road. The vehicles maintain a constant speed and a fixed formation as they proceed through a desert landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a multi-lane asphalt road cutting through a barren, sandy landscape during the day. The road is marked with white dashed lines and a central double yellow line. Several military-green vehicles and a white semi-trailer truck are positioned on the road, casting dark shadows on the pavement. A network of bright blue, lightning-like energy beams connects all the vehicles, zig-zagging between them across the lanes.",
    "Spatial": "In a bird's-eye view, a multi-lane road extends horizontally across the center of the frame, with a sandy landscape visible at the top and bottom. A convoy of vehicles occupies the middle ground on the road. A large semi-truck with a white trailer is positioned in the center of the frame. It is escorted by five smaller, military-style vehicles, also in the middle ground, with three located to the left of the truck and two to its right, all arranged in a staggered formation. Bright blue, zig-zagging lines connect all the vehicles, forming a web-like pattern that spans horizontally across the central portion of the frame. The camera moves upward and to the left, causing the vehicles to appear smaller within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
