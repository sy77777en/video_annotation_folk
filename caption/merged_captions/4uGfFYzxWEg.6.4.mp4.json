  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a smooth, forward and downward camera movement towards a low-polygon animated figure of a man, captured at eye level. This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The figure is depicted from the chest up, composed of flat, geometric shapes in shades of beige and light brown, wearing what appears to be a collared shirt. He holds a dark, old-style mobile phone or receiver to his left ear with his left hand, while his right hand is extended forward with an open palm, moving slightly in a gesturing motion. The final framing is cropped between the subject's chest and waist, with the left arm in the foreground becoming out of focus due to its proximity to the camera, while the focus remains sharp on the subject's torso. The figure is oriented slightly toward his left, which is the right side of the frame. In the background, a horizontal row of glowing white ovals stretches across the frame, resembling a sound wave display. The indoor setting features a dark, textured background. Overlay elements include white text in the bottom left corner reading \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003),\" and white subtitles at the bottom center of the screen displaying the words \"during the taping of the show in which you participated.\" Additionally, text at the bottom of the screen displays the words: \"Oh good lord, no.\"",

    "Subject": "A low-polygon, 3D-rendered figure of a man is depicted from the chest up. The figure is composed of flat, geometric shapes in shades of beige and light brown and is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt. He holds a dark, old-style mobile phone or receiver to his left ear with his left hand. His right hand is extended forward with an open palm, as if gesturing while speaking. The figure is oriented slightly toward his left, which is the right side of the frame.",
    "Motion": "A low-polygon figure of a man holds a phone to his ear with his left hand. His right hand, held out in front of him with an open palm, moves slightly in a gesturing motion. The rest of his body remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with a dark, textured background, a row of glowing, white, vertical ovals is visible, resembling a sound wave display. A central, low-poly, geometric figure rendered in a golden-brown color is depicted holding an object to its ear. The scene includes overlay elements: in the bottom left corner, white text reads \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003),\" and white subtitles at the bottom of the screen display the words \"during the taping of the show in which you participated.\" Additionally, text at the bottom of the screen displays the words: \"Oh good lord, no.\"",

The left arm in the foreground becomes out of focus due to its proximity to the camera, while the focus remains sharp on the subject's torso.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
