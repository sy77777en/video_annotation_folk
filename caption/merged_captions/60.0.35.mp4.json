  "merged_caption": "In a low-angle full shot, two young women are positioned in the foreground on a metal grid fence under a clear blue sky. The woman in the yellow t-shirt, black pants, white sneakers, and a black cap sits atop the fence on the left side of the frame, while the woman in the red long-sleeved crop top, black and white patterned pants, and a bright yellow backpack sits atop the fence on the right. The fence and the women together form the foreground. In the background, a single thin, dark pole is visible to the left of the center, and the top of a tree becomes visible to the lower left of the pole behind the fence. The two women reach their hands toward the center of the frame to interact in a hand slap gesture, during which the woman in the yellow shirt lifts her right leg. From a smooth, low-angle perspective, the camera arcs slightly counterclockwise around the two people at the fence, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, with the camera height appearing to be below knee-level, though the exact height is difficult to determine as the ground is not visible. As the camera moves, the top of the tree becomes more prominent in the lower left of the frame.",

    "Subject": "Two young women interact on a metal grid fence under a clear blue sky. The woman on the right, with long, curly dark hair, sits atop the fence, wearing a red long-sleeved crop top, black and white patterned pants, and a bright yellow backpack. To her left, another woman with long, dark hair climbs over the fence. She is wearing a yellow t-shirt, black pants, white sneakers, and a black cap. They are reaching their hands toward one another in a hand slap gesture.",
    "Motion": "Two women are seated on a metal grid fence. They lean towards each other and perform a hand slap, during which the woman in the yellow shirt lifts her right leg.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is captured from a low angle during the daytime, looking up towards a clear, light blue sky. The central feature is a tall, metallic fence with a grid pattern, which extends across the view. Two people are interacting at the top of this fence. The individual wearing a red top, patterned pants, and a bright yellow backpack is positioned on the right side, straddling the top rail. The person in a yellow shirt and black pants is on the left side. In the background, a single thin, dark pole is visible against the sky, and as the camera moves, the top of a tree becomes visible to the lower left of the pole behind the fence.",
    "Spatial": "In a low-angle full shot, two women are positioned in the foreground on a metal grid fence. The woman in the yellow shirt sits atop the fence on the left side of the frame, while the woman in the red shirt sits atop the fence on the right. The fence and the women together form the foreground. In the background, a clear blue sky fills the upper half of the frame, with a single thin pole visible to the left of the center and the top of a tree visible to the lower left of the pole. The two women reach their hands toward the center of the frame to interact as the camera makes a slight arc counterclockwise."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
