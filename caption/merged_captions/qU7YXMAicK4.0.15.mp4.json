  "merged_caption": "A full shot centers on a giant orange pumpkin with deep horizontal ribs in the middle ground, which rests on a wooden platform occupying the bottom portion of the frame. In the foreground, a dark green baseball cap with a circular logo on its front is positioned at the bottom center-right, at the base of the pumpkin. White fabric walls are visible in the background and middle ground, framing the pumpkin on the left, right, and top. In the bottom left, concrete blocks are visible in the middle ground under the fabric. The camera is positioned at the pumpkin's level, and the shot remains static. This is a time-lapse video, played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, showing the giant pumpkin that appears to grow slightly larger, with subtle movements in the surrounding environment, despite the camera remaining static. The shot is completely static, filmed from a hip-level, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the pumpkin and its surroundings sharp.",

    "Subject": "A very large, round, orange pumpkin with deep horizontal ribs is shown in a full view. The giant pumpkin rests on a flat wooden surface. In the foreground, at the base of the pumpkin, sits a dark green baseball cap with a circular logo on its front.",
    "Motion": "The video features a time-lapse of a giant pumpkin that appears to grow slightly larger, with subtle movements in the surrounding environment, despite the camera remaining static.",
    "Scene": "A large, round, orange pumpkin with deep horizontal ridges is positioned on a platform made of wooden planks. The scene is set within an enclosed area defined by white fabric walls draped in both the middleground and background. In the foreground, a dark green cap with an orange circular logo rests on the wooden platform at the base of the pumpkin. To the left, multiple concrete blocks are visible supporting the structure beneath the white fabric.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
