  "merged_caption": "A bright cyan light source is positioned at the top center of the frame, casting a vibrant blue hue against a dark, deep-blue background. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light originate from various points and move in different directions, covering the width of the scene. Scattered throughout the entire space are countless small, sparkling blue particles that either float independently or are attached to the middle of the vertical streaks, creating a sense of depth and a dynamic, shimmering effect. These particles, along with the streaks, drift irregularly, creating a dynamic effect of cascading light. The continuous motion of these glowing elements enhances the abstract visual, though the video does not provide enough information to confirm whether the camera is static or if there is any movement.",

    "Subject": "This abstract video showcases a cascade of luminous blue elements against a dark background. From a bright, cyan-colored glow at the top of the scene, numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light move in various directions. Scattered throughout the space are countless small, sparkling particles of light, also blue, that either float independently or are attached to the middle of the vertical streaks, creating a sense of depth and a dynamic, shimmering effect.",
    "Motion": "Thin, vertical streaks of blue light and smaller, sparkling particles move and float in various directions irregularly, creating a dynamic effect of cascading light against a dark background.",
    "Scene": "Against a dark, deep-blue background, a radiant light source glows at the top center, casting a vibrant blue hue. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of light and a cascade of small, sparkling particles drift in different directions. The continuous motion of these glowing elements creates a dynamic and abstract visual.",
    "Spatial": "A bright cyan light source is positioned at the top center of the frame. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light originate from various points and move in different directions, covering the width of the scene. Scattered throughout the entire space are countless small, sparkling blue particles. These particles, along with the streaks, drift in various directions, creating a sense of depth and constant motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
