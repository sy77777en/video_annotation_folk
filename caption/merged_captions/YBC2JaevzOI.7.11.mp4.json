  "merged_caption": "In a slightly unsteady full shot, a person stands completely still in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a dark forest at night. The individual, wearing a white cap, a light-colored hooded jacket with a dark blue hood, and dark pants, is framed by three prominent trees in the foreground, with two on the left side and one on the right side of the screen. Additional trees with light-colored bark are visible in the middle ground with the person, while the ground in the foreground and middle ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and tangled branches. The background is completely dark. Filmed from a slightly unsteady eye-level position, the camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The person is seen from behind, facing away from the viewer and looking deeper into the woods, exhibiting no discernible movement throughout the video. The surrounding woods are enveloped in complete darkness, with the dimly lit central area highlighting the stillness of the scene.",

    "Scene": "At night, a scene unfolds within a dark forest. The ground is covered with a thick layer of leaves and fallen, tangled branches. Several tall, slender trees with light-colored bark are visible from the foreground to the background. In a dimly lit central area, a person wearing a light-colored hooded jacket and dark pants stands still with their back to the viewer. The surrounding woods are enveloped in complete darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
