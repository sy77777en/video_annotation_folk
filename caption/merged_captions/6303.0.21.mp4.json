  "merged_caption": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, with a medium shot size focusing on a man with medium brown skin tone and curly black hair, wearing an orange textured outfit. He is centrally positioned, facing the camera, and performing a rap while moving backward. The camera, at eye level with a shallow depth of field, smoothly advances toward him, maintaining a consistent height at the subject's level. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, holds a white comb, while the right hand, on the right side, holds pink-handled scissors. The setting is a vibrant barbershop with a black-and-white checkered pattern on the walls and floor, creating a bold visual contrast. The man gestures with his hands, crossing and uncrossing them as he speaks, appearing animated and expressive, engaging directly with the viewer. The barbershop is lively, with mirrors reflecting the scene and neon lights adding a colorful ambiance, capturing the essence of a bustling, stylish grooming space. The man remains in the middle ground, while the hands are in the foreground, emphasizing the haircut in progress. The background features mirrors and neon lights, adding depth and a lively ambiance to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
