  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a city scenery at night, captured from a low-angle perspective. The camera performs a very smooth movement, simultaneously panning to the right while moving to the left, focusing on the urban environment rather than a specific subject. A large, illuminated building, the Comédie-Française, occupies the center and right-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The building features classical architecture and is adorned with a prominent red and white circular banner on its facade. The foreground consists of a cobblestone street spanning the bottom of the frame, where long, horizontal light trails from moving traffic, including a bus, create vibrant streaks of red and white light flowing across the scene, capturing the dynamic motion of city life. On the far left, another building stands in the middle ground. To the right, a tree with some foliage and a cylindrical advertising column are also located in the middle ground. The dark sky fills the background at the top of the frame, providing a stark contrast to the warmly illuminated architecture. The shot utilizes a deep focus, ensuring that both the traffic-filled street and the grand, illuminated building are in sharp detail. Other lit buildings stand in the background, enhancing the bustling urban atmosphere. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHY\". The composition is designed to showcase the overall urban atmosphere, the architectural grandeur, and the vibrant flow of city life rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a bustling city street corner at night through a long-exposure or time-lapse technique. A grand, multi-story building with classical architecture, warmly illuminated against the dark sky, dominates the frame, featuring a prominent red and white circular banner on its facade. Streaks of white and red light from moving traffic flow across the cobblestone street in the foreground, creating a sense of motion and energy. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to showcase the overall urban atmosphere, the architectural grandeur, and the vibrant flow of city life rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a grand, illuminated building in a city at night. The long exposure captures the movement of traffic, which appears as vibrant streaks of red and white light flowing through the streets. The static architecture stands in stark contrast to the blurred motion of the city life around it.",
    "Scene": "A long-exposure, time-lapse shot captures a Parisian street corner at night. In the center, a grand, multi-story building with classical architecture, the Comédie-Française, is illuminated by warm lights. A large, circular red and white banner is affixed to its facade. The foreground features a cobblestone street where the movement of traffic, including a bus, creates long, horizontal streaks of white and red light. To the right, a tree with some foliage and a cylindrical advertising column are visible, while other lit buildings stand in the background under a dark sky. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHY\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
