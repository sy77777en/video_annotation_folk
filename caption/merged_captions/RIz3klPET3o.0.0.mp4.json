  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot with a grand staff positioned on the left side of the frame. A small, stylized figure with a white, conical hat, a white torso, and black legs rides a simple, hand-drawn sled, starting in the center and gliding along a single, undulating black line that forms part of a musical score. A scarf-like object trails behind the figure, displaying blue, white, green, and red colors. The camera smoothly trucks right, tracking the figure from a side-view perspective as it moves from left to right, navigating the gentle hills and dips of the line. Above the figure, a fermata and a pianissimo marking are visible in the upper half of the frame and above the black line. The camera occasionally makes slight pedestal-down movements as the character descends small slopes. As the camera moves, the initial grand staff with a treble and bass clef exits the frame, and new hand-drawn musical symbols, including a fermata, a pianissimo (pp) marking, and an eighth rest, appear in the bottom right. The scene is set against a plain white background, styled as a hand-drawn musical score, with more notations appearing as the scene progresses.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly trucks right, tracking a small, animated character on a bicycle from a side-view perspective. It occasionally makes slight pedestal-down movements as the character descends small slopes.",
    "Subject": "A small, stylized figure with a white, conical hat, a white torso, and black legs rides a simple, hand-drawn sled. A scarf-like object trails behind the figure, displaying blue, white, green, and red colors. The path for the sled is a single, undulating black line that is part of a musical score. This score begins with a grand staff, showing a treble clef and a bass clef. Other hand-drawn musical symbols are visible in the scene, including a fermata, a pianissimo (pp) marking, and an eighth rest.",
    "Motion": "A small, stylized figure on a sled moves from left to right, gliding along a single, undulating black line that forms part of a musical score. The figure smoothly navigates the gentle hills and dips of the line as it travels across the screen.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set against a plain white background, styled as a hand-drawn musical score. On the left, a grand staff with a treble and bass clef is depicted. Extending from the staff, a long, undulating black line serves as a path for a small, cartoonish figure riding a bicycle. The camera pans from left to right, following the character's movement. Above the path, other musical symbols like a fermata and a 'pp' dynamic marking are visible, with more notations appearing as the scene progresses.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide shot with a grand staff positioned on the left side of the frame. A small, stylized figure on a bicycle starts in the center, riding on a black line that nearly spans the middle of the frame. Above the figure, a fermata and a pianissimo marking are visible in the upper half of the frame and above the black line. The camera moves from left to right, following the figure as it travels along the undulating line. As the camera moves, the initial staff exits the frame, and new musical notations appear in the bottom right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
