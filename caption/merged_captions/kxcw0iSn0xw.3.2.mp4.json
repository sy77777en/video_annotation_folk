  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a close-up shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, there is one arm on the left of the frame and one arm on the right. The arm on the left is bare, muscular, and has a light skin tone, while the arm on the right is covered by a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. Each hand holds a red, round tomato, with the right tomato featuring a small green sticker. A transparent glass surface occupies the foreground across the entire frame, with a gold-colored door handle positioned on its right side. In the background, a white, paneled garage door with a small, circular metallic fixture, likely a lock, slightly left of center is visible, along with a dark shadow in the bottom right, cast on this background door. The video features a speed ramp effect, slowing down precisely at the moment when the tomatoes are released from the hands throwing them. The hands release the tomatoes, which then travel from their respective sides in the middle ground towards the foreground glass. The left tomato moves towards the left-center of the frame, and the right tomato, with a visible green sticker, moves towards the right-center. Both tomatoes travel through the air, with the one on the left slightly lower than the one on the right. They subsequently impact and splatter on the foreground glass surface, with the left tomato hitting at left-center and the right tomato at right-center, their red pulp and juice bursting outwards in a star-like pattern on this surface. The camera is static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, and employs a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground in focus.",

    "Subject": "The video features two human arms. The arm on the left is bare, muscular, and has a light skin tone. The arm on the right is covered by a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. Both arms are shown releasing a red, round tomato. One of the tomatoes has a small green sticker. Subsequently, the tomatoes are depicted splattering, with their red pulp and juice bursting outwards.",
    "Motion": "Two arms, one on the left and one on the right, simultaneously throw two red tomatoes forward. The tomatoes travel through the air, with the one on the left slightly lower than the one on the right. Both tomatoes then impact a clear glass door, as indicated by the handle visible on the right side of the frame, and splatter, their red pulp and juice bursting outwards in a star-like pattern.",
    "Scene": "In bright daylight, this outdoor scene shows two red, round tomatoes being thrown towards a transparent glass surface in the foreground. A gold-colored door handle is affixed to the right side of this glass. Behind the glass, a white, paneled garage door, featuring a small, circular metallic fixture, serves as the background. One of the tomatoes has a small green sticker. Initially, two light-skinned hands release the tomatoes. Upon impact with the glass, the tomatoes splat, their red liquid and pulp spreading outwards. A dark shadow, likely of a person, is cast onto the white paneled garage door.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a close-up shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, there is one arm on the left of the frame and one arm on the right. Each hand holds a tomato, also in the middle ground. A transparent glass surface occupies the foreground across the entire frame, with a gold-colored door handle positioned on its right side. In the background, a white, paneled garage door with a small, circular metallic fixture, likely a lock, slightly left of center is visible, along with a dark shadow in the bottom right, cast on this background door.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
