  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, capturing a woman from the waist up. The woman in the shiny, metallic gold dress is positioned slightly off-center to the right in the middle ground, while the interviewer with long brown hair stands on the left in the foreground. The trophy is held in the main subject's right hand, near the center of the frame in the middle ground. The interviewer holds the microphone labeled \"ET Canada\" towards the main subject. Several formally dressed individuals are scattered across the middle ground behind the main subject, creating depth. The background includes a large building with red and white circular patterns, visible in the top right and extending to the left side of the frame. A transparent tent-like structure with curtains is noticeable in the upper portion of the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more tightly on the main subject's upper body and face, shifting her to the foreground and further to the center of the frame. The interviewer is no longer visible, with only the microphone remaining at the bottom of the frame. The camera maintains the same height as the subject throughout, ensuring a direct perspective. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the two women, with the background elements providing context for the event's setting. The video shows the woman in the gold dress holding a trophy in her right hand while engaging in conversation with the interviewer. She alternates her gaze between the camera and the interviewer as she speaks, gesturing with her left hand. The camera begins at eye level, looking straight ahead, using deep focus. Initially static, it briefly zooms in while panning right to focus on the woman in the gold dress, then remains static with slight shaking.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. Initially static, the camera briefly zooms in while panning right to focus on the woman in the gold dress. It then remains static with slight shaking, maintaining smooth movement throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a woman in a shiny, metallic gold dress holding a trophy in her right hand while engaging in conversation with another woman who holds a microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" The woman in the gold dress alternates her gaze between the camera and the woman holding the microphone as she speaks, gesturing with her left hand to indicate active communication. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, remains relatively still, primarily holding the microphone steady. In the background, a crowd of formally dressed individuals moves subtly, contributing to the atmosphere of a red carpet event. The main subject's hand movements, gaze, and the positioning of the microphone emphasize the interview setting.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a lively outdoor event, likely a red carpet gathering, set in an urban environment. The scene is viewed from a broadcast POV shot, typical of television production, providing a clear and structured view of the event. It takes place during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The background features a large building adorned with decorative posters in red and white circular patterns, possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex. The setting is bustling with elegantly dressed attendees, suggesting a formal occasion. The event is held outside the building in a tent-like structure with a transparent roof and curtains. Notable visual elements include a prominent red carpet and a backdrop with reflective surfaces. Overlays are present, including a logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
