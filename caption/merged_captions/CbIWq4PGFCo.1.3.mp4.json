  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a static close-up shot of a young, light-skinned man with dark, wavy hair and light stubble, shown in profile and positioned in the center of the frame, facing toward the left side. He wears a dark, dusty-looking shirt and has a drop of sweat on his upper lip, with a pensive expression as he sits with his head slightly lowered. The man remains completely still throughout the video, maintaining his pensive expression as he looks straight ahead, with his gaze directed toward the left side of the frame. The outdoor scene is set in a dry, dusty landscape under warm, natural light, with the ground composed of light brown sand and dirt. In the background, a blurry, out-of-focus, earthy-toned expanse, possibly a rock formation or hillside, creates a muted backdrop, contrasting with the predominantly beige and tan environment. As the scene progresses, the camera gradually pans counterclockwise around the man, maintaining a smooth and steady motion from a level, eye-level perspective. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in sharp focus while blurring the background. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting some minor shaking, but it remains focused on the subject, capturing the stillness and contemplative mood of the scene.",

    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is set in a dry, dusty landscape under warm, natural light. The ground is composed of light brown sand and dirt. In the background, a soft-focus, earthy-toned expanse, possibly a rock formation or hillside, creates a muted backdrop. A young man with dark hair, wearing a dark shirt, is seen in profile in the foreground, his form contrasting with the predominantly beige and tan environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a static close-up shot of a man in profile, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground, facing toward the left side of the frame. As the scene progresses, the camera gradually pans counterclockwise around the man, maintaining a smooth and steady motion.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
