  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young woman with light brown skin and voluminous, curly, light brown hair, wearing a short-sleeved jersey that is vertically split, half dark green and half white with black chevrons on the white sleeve, occupies the right foreground. She smiles as she moves forward on an outdoor sports court in a residential urban area during the daytime. To her left, another person with dark hair tied in a bun, wearing a long-sleeved black top, is located in the left middle ground and moves energetically. In the middle ground, a young woman with blonde hair in a ponytail, wearing a black crop top and bright orange shorts, stands left of center. A soccer goal with a white frame and white netting is positioned on the far right. The background contains other people, trees, and multi-story apartment buildings with balconies visible beyond some green trees. The court is enclosed by metal railings, and a wall decorated with graffiti adds a vibrant touch to the setting. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, level angle at eye level, focuses on the people in the foreground with a shallow depth of field, exhibiting minor movement as it drifts down and from right to left. The scene captures several people in athletic clothing engaged in similar dancing or celebratory movements on the court's surface, contributing to the dynamic and lively atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
