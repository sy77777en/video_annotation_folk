  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a vast waterscape, likely at dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar, positioned in the middle ground, extends from the bottom right of the frame diagonally toward the center. Numerous small, dark fishing boats are clustered along this sandbar and on a smaller, separate islet to its right, gathered around a small, rustic settlement. The still water reflects the soft pink and lavender tones of the overcast sky, which occupies the upper third of the scene. In the background, a hazy landmass with low mountains is visible across the top of the frame. The camera begins with a slight arc to the left before transitioning into a slow, steady trucking motion from right to left, moving across the water and the spit of land with its moored boats, providing a dynamic and expansive view of the landscape. The entire landscape is kept in sharp detail by a deep focus, emphasizing the serene and expansive nature of the environment. The shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale of the environment and the peaceful, atmospheric mood created by the soft light, rather than to focus on a particular object or action.",

    "Camera": "This very smooth, high-angle aerial shot captures a serene lake and dock, with the entire landscape kept in sharp detail by a deep focus. The camera begins with a slight arc to the left before transitioning into a slow, steady trucking motion from right to left, moving across the water and the spit of land with its moored boats.",
    "Subject": "This video is a wide, high-angle landscape scenery shot of a vast and tranquil waterscape, likely at dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar or peninsula juts out into the calm water, which reflects the soft pink and lavender tones of the overcast sky. Numerous small, dark fishing boats are moored along the edges of this sandbar, gathered around a small, rustic settlement. In the far distance, a hazy landmass with low mountains stretches across the horizon. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale of the environment and the peaceful, atmospheric mood created by the soft light, rather than to focus on a particular object or action.",
    "Motion": "This is a high-angle aerial shot of a serene and expansive waterscape, likely at dawn or dusk. The sky is filled with soft, layered clouds in shades of pink and lavender above a hazy, distant shoreline with low mountains. A narrow spit of land or sandbar extends into the calm, reflective water, acting as a mooring point for numerous long, slender boats and featuring a small, simple structure.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive, calm body of water at either dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar of light-brown earth extends into the water, hosting a small, dark-colored structure. Numerous long, dark boats are moored along the edges of this sandbar and on a separate, smaller islet nearby. The still water reflects the soft pink and grey tones of the overcast sky, and a hazy landmass is visible on the distant horizon.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a vast waterscape. A long, narrow sandbar, positioned in the middle ground, extends from the bottom right of the frame diagonally toward the center. Numerous small boats are clustered along this sandbar and on a smaller, separate islet to its right. In the background, a distant landmass is visible across the top of the frame, situated below the overcast sky which occupies the upper third of the scene. The camera pans from left to right and then moves from right to left, providing a dynamic and expansive view of the landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
