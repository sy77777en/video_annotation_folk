  "merged_caption": "From a first-person point-of-view, the shot is framed from a seated perspective looking slightly down. In the immediate foreground, two dark-skinned, wrinkled hands extend upward from the bottom of the frame, with the right hand on the bottom right adorned with a large, light-colored ring and a bracelet made of brown and turquoise beads, and the left hand on the bottom left; both hands are actively gesturing with splayed fingers. Initially, the backs of both hands face the camera, then they turn to show the palms, and finally, they turn back to show the backs again. The camera is shaky, capturing a high-angle shot from eye level, looking down, and uses a shallow depth of field to keep the hands in the foreground in focus. A table occupies the middle ground in the lower half of the frame, holding a white coffee mug in the bottom center, another white coffee mug directly behind it, and a white plate with a partially eaten pastry and a spoon at the bottom right-center. Across the table, a man with short, dark hair, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is positioned in the left-center of the frame, slumped forward with his head resting on the table, but his right hand is raised with the index finger pointing up. In the background, another patron is seated in a red booth directly behind the central figure, wearing a shirt with colorful vertical stripes, while other patrons and booths are visible in the deeper background on both the left and right sides. The scene takes place inside a dimly lit diner at night, with warm lighting and shiny tinsel decorations adding to the ambiance.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of dark-skinned, wrinkled hands are held up with fingers splayed. The right hand is adorned with a large, light-colored ring on the ring finger and a bracelet composed of turquoise and brown beads. Seated across the table is a man with short, dark hair, wearing a light-colored t-shirt. He is slumped forward with his head resting on the table, but his right hand is raised with the index finger pointing up. On the table between them are two white coffee mugs; the one closer to the camera is full, while the one further away is about two-thirds full. A white plate holds a partially eaten pastry and a spoon. In a booth further back, another man is seen from behind, wearing a shirt with colorful vertical stripes.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands are held up.

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place inside a dimly lit diner at night. The perspective is from a table looking out over red booths. On the table are white ceramic mugs containing coffee, a plate with a partially eaten pastry, and a spoon. In the immediate foreground, two hands gesture upwards; the right hand wears a large, light-colored ring and a bracelet made of brown and turquoise beads. A person sits opposite, slumped forward with their head on the table, while other patrons occupy booths in the background under warm lighting and shiny tinsel decorations.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
