The dog is wearing a bright purple helmet with a silver, shield-shaped emblem on the front and cutouts for its ears. It is seated inside the cockpit of a futuristic vehicle, the light grey-blue body of which occupies the foreground from the bottom left, while its vibrant purple and pink frame extends across the middle of the frame. The cockpit is enclosed by a transparent purple canopy. In the background, a large red structure is visible on the right, with a bright blue sky and soft white clouds seen in the top center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and slightly zooms in smoothly, maintaining a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the dog in the cockpit in the foreground. The animated dog slightly turns its head to the right while speaking, raises its paw slightly, and then lowers it again as its eyes blink.",

    "Subject": "An animated, light-brown, fluffy dog with large brown eyes and a small black nose is shown from the chest up. The dog is wearing a bright purple helmet with a silver, shield-shaped emblem on the front and cutouts for its ears. It is seated inside the cockpit of a futuristic vehicle, which has a light grey-blue body with a hexagonal texture and a vibrant purple and pink frame around a transparent purple canopy.",
    "Motion": "The animated dog slightly turns its head to the right while speaking, raises its paw slightly, and then lowers it again as its eyes blink.",
    "Scene": "During the daytime, a sleek, light blue-grey aircraft with vibrant purple and magenta accents is positioned next to a large, red structure. The vehicle's body features a hexagonal texture, and its cockpit is enclosed by a purple-tinted canopy. Above, a bright blue sky with soft white clouds is visible. A small, light-brown dog wearing a purple helmet sits in the pilot's seat, looking out from the cockpit.",
    "Spatial": "This is a static medium shot of an animated dog positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. The dog is inside the cockpit of a vehicle, the light grey-blue body of which occupies the foreground from the bottom left, while its purple-framed canopy extends across the middle of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
