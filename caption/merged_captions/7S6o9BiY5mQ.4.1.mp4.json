  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot that frames the primary subject, a thin, orange, anthropomorphic creature with long limbs, large feet, a long snout, and two tufts of black hair on its head, in the middle ground. The creature, which has a lighter yellow patch on its stomach and wears a yellow bra-like top, is often positioned near the center or slightly off-center of the frame as it skillfully leaps and stretches across a chaotic, stylized urban landscape. The camera remains below the subject, looking upward, emphasizing the character’s elongated limbs and dynamic poses. The scene is set against a background of purple, pink, and teal watercolor-like splotches, filled with tumbling and floating objects, including a black grand piano, a gray cylindrical metal trash bin, a red fire hydrant, a black park bench, and an ornate black streetlight with a glowing yellow lamp. Industrial elements like a complex assembly of gray pipes with valves, the black silhouette of a large construction crane with a hook, a section of a gray metal railway bridge with wooden planks, and a standard traffic light are mostly in the background, stretching from the left to the right edges and sometimes intersecting the middle ground. As the subject moves diagonally across the frame in both rightward and leftward directions, the camera smoothly tracks its motion, shifting the subject’s position from center to left or right. The creature leaps from a grand piano attached to a complex mechanical contraption, navigating through the air and landing on various objects, eventually jumping through a network of pipes and onto a trash can. The camera smoothly moves backward, tracking the character from the front-side, then slightly pans and trucks to the left to continue following the character's trajectory, while the surrounding objects and structures appear to float or tumble, creating a sense of shifting perspective and spatial disorientation.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, the camera smoothly moves backward, tracking an orange cartoon character from the front-side as they jump between objects. The camera then slightly pans and trucks to the left to continue following the character's trajectory.",
    "Subject": "The primary subject is a thin, orange, anthropomorphic creature with long limbs, large feet, a long snout, and two tufts of black hair on its head. This character, which has a lighter yellow patch on its stomach and wears a yellow bra-like top, is shown in various dynamic, mid-air poses. The scene also contains numerous inanimate objects, including a black grand piano, a gray cylindrical metal trash bin, a red fire hydrant, and a black park bench. Industrial structures are also present, such as a complex assembly of gray pipes with valves, the black silhouette of a large construction crane with a hook, a section of a gray metal railway bridge with wooden planks, and a standard traffic light. Additionally, an ornate, black streetlight with a glowing yellow lamp appears in the scene.",
    "Motion": "An orange, anthropomorphic creature skillfully leaps from a grand piano attached to a complex mechanical contraption, navigating through the air and landing on various objects. It moves diagonally across the frame in both rightward and leftward directions, eventually jumping through a network of pipes and onto a trash can. ",
    "Scene": "This animated video depicts a chaotic, stylized urban landscape set against a background of purple, pink, and teal watercolor-like splotches. The scene is filled with tumbling and floating objects, including the black silhouettes of construction cranes, fragmented walkways, and abstract building shapes. A complex network of dark pipes, a black grand piano, a park bench, a red fire hydrant, and a trash can are also seen moving through the disorienting, shifting perspective. An orange, cartoonish creature navigates this dynamic and fragmented industrial setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot that frames the orange anthropomorphic creature in the middle ground, often positioned near the center or slightly off-center of the frame as it leaps and stretches across the scene. The camera remains below the subject, looking upward, which emphasizes the character’s elongated limbs and dynamic poses. Surrounding objects such as the black grand piano, trash bin, fire hydrant, park bench, and streetlight are distributed across the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame, occupying both the foreground and middle ground. Industrial elements like pipes, a railway bridge, and a construction crane are mostly in the background, stretching from the left to the right edges and sometimes intersecting the middle ground. As the subject moves, the camera smoothly tracks its motion, shifting the subject’s position from center to left or right, while the surrounding objects and structures appear to float or tumble, creating a sense of shifting perspective and spatial disorientation. The background remains filled with abstract, watercolor-like splotches, providing a static yet visually complex backdrop to the moving elements in the foreground and middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
