  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a man in black in the center middle ground leaping over a wooden and fabric sedan chair positioned in the center middle ground. This chair, holding a woman in a reddish-orange patterned garment, is carried by two bearers, one in the left middle ground and the other in the right middle ground, both wearing dark sleeveless tops with cutouts and light blue shorts. Wooden buildings frame the scene on the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background, with hills in the distant background and an overcast sky at the top. The street, showing cracks on its surface, extends from the foreground to the background. The hip-level camera maintains a level angle and uses deep focus, then tracks the man as he performs a backflip over the sedan chair, lands in the center middle ground, and runs forward along the center of the street, moving towards the middle ground. As he advances, the sedan chair and bearers shift to the background. Several people in dark blue traditional attire enter from the background and move into the middle ground, chasing him from both sides and the center of the street. Additionally, there are other individuals, some in traditional Japanese attire, already present on both sides of the road who gradually come into view as the camera moves. The camera moves backward smoothly, leading the man who is dancing towards it. The scene captures an outdoor setting on a street within a traditional Japanese-style village, with wooden buildings featuring purple awnings or accents and paper-screened windows. Beyond the village, green, tree-covered hills rise against the overcast sky, and wooden barrels are visible along the street.",

    "Subject": "The video centers on a man wearing a black T-shirt, black pants, black and white sneakers, and a dark gray duck-tongue hat, who is first shown leaping over a wooden and fabric sedan chair. This sedan chair holds a seated woman dressed in a reddish-orange patterned garment and is supported by two bearers; one on the left wears a dark sleeveless top with cutouts and light blue shorts, and the other on the right is similarly attired. The camera then tracks the man in black as he runs forward along the street, where other individuals, some in traditional Japanese attire, are present. Additionally, some individuals wearing dark blue outer garments, traditional Japanese attire, and light-colored shoes are chasing the man from behind.",
    "Motion": "In a traditional Japanese village setting, a man in black clothing and a cap performs a backflip over a wooden and fabric sedan chair, which is being carried by two bearers and contains a woman wearing a kimono. After landing, he turns to look back before quickly getting up and running toward the camera. Several men in dark blue clothing are chasing after him as he moves down the street. The background features traditional wooden houses, a cracked ground, and other villagers observing the scene.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a street within a traditional Japanese-style village. The paved street, showing cracks on its surface, is flanked by wooden buildings with tiled roofs. Some of these structures have purple awnings or accents and feature paper-screened windows. Beyond the village, green, tree-covered hills rise against an overcast sky. People, some in traditional clothing, are present in the background, and a palanquin-like structure is being transported. Wooden barrels are also visible along the street.",

The street extends from the foreground to the background. The camera, then maintaining a full shot and positioned at the subject's level, then tracks the man as he lands in the center middle ground and runs forward along the center of the street, moving towards the middle ground. As he advances, the sedan chair and bearers shift to the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
