  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a Japanese street corner on a wet, overcast day, with several cars moving through the scene. Initially, a curved traffic island with a tree and yellow flowers occupies the left foreground and middle ground, while a wet road curves from the bottom center toward the right, merging in the lower-right corner with another road that extends from the center of the distant background toward the bottom right. The camera, capturing a street-level view with a deep focus, moves forward while panning to the right, revealing more of the wet road and adjacent buildings. This movement is slightly unsteady, with some minor shaking. A black sedan, initially positioned on the right of the frame, moves out of the frame to the right. Meanwhile, a white compact car and a red hatchback appear to be moving toward each other across the middle ground. This panning motion shifts the composition, moving the traditional Japanese houses with tiled roofs on the left out of view and bringing a modern building with \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" signage and a small palm tree from the right middle ground to a more central position. Across the street, modern commercial buildings with large windows are visible, contrasting with the traditional houses. The dark, wet asphalt of the road reflects the gray sky as cars navigate through the winding, wet road. Throughout the shot, the traffic island remains a constant element in the left foreground, and a network of overhead power lines is visible across the top of the frame. The camera perspective invites the viewer to observe the environment's details, from the architecture to the flow of daily life, capturing the tranquil, rain-slicked atmosphere of the neighborhood.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot captures a street scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire view sharp. The camera moves forward while panning to the right, revealing more of the wet road and adjacent buildings. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some minor shaking.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot from a quiet Japanese town on a damp, overcast day. The shot lacks a central subject, instead focusing on the tranquil, rain-slicked atmosphere of the neighborhood. The camera perspective invites the viewer to observe the environment's details, from the architecture to the flow of daily life. At the beginning of the video, a black sedan moves along the asphalt road toward the right side of the frame. As the camera progresses and pans to the right, a white compact car and a red hatchback navigate the winding, wet road. In the foreground, a brick-lined traffic island with a leafy tree and yellow flowers sits beside a patch of red-painted pavement. Across the street, a modern white building with \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" signage and a small palm tree contrasts with more traditional residential houses, all under a web of overhead power lines against a cloudy sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a street-level view of a corner in a Japanese town on a wet, overcast day. A landscaped traffic island with a tree and yellow flowers sits in the foreground. Across the street, a modern building for an \"Exterior Garden\" business is visible, along with other houses and abundant greenery. Cars can be seen driving along the wet road.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene captures a wet street corner in a Japanese town on an overcast day. Initially, a black sedan is seen driving along the wet asphalt road toward the right side of the frame. In the foreground, a curved traffic island with a low brick wall is filled with green plants, yellow flowers, and a leafy tree. A portion of the sidewalk is painted bright red. The dark, wet asphalt of the road reflects the gray sky as cars, including a white compact car and a red hatchback, navigate through the winding, wet road. Across the street, modern commercial buildings with large windows are visible, one featuring a prominent sign for an \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" and a small palm tree. Traditional Japanese houses with tiled roofs are seen on the left, and a dense network of overhead power lines crisscrosses the sky. The camera pans slowly to the right, following the flow of traffic.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
