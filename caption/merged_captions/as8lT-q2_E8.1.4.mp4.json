  "merged_caption": "In a brightly lit, chaotic scene set within a vibrant, futuristic environment, a woman with long, curly brown hair, wearing a light-colored outfit and dark boots, is seen in a full shot viewed through three vertical panels. The camera is initially positioned below the subject, capturing her as she stands in the center-left of the middle ground. To her left is a figure with very pale skin, resembling a mannequin or decorative object, wearing a reddish-orange top, and to her right is a decorative element wrapped in spiraling, glowing blue bands over an orange surface. The background is a blur of bright, colorful neon lights in shades of red, green, and blue, suggesting a bustling city at night, while the foreground is covered with a layer of white, snow-like material. The central action involves the woman falling forward, crashing through a transparent barrier that shatters into numerous fragments, sending shards of glass and a flurry of white particles into the air. As she tumbles through the air, her body flipping over, the camera's perspective shifts to become level with her, panning left and tilting down to follow her fall. The slow-motion video, captured from a low, ground-level angle with a shallow depth of field, keeps the foreground in focus as the woman descends, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. She lands on the white material in the foreground, remaining on the left side of the frame throughout the sequence. Her hands are stained red, adding to the chaotic and dynamic nature of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a low, ground-level angle, using a shallow depth of field that keeps the foreground in focus. The slightly unsteady camera tracks a person as they smash through a glass door, panning left and tilting down to follow their fall.",
    "Subject": "In a brightly lit, chaotic scene, a woman with long, curly brown hair is falling forward through a pane of shattering glass. She wears a light-colored outfit, dark boots, and has red stains on her hands. In the middle ground, a figure with very pale skin, resembling a mannequin or decorative object, is visible, wearing a reddish-orange top. To the right, a decorative element of the room is wrapped in spiraling, glowing blue bands over an orange surface.",
    "Motion": "A woman is falling forward, crashing through a pane of glass that shatters into numerous fragments. She tumbles through the air, her body flipping over as only a small part of her exits the frame amidst the flying debris.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a vibrant, futuristic environment, viewed through three vertical panels. The background is a blur of bright, colorful neon lights in shades of red, green, and blue, suggesting a bustling city at night. In the foreground, a layer of white, snow-like material covers the ground. The central action involves a transparent barrier shattering, sending shards of glass and a flurry of white particles into the air. A figure is seen falling forward through the breaking barrier, while glowing blue bands, part of the room's decor, are visible to the right.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot viewed through three vertical panels, the camera is initially positioned below the subject. A woman stands in the center-left of the middle ground, with a pale-skinned figure to her left and a glowing decorative element to her right, both also in the middle ground. A layer of white material covers the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The woman falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground as she breaks through a glass pane. As she descends, the camera's perspective shifts to become level with her, and she lands on the white material in the foreground, remaining on the left side of the frame throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
