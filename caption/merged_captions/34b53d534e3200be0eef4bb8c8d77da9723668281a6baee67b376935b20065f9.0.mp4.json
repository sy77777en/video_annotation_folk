  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of the ground covered in yellow leaves, transitioning into a wide shot as the camera, initially at hip level, uses a high angle to look down at the path. The camera then smoothly tilts up and pans right, transitioning to a level angle. Initially, the focus is on the lower left corner, showing the leaves and part of a hedge in the foreground. As the camera moves, the hedge extends from the foreground into the background, with a fence positioned to the left of the hedge, also running from the foreground into the background. A woman appears in the middle-left portion of the frame, sitting on the ground and leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. She is in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the left of the center. Two men are introduced on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, facing the woman. One man kneels closer to the center-right, wearing a white shirt and navy jeans, while the other stands further back, near the right edge, wearing a yellow shirt. Both men have a fair skin tone and appear to be focused on something on the ground. The background includes several parked cars, including white, red, and black ones, indicating a suburban or park-like environment. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with multiple cars visible in the distance. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The transition from the initial close-up to the wide shot smoothly reveals the full scene, capturing all elements in their respective positions.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, using a high angle to look down at a path covered in yellow leaves. It then smoothly tilts up and pans right, transitioning to a level angle. Initially, the focus is on the hedge in the midground, but as the camera moves, the focus shifts to three people in the midground. The camera movement is very smooth, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge covered with yellow leaves that have fallen onto it. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, two men are facing her. One man is wearing a white shirt and navy jeans, and the other is wearing a yellow shirt. Both men have a fair skin tone. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with multiple cars visible in the distance.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a path covered in yellow leaves, with a hedge of green foliage in the background. As the camera pans to the right and tilts upward, a woman sitting on the ground against the hedge becomes visible. She is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Two men are crouched near her, one in a white shirt and the other in a yellow shirt, both appearing to be focused on something on the ground. The background includes a fence and some parked cars, indicating an outdoor setting.",
    "Scene": "The video begins by capturing an outdoor setting along a narrow pathway bordered by dense hedges adorned with yellow leaves. The ground is covered with a thick layer of fallen yellow leaves, creating a vibrant contrast against the gray pavement. Initially, the video focuses on the withered yellow leaves on the ground and the nearby hedge. As the camera pans right and tilts up, it transitions to a scene set during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. In the background, a fence runs parallel to the path, and a few trees are visible, adding to the natural ambiance. Several parked cars, including white, red, and black ones, suggest a suburban or park-like environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the notable visual elements being the bright yellow leaves and the lush greenery of the hedges.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up of the ground covered in yellow leaves, transitioning into a wide shot as the camera pans right and slightly upward.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
