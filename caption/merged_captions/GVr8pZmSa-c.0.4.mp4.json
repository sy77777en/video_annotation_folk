  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, where a wooden sailing ship is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying a significant portion of the frame. The ship features large, dark sails and a detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. On board, there are 3-4 white humanoid figures, adding a sense of life and activity to the scene. Turbulent ocean waves are visible in the foreground, middle ground, and background, surrounding the vessel. The camera starts above water and moves to an aerial level, maintaining a high angle looking down. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground where the ship is being tossed by rough seas. The camera moves backward and upward while tilting down, exhibiting significant unsteady shaking throughout the movement. Small, white humanoid figures are on the ship's deck; one is on the left side, and another is near the center-right. The ship is seen stationary in increasingly rough waters, with waves growing larger and more violent, causing the ship to tilt and rock heavily. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the camera pulls back and moves to a higher vantage point, now positioned above the ship. In this wide shot, the ship, still in the center and middle ground, appears smaller and is shown tilting and becoming partially submerged by the dominant ocean waves that fill the foreground, middle ground, and background. As the storm intensifies, the ship begins to sink, with more of its structure submerging into the turbulent sea. The ship continues to descend into the water, with only part of the mast and the top of the cabin remaining visible above the surface. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements.",

    "Subject": "The video features a wooden sailing ship navigating through rough, turbulent ocean waters. The ship is characterized by its large, dark sails and detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. On board, there are 3-4 white humanoid figures, adding a sense of life and activity to the scene. The vessel appears sturdy, with visible cabins and masts. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements. The ship's orientation changes from being prominently visible to partially submerged, suggesting a challenging journey through the stormy sea.",
    "Motion": "The ship, with its large sails and detailed wooden structure, is seen stationary in increasingly rough waters. The waves grow larger and more violent, causing the ship to tilt and rock heavily. The ship's figures remain on board. As the storm intensifies, the ship begins to sink, with more of its structure submerging into the turbulent sea. The ship continues to descend into the water, with only part of the mast and the top of the cabin remaining visible above the surface. ",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wooden sailing ship, featuring dark, unfurled sails and a railed deck, caught in a turbulent, dark blue ocean under dark, stormy skies. A few small, pale figures are visible on its deck. Large waves with dark blue water and white foam relentlessly batter the wooden vessel, causing it to rock violently and tilt precariously. The ship is progressively overwhelmed by the churning water, with its bow submerging first. Parts of the sails, mast, and the top of the cabin remain visible above the surface.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, where a wooden sailing ship is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying a significant portion of the frame. Turbulent ocean waves are visible in the foreground, middle ground, and background, surrounding the vessel. Small, white humanoid figures are on the ship's deck; one is on the left side, and another is near the center-right. The camera is initially at the ship's level. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the camera pulls back and moves to a higher vantage point, now positioned above the ship. In this wide shot, the ship, still in the center and middle ground, appears smaller and is shown tilting and becoming partially submerged by the dominant ocean waves that fill the foreground, middle ground, and background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
