  "merged_caption": "In a full shot filmed at the subject's level, a dark metal railing is positioned in the left foreground. In the middle ground, a man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit jacket, is initially seen in the center-left of the frame as a large window behind him shatters. A powerful torrent of cyan-colored water bursts from the window, violently pushing the man from his initial position backward and across the frame to the right. The camera is positioned outside, looking into a well-lit indoor space where massive, rectangular, ceiling-high aquariums are supported by a dark, columned framework. This slow-motion video is filmed from a fixed, slightly unsteady camera positioned at a low angle, looking upwards, and tilted at a Dutch angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp. As the water floods the middle ground and rushes toward the foreground, the man remains in the middle of the frame while stumbling to the right. He is thrown backward and to the right by the force of the rushing water, which appears to be bursting through a window shattering from the impact behind him. His body is contorted as he struggles to maintain his balance amidst the violent, splashing water. The water appears to be coming from in front of him, while a window shatters under the pressure behind him. A white \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is an overlay located in the bottom left corner of the scene.",

    "Scene": "The camera is positioned outside, looking into a well-lit indoor space where massive, rectangular, ceiling-high aquariums are supported by a dark, columned framework. A powerful torrent of cyan-colored water surges forward, causing a window in the middle ground to shatter violently. In the middle ground, a man is seen stumbling near the shattering window. In the left foreground, a dark, ornate metal railing is partially visible. A white \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is an overlay located in the bottom left corner of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
