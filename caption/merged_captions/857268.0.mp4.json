  "merged_caption": "In this extreme wide shot captured from a high angle above the subjects, a man and a woman are positioned in the center middle ground. They are walking hand in hand along a narrow sandbar that extends from the bottom left and center towards the top center of the frame. The man is wearing a dark t-shirt and shorts, while the woman is dressed in a light-colored top with a black decoration on the back and shorts. Both are barefoot, leaving footprints in the sand as they walk. Clear water flanks the sandbar on the left and right sides, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. The background shows a calm sea and a clear sky, indicating a sunny day. Further down the sandbar, in the top background, several smaller figures are visible. The central couple maintains their position in the center of the frame as they walk forward, remaining in the middle ground with minimal change in their size relative to the frame. The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly moves forward, tracking the couple walking on the beach from above and behind, then slightly descends at the end. The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. Their shadows are cast on the sand, indicating the sun is overhead. In the distance, two more people are visible, walking further along the beach. The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility. The setting is a narrow sandbar made of white sand, marked with footprints, extending meanderingly across the frame. This sandbar is surrounded on both sides by calm, clear, light-blue ocean water with small ripples near the shore. The lighting suggests a clear day, casting distinct shadows of the couple onto the sand.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an outdoor scene during the daytime. The setting is a narrow sandbar made of white sand, marked with footprints, extending meanderingly across the frame. This sandbar is surrounded on both sides by calm, clear, light-blue ocean water with small ripples near the shore. Two people, a man and a woman, are seen from behind, walking hand-in-hand along the sandbar away from the viewer. Further in the distance, along the same sandbar, several other smaller figures are visible. The lighting suggests a clear day, casting distinct shadows of the couple onto the sand.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
