  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a top-down view of a dark, topographical map filling the frame, displaying the mountainous terrain of the Appalachian region in the eastern United States. An orange marker labeled \"WASHINGTON\" is positioned in the lower right, while to its northwest, in the center-left area, a blue marker identifies the \"FLIGHT 93 CRASH SITE.\" A dashed blue line connects these two points. A solid blue line animates across the screen, starting at the top, making a sharp turn in the upper left corner, and then moving southeast with a slight arc before reaching the crash site marker. The map's intricate lines and textures provide a geographical context, emphasizing the locations' significance. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms out from the map, maintaining focus on the highlighted locations and the connecting line, which represents the flight path of Flight 93. The blue line extends from the crash site to Washington, indicating a route. The scene displays several graphical overlays, including the orange circular marker and text label \"WASHINGTON\" and the blue circular marker and text identifying the \"FLIGHT 93 CRASH SITE.\" The camera continues to zoom out gradually, providing a broader view of the map while keeping the focus on the key points and their connection.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
