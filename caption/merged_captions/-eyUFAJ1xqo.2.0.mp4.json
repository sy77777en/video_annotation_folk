  "merged_caption": "This low-angle medium shot frames a silver-colored mannequin on the left and a man in a long-sleeved shirt with short hair in the center, both positioned in the foreground under purple lighting. The scene is set within a dark, enclosed space, dominated by a ceiling composed of a grid of square, backlit panels emitting a uniform, saturated purple glow. The man actively dances from the center to the right side of the frame, swaying his body and moving his arms rhythmically. He first brings his right hand to the side of his head, then continues to dance, raising his arms alternately and together, culminating in a moment where he lifts both arms above his head with clenched fists. The mannequin remains static throughout. The camera, filmed from a low, hip-level angle, quickly pans right to focus on the man dancing. It then trucks right while panning slightly left, moving closer to him, before trucking left with a slight right pan to follow his movements. The entire scene is captured in deep focus with smooth camera movement, and the lighting casts a strong purple hue over both the mannequin and the man, creating a distinct visual effect. The walls of the room are dark and not clearly visible, enhancing the silhouette effect of the figures beneath the glowing grid.",

    "Subject": "The video features a silver-colored mannequin on the left  under purple lighting. The main subject is a man in the center, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He has short hair and is actively moving his upper body and dancing with his arms raised above his head. The lighting casts a strong purple hue over both the mannequin and the man, creating a distinct visual effect.",
    "Motion": "A man in a long-sleeved shirt dances in a dark room under a purple, gridded, illuminated ceiling. He sways his body and moves his arms rhythmically, first bringing his right hand to the side of his head. He then continues to dance, raising his arms alternately and together, culminating in a moment where he lifts both arms above his head with clenched fists.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, the scene is set within a dark, enclosed space. The primary source of light is a ceiling composed of a grid of square, backlit panels that emit a uniform, saturated purple glow. This illumination casts the figures within the room into silhouette as a man dances beside a mannequin beneath the glowing grid. The walls of the room are dark and not clearly visible.",
    "Spatial": "This low-angle medium shot frames a mannequin and a man both positioned in the foreground. In the background, a ceiling composed of a grid of purple-lit panels dominates the scene. The man actively dances from the center to the right side of the frame, moving his arms and upper body, while the mannequin remains static. The camera pans right and left to follow his movements."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
