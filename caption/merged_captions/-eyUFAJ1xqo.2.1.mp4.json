  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a woman with her hair pulled back is positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, against a completely black and featureless background. Initially, she is seen in profile, facing towards the left of the frame, her profile illuminated by a faint red light that provides a subtle rim-lighting effect, outlining the profile of her head, hair, and the curve of her shoulder. She wears dark, high-collared clothing that merges with the black background. The camera is stationary at eye level, maintaining a level angle and remains focused on the subject's face as she slowly turns her head counterclockwise towards the camera, transitioning into a three-quarter view while maintaining her central position. As she turns, her features remain largely in shadow due to the low light, and the focus details are not discernible.",

    "Camera": "The camera is stationary at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It remains focused on the subject's face as they rotate counterclockwise. Due to the low light, the focus details are not discernible.",
    "Subject": "A woman with her hair pulled back is shown in a dark setting, her profile illuminated by a red light. She is initially facing away from the camera, creating a silhouette that highlights the outline of her face and hair. She wears dark, high-collared clothing that merges with the black background. She slowly turns her head to face forward, though her features remain largely in shadow.",
    "Motion": "A woman, seen in profile and illuminated by a red light against a black background, slowly turns her head to face forward.",
    "Scene": "Against a completely black and featureless background, the silhouette of a person is visible. A faint red light provides a subtle rim-lighting effect, outlining the profile of their head, hair pulled back, and the curve of their shoulder. The person's head slowly turns from a side view to a three-quarter profile within the dark space.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground. Initially, she is seen in profile, facing towards the left of the frame. She slowly turns her head towards the camera, transitioning into a three-quarter view while maintaining her central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
