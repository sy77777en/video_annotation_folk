  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle, low altitude, forward-moving drone perspective. A vast, wet sand flat occupies the foreground and lower middle ground, stretching from the bottom of the frame. The camera glides smoothly forward over the expansive sandy beach, employing a deep focus to keep the entire landscape, from the immediate foreground to the distant mountains, sharp and clear. The light brown sand is marked with linear tracks and features patches of white and yellow deposits on its surface as the camera moves steadily forward. In the middle ground, a calm body of water extends horizontally across the scene, its surface reflecting the muted light from the overcast, grey sky. A long range of dark, verdant mountains is positioned in the background, spanning the width of the frame, with their peaks softened by a light haze. The overcast sky fills the top portion of the frame, contributing to the serene, slightly somber atmosphere. The camera's forward motion causes the foreground details to pass by and exit the bottom of the frame, while slowly advancing toward the water and the distant mountains. The shot's purpose is to convey the immense scale and tranquil solitude of the coastal environment, focusing on the interplay between the land, water, and mountains under the soft, diffused light.",

    "Camera": "Positioned at an overhead level with a level angle, the camera glides smoothly forward over the expansive sandy beach. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire landscape, from the immediate foreground to the distant mountains, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from a level-angle, forward-moving drone perspective over a vast, wet sand flat. The camera glides across the expansive beach, which is marked by varying shades of brown and beige sand, toward a calm body of water that reflects the muted, overcast sky. In the distance, a long range of dark, verdant mountains stretches across the horizon, their peaks softened by a light haze. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the immense scale and serene, slightly somber atmosphere of the coastal environment. The focus is on the interplay between the land, water, and mountains under the soft, diffused light, creating a feeling of solitude and tranquility.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a vast, sandy beach or tidal flat under an overcast sky. In the background, a long range of green mountains meets the sandy expanse. The camera slowly moves forward, gliding low over the sand toward the distant mountains.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone glides forward at a low altitude over a vast, wet, sandy flat under an overcast, grey sky. In the distance, a long range of green, hazy mountains lines the horizon. A calm body of water separates the sandy foreground from the mountains, its surface reflecting the muted light. The light brown sand is marked with linear tracks and features patches of white and yellow deposits on its surface as the camera moves steadily forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
