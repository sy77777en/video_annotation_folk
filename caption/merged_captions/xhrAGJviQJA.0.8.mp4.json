  "merged_caption": "Mounted on the side of a black, open-frame off-road vehicle, the camera captures a level-angle, wide-angle view, creating a diagonal composition. A medium shot of the vehicle and its driver, who is wearing a full-face helmet decorated with a blue, red, and white pattern and a dark-colored shirt, occupies the right and bottom-right of the frame, remaining fixed in this position in the foreground. The vehicle features a prominent black roll cage, large knobby tires, and a yellow bag secured to a metal rack on its roof. The unpaved path stretches from the bottom-left foreground into the middle ground, while the barren mountainside rises in the background on the right. The overcast sky fills the top-left of the frame, with the sun visible as a bright spot in the upper-left quadrant. As the vehicle drives forward along a dirt road with gravel, the camera's point of view rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene to spin. The camera rolls first clockwise as the vehicle tips over and hits the ground, then bounces back by rolling counterclockwise, coming to rest with the vehicle tilted 90 degrees on its side. The movement is unsteady, with significant shaking during the impact. The locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object keeping its perspective fixed, follows the vehicle driving along a steep, unpaved path on the side of a barren mountain. The rugged terrain consists of dirt, gravel, and scattered rocks. The sky above is overcast with dense white and grey clouds, through which the sun shines as a bright, diffused spot. The camera's rolling creates a varying Dutch angle, giving a dynamic sense of scene rotation.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, the camera is mounted on the left side of the off-road vehicle, capturing its forward movement as it crashes to the ground. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, beginning with a level angle that quickly becomes a severe, varying Dutch angle. The camera rolls clockwise as the vehicle tips over and hits the ground, then bounces back by rolling counterclockwise, coming to rest with the vehicle tilted 90 degrees on its side. The movement is unsteady, with significant shaking during the impact.",
    "Subject": "A black, open-frame off-road vehicle is positioned on the right side of the view. The vehicle features a prominent black roll cage, large knobby tires, and a yellow bag secured to a metal rack on its roof. Inside the vehicle, a person is seated in the driver's position, wearing a full-face helmet. The helmet is decorated with a blue, red, and white pattern. The driver is also wearing a dark-colored shirt and is oriented forward, looking ahead.",
    "Motion": "An off-road vehicle drives forward along a dirt road with gravel. As the vehicle moves, the camera's point of view rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene to spin.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
