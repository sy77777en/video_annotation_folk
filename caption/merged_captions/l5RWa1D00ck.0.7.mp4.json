  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium close-up shot of a man with short, light-colored, slicked-back hair, wearing a dark-colored jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, visible at the collar. He is initially seen from the back and positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. The scene is set outdoors at night or dusk, characterized by a cool, blue-toned, low-light environment. Behind him, the middle ground and background consist of blurred, dark forms and indistinct lights, suggestive of multiple vehicles, possibly around four. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. It smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the man, who remains the foreground focus. As the camera rotates to its right, the man's orientation changes from his back facing the camera to his right profile, revealing his light skin. The camera continues to circle around him, capturing his face in a three-quarter view as it continues to rotate. The man finally faces the camera directly, with a neutral expression, while the background remains blurred and indistinct. By the end of the shot, he is positioned slightly left of the center foreground, looking toward the camera.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the man.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with short, light-colored, slicked-back hair, wearing a dark-colored jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, visible at the collar. Initially, he is seen from the back, and the camera pivots around him to the right, using him as the focal point. This movement reveals his profile, then a three-quarter view, and eventually his entire face. He has light skin and starts by looking towards the right side of the frame, but as the camera shifts, he ultimately ends up facing the lens with a neutral expression.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a man standing with his back to the camera, looking into a dimly lit, blue-tinted environment. As the camera rotates around him, the background reveals blurred figures and vehicles, suggesting a public road or a roadway frequented by vehicles. The camera continues to circle around him, revealing his side profile. The camera then captures his face in a three-quarter view as it continues to rotate. The man finally faces the camera directly, with a calm expression, while the background remains blurred and indistinct.",
    "Scene": "The video is set outdoors at night or dusk, characterized by a cool, blue-toned, low-light environment. A person with short, slicked-back hair, wearing a dark jacket over a lighter shirt, is initially seen from the back before turning to a profile view. The background is largely out of focus, featuring some indistinct lights and large, dark, blurred forms, suggestive of multiple vehicles, possibly around four.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a medium close-up shot of a man, who is initially seen from the back and positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. Behind him, the middle ground and background consist of blurred, dark forms and indistinct lights. The camera then pivots to its right, arcing around the man who remains the foreground focus. During this movement, the man's orientation changes from his back facing the camera, to his right profile, and then to a three-quarter view. In the end, his full face comes into view. By the end of the shot, he is positioned slightly left of the center foreground, looking toward the camera. The camera is at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
