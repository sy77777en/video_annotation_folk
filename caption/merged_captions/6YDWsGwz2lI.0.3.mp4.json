  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a cityscape, capturing towering skyscrapers that dominate the frame. The buildings are positioned primarily in the left and right sections, creating a canyon-like effect as they rise vertically. The left side includes a light fixture positioned in the foreground, while the right side showcases a mix of modern and classical architectural styles in the middle ground, extending towards the lower left corner of the frame into the background. The sky, visible in the top portion of the frame, adds depth with its partly cloudy appearance. The camera is positioned at a low angle, emphasizing the scale and height of the buildings. Throughout the video, the camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, maintaining the same spatial composition. The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled low, looking up at the buildings. It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, capturing the upward view of the skyscrapers without any shaking. The video captures an urban setting with towering skyscrapers lining a narrow street, creating a canyon-like effect. The scene is outdoors, set in a cityscape with tall buildings featuring numerous windows and a mix of modern and classical architectural styles. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light casting long shadows. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible between the clouds. Notable visual elements include the vertical lines of the buildings, the texture of the stone and glass facades, and a prominent light fixture on the left side, which adds a warm glow to the otherwise cool-toned environment. The scene remains static, with no visible movement or changes, maintaining a calm and serene atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled low, looking up at the buildings. It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, capturing the upward view of the skyscrapers without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a view of towering skyscrapers with a focus on the vertical lines and architectural details of the buildings. The perspective emphasizes the height and scale of the urban environment, with the sky visible between the structures, adding depth. The lighting highlights the textures and shadows on the buildings, creating an atmospheric urban scene. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the grandeur and complexity of the cityscape itself.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a view of a city street, looking up at tall buildings on both sides. The buildings are modern with numerous windows, and the sky is partly cloudy. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a sense of motion as it approaches the buildings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
