  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a quiet, rain-soaked suburban street, framed with the road running from the bottom center to the top center, creating a sense of depth. Houses with light-colored facades are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Lush green trees line the sidewalks, with some branches extending into the foreground on the left and right edges. Power lines stretch horizontally across the top of the frame, adding structure and depth to the background. Vehicles are visible towards the end of the road in the background, moving in and out of view, introducing subtle motion. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, simulating a first-person view that enhances the immersive experience. It maintains deep focus and a large depth of field as it moves forward and downward along the street, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. The wet pavement reflects the muted light from the overcast sky, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. The scene captures a gently sloping road flanked by modest, cream-colored houses with tiled roofs. The greenery and houses create a serene atmosphere, with the leaves of the trees and shrubs glistening with raindrops. The focus is on the interplay of natural and urban elements, highlighting the tranquil yet subtly active environment. As the camera moves, it aligns with the road, effectively maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the video. Towards the end of the road, vehicles travel in both directions, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene and tranquil environment. The network of power lines stretching across the gray sky adds a sense of depth to the scene, completing the composition of this rain-soaked suburban street.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing a quiet residential street on a rainy day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a gently sloping road flanked by modest, cream-colored houses with tiled roofs. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves glistening with raindrops. Overhead, a network of power lines stretches across the gray, overcast sky, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The wet pavement reflects the muted light, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. Towards the end of the road, vehicles are visible in the background, moving in and out of view, adding a subtle dynamic element to the serene, rain-soaked environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of a quiet, rain-soaked suburban street. The scene is framed with the road running from the bottom center to the top center, creating a sense of depth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
