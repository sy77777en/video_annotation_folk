  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot features a light-skinned young woman with long brown hair pulled back into a high ponytail, wearing a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt, in the right foreground, positioned in profile and looking toward the left. Her out-of-focus reflection is visible in a large mirror in the left middle ground. In the background, a window with horizontal blinds is visible in the center, and shelves holding various containers are on the right. The walls are a light, neutral color, contributing to the muted, cool-toned color palette and soft, diffuse lighting of the indoor scene. The young woman, initially seen in profile looking towards the left side of the frame, moves her mouth as she speaks, appearing to be speaking with a slight smile on her face. She then turns her body to the left, aligning both her head and body in the same direction, smiling as she finishes talking. As she briefly turns her body slightly and moves closer to the camera, she becomes out of focus in the foreground, appearing as if she is about to leave the room. The camera is at eye-level with a level-angle shot and a shallow depth of field, focusing on the young woman in the foreground. The handheld camera work introduces a slight unsteadiness to the shot, maintaining the subject's level throughout the scene.",

    "Scene": "This indoor scene is characterized by a muted, cool-toned color palette and soft, diffuse lighting. A girl is turning her body as if she is about to leave the room. A large mirror is positioned in the room, showing a blurry reflection. In the background, a window with horizontal blinds is visible, along with shelves holding various containers.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
