  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium full shot of a silhouetted man positioned on the right side of the frame, facing a white pickup truck with rooftop tents. The man is in the foreground, while the truck is in the middle ground, slightly to the left. A camping table with various items, including a lantern and some containers, is in front of the truck, positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The scene is set in a rugged, outdoor desert environment during twilight, with distant mountains silhouetted against a dim sky in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward, following the man from behind with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. The man, wearing a hat, walks steadily towards the white pickup truck parked on uneven terrain, suggesting a camping scenario. The truck's metallic surface contrasts with the dark surroundings, while the table holds items like a lantern and cooking equipment. The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment. The soft, muted colors of dusk characterize the scene, with shadows cast by the low light. The spatial arrangement remains stable, with no significant movement or changes in the framing of the subjects and elements. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or weather effects, indicating a remote or outdoor setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
