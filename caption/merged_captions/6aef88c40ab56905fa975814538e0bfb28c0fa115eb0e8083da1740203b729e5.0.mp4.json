  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, features a young man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a purple hoodie, sitting in a wheelchair in the center-right foreground, holding an orange basketball with black lines. He actively shifts the ball between his hands and moves his upper body from side to side with concentration. Behind him, in the center-left middle ground, a young woman with light skin and blonde hair, wearing a light purple sweatshirt, light-wash jeans, and a black baseball cap, stands and dances energetically, raising and pumping her arms in the air while swaying her body and smiling. The scene is set on an outdoor basketball court during the daytime, with a tall, green chain-link fence separating the court from a dense background of leafy green trees. A portion of a basketball hoop with a clear backboard featuring a white border and a blue support pole is visible on the far right. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the young man and the woman in sharp focus, and pans slowly and smoothly to the left, following their actions as the man continues to move his upper body and the ball within his space, and the woman dances energetically behind him.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
