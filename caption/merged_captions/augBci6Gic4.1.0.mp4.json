  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot frames a fair-skinned woman standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground, illuminated by spotlights. She wears a long-sleeved, V-neck shirt with horizontal black and beige stripes, tucked into black high-waisted pants, and a black cap or turban covers her hair. Her arms are extended out to her sides with her palms facing up, and she looks slightly upward with her mouth open as if speaking or singing. In the background, four circular, cool-toned spotlights are visible at the top of the frame, adding to the ambiance. A small portion of another person can be seen in the middle ground on the far left, wearing a white scarf over a darker top, while a simple, dark stool is partially visible in the middle ground to the right of the center. The scene is set on a dark stage against a completely black background, with the central performance area illuminated by an unspecified light source, creating a defined pool of light. The overall environment is minimalist and stark, with the lighting isolating the stage from the surrounding darkness. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and performs a very smooth and minor counterclockwise arc around the woman, maintaining a deep focus on her as she holds a fixed pose.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
