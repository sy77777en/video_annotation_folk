  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of the blue-gray cartoon cat, Tom, whose face is covered by a shiny metal iron, positioned prominently in the foreground. Tom’s body is upright, with his large pink ears extending to the left and right, and the iron’s cord hanging downward. Tom stands at the same height as the camera, which is level with his torso and face. Behind him, the softly lit bedroom is visible, with the bed and lamp to the left in the background and a large window with city lights to the right. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. The shot is completely static, with no camera movement or shaking. The focus remains on the animated character (Tom), who is rendered sharply in the foreground, while the real-world background is consistently out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field effect. As the scene progresses, the electric iron, which is silver with black and red details and has a reflective surface, presses firmly against Tom's face, flattening his features and leaving an imprint. The iron then slides vertically out of the shot, causing Tom to remain momentarily motionless with his face frozen in a shocked expression and his whiskers curled from the heat. After a brief pause, Tom shakes his head to recover and then lunges forward, quickly jumping to the left, causing his torso and ears to sweep across the center and left side. The background elements, including the bed, lamp, and window, remain stationary, maintaining their positions relative to Tom’s movement. Throughout, the camera maintains a consistent height and distance, keeping the action at eye level and Tom’s movement clearly visible within the room’s spatial context.",

    "Camera": "**Description of Video’s and Camera’s Configuration:**\n\nThe camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. The shot is completely static, with no camera movement or shaking. The focus remains on the animated character (Tom), who is rendered sharply in the foreground, while the real-world background is consistently out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field effect.",
    "Subject": "The video features an animated blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with large pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and a light blue belly. The cat's head is pressed by a shiny metal electric iron, flattening its features. The iron's cord hangs down, and the iron's faceplate is oriented forward, pressing against the cat's face. The cat's large ears protrude from the sides, and its whiskers, slightly singed, curl stiffly from the heat. As the iron moves away, the cat's face is imprinted with the shape of the iron, leaving its expression frozen in shock. The cat's appearance is distinctly cartoonish, with exaggerated proportions and smooth, simplified textures, while the iron is rendered with realistic metallic reflections and details, creating a striking contrast between the animated body and the realistic object.",
    "Motion": "The cat, named Tom, stands upright as the electric iron presses firmly against its face, flattening its features and leaving an imprint. The iron then moves away from Tom's head, causing him to remain momentarily motionless with his face frozen in a shocked expression and his whiskers curled from the heat. After a brief pause, Tom shakes his head to recover and then lunges forward.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom at night, with a large window revealing a dark sky and city lights in the distance. The room features a bed with white linens, a beige padded headboard, and a wooden nightstand topped with a rectangular lamp that emits a warm glow. The walls are light-colored, and the window is framed by long, neutral curtains. A blue animated character with pink ears and a light blue belly is present, with a shiny metal iron covering its face; the iron is silver with black and red details, a visible cord, and a reflective surface. The character’s placement and movement are consistent with the room’s layout, and the scene maintains a clear distinction between the animated figure and the realistic environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
