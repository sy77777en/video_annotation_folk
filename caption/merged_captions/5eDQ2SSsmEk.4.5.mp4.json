  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on a hand and a screwdriver. Initially, the screwdriver is blurred and occupies the center portion of the frame, while the platform is partially clear in the bottom section. In a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere with a rough, dusty surface in the foreground, the hand, with a light skin tone, enters the frame from the left, holding both a screwdriver with a metallic shaft and a dark handle, and a small metallic nail. The hand is positioned in the left-center of the frame and approaches the platform with a rough, textured surface. The hand places the nail onto the platform in the lower-left corner of the frame but does not use the screwdriver to drive the nail into it. The platform extends from the foreground to the middle ground, and the nail stands upright after being placed. The hand subsequently exits the frame from the lower-left side, leaving the nail in the lower-left corner. The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, highlighting the action of placing it. The background remains blurred throughout, suggesting a spacious area with indistinct structures, possibly machinery or tools, contributing to the industrial feel. The lighting is low, casting shadows and creating a moody ambiance, with a muted color palette dominated by shades of gray and brown. The video features a static camera at a level angle, focusing on the nail in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field, causing the background and foreground to blur significantly.",

    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a hand holding a screwdriver, which is initially blurred, and a platform that is partially clear. The hand, with a light skin tone, becomes visible as it grips the screwdriver, a tool with a metallic shaft and a dark handle. The hand places a small, metallic nail on the platform, which has a rough, textured surface. The nail is positioned in the lower-left corner of the frame. After placing the nail, the hand moves out of the frame, leaving the nail standing upright on the platform. The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, emphasizing the action of placing it.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit environment, a hand holding both a screwdriver and a small metallic nail approaches a platform with a rough, textured surface. The hand places the nail onto the platform but does not use the screwdriver to drive the nail into it. The hand then moves away, leaving the nail standing upright on the platform.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features a rough, dusty surface in the foreground, possibly a workbench or floor, with a metallic screw prominently placed on it by a hand. The background is blurred, suggesting a spacious area with indistinct structures, possibly machinery or tools, contributing to the industrial feel. The lighting is low, casting shadows and creating a moody ambiance. The overall color palette is muted, with shades of gray and brown dominating the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on a hand and a screwdriver.

As the hand enters the frame from the left, it holds both the screwdriver and a screw in the middle ground, with the hand positioned in the left-center of the frame.

The hand subsequently exits the frame from the lower-left side, leaving the screw in the lower-left corner. The focus shifts from the screwdriver to the screw, highlighting the action. The background remains blurred throughout, indicating a spacious area with indistinct structures. The camera maintains a level position relative to the hand and the platform."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
