  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of three individuals around a table. The older man, with short gray hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt and a beige vest, is centered in the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The woman in a pink sweater stands on the left side of the frame, and the woman in a teal jumpsuit over a blue shirt, with medium-length dark hair and bangs, stands on the right. The table, covered with a light blue cloth, occupies the foreground, with a rotating tray holding various bottles and jars placed centrally on it. The floral-patterned wallpaper and framed pictures adorn the background, along with a lamp on the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field. Initially, the focus is on the man in the midground. The man reaches out and presses a button on the tray, causing the bottles and jars, including soy sauce and vinegar, to start rotating smoothly. The camera exhibits a smooth rack focus, shifting to the items on the table in the foreground. The woman on the left and the woman on the right remain stationary and watch the tray as it begins to spin. The camera shows minor, smooth zooming in towards the table. The spatial arrangement keeps the subjects evenly distributed across the frame, maintaining a balanced composition. The setting is a cozy dining room with a vintage aesthetic, featuring floral-patterned wallpaper and framed artwork on the walls. The lighting is warm, emanating from a lamp with a soft glow, creating a comfortable ambiance. The setting suggests a casual, intimate gathering, contributing to the homely atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
