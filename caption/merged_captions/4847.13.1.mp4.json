  "merged_caption": "This medium shot features a woman with dark, curly hair styled up, wearing a textured coat with a distinctive collar and button details, initially positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground. A dark vanity table is situated in the bottom left and extends towards the center, with an ornate oval mirror on top of the table, positioned on the left side of the frame. In the background, wallpaper with a stylized, possibly hand-drawn, figure with a crown-like headdress is visible on the right. The setting includes a decorative mirror and various items on the table, suggesting a personal or domestic environment. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing deep focus to maintain a large depth of field. Initially, the camera angle is level, but it tilts down to a slight high angle with some visible shaking. The woman leans forward, her upper body moving towards the bottom center of the frame as she reaches into a drawer of the vanity table, retrieves an item, and places it on top of the table, interacting with objects on the surface. Her posture indicates focus on the task at hand. The dark wooden dresser with ornate drawer pulls and an oval mirror positioned on top in a carved frame sits against the wall. At the conclusion of the video, she returns to an upright position, and the camera maintains its focus on her, capturing the entirety of her motion within the frame. The video is presented in black and white, enhancing the contrast and texture of the scene.",

    "Motion": "The woman leans forward, reaches into a drawer of the vanity table, retrieves an item, and places it on top of the table before straightening up.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a room with distinctive wallpaper featuring a stylized, possibly hand-drawn, figure with a crown-like headdress. A dark wooden dresser with ornate drawer pulls and an oval mirror positioned on top in a carved frame sits against the wall. A figure in a light-colored, collared jacket with dark buttons is seen interacting with the dresser, bending down towards its drawers. The video is in black and white.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
