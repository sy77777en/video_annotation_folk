  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot features a young, light-skinned woman with curly, light brown hair pulled up and away from her face, positioned slightly right of center in the foreground. Her wide, light green eyes are watery, and her mouth is slightly agape, creating an expression of shock or distress. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment with a dark, indistinct background. To her left, the background remains dark and indistinct, while the vertical edge of a light-colored door frame is visible in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, capturing the woman with an extremely shallow depth of field and remains static throughout the shot, with no change in the subject's framing. Initially, the woman gazes directly ahead, then gradually tilts her face to rest against the structure next to her. The scene is characterized by soft, focused lighting and a desaturated, cool-toned color palette.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at a level, eye-level perspective, effectively capturing the woman in the foreground with an extremely shallow depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A close-up shot focuses on the face of a young, light-skinned woman with curly, light brown hair pulled up and away from her face. Her wide, light green eyes are watery, and her mouth is slightly agape, creating an expression of shock or distress.",
    "Motion": "In a close-up shot, the woman initially gazes directly ahead, then gradually tilts her face to rest against the structure next to her.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
