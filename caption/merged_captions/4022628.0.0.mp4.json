  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme close-up shot of two orange slices against a blurred, warm brown background. Initially, the upper slice is framed in the top right foreground, displaying its vibrant orange pulp and distinct white pith beneath the peel, while the lower slice is in the bottom right foreground, revealing its bright orange, juicy, segmented flesh and a similar white pith layer. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground, and primarily rolls clockwise with subtle vibrations and movements, slightly unsteady with some shaking. The view shifts smoothly from the lower slice to the upper slice, maintaining an extreme close-up focus on the two orange slices throughout the sequence. As the camera rolls, the upper orange slice increasingly occupies the top left and top center foreground, ultimately taking up most of the left side of the frame. Concurrently, the lower orange slice merely shifts to the right, ultimately occupying a small portion of the upper right side of the frame. Midway through the video, a soft, light-colored glow appears between the two slices, enhancing the vibrant orange color of the fruit throughout the shot. Consequently, by the end of the video, the two orange slices dominate more of the frame, diminishing the visible portion of the brown background. The glistening, wet texture on their cut surfaces is highlighted, with the segmented texture and the white pith separating the flesh from the rind clearly visible. The background remains a consistent, solid brown color, providing a stark contrast to the vivid orange hues of the fruit slices.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
