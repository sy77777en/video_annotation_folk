  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, capturing a yellow and white water taxi in the bottom right middle ground and a large, white, circular buoy with a dark-colored base in the middle left middle ground, both set against a vast expanse of turquoise water. The water taxi, featuring a long, bright yellow hull and a white cabin positioned towards the stern, travels from right to left across the water at a steady speed, creating a white wake behind it. The side of the hull is marked with blue text that includes \"Molino Stucky Hilton Venice\" and \"Skyline VE 8257,\" as well as a blue and white logo near the bow. The cabin has a series of windows along its length, and a white radar antenna is mounted on the roof. A stack of orange life preservers is visible at the rear of the vessel. As the water taxi moves, the camera begins with a quick zoom-in on the yellow boat and then smoothly and quickly pans left, tracking the boat as it moves across the water. During this movement, the buoy exits the frame to the right, and the water taxi becomes the central subject, ending up in the bottom center of the frame. The camera captures this scene in a greatly accelerated time-lapse video, from a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective with deep focus. As the camera zooms in, transitioning the framing to a full shot of the boat, the water taxi becomes larger in the frame, emphasizing its movement and details, such as the text and logo on the hull, the windows along the cabin, and the stack of life preservers, as it cruises across the surface, leaving a small wake.",

    "Motion": "A yellow and white water taxi travels from right to left across the water at a steady speed, creating a white wake behind it as it moves past a stationary white buoy.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime scene set on a large expanse of turquoise water, a long water taxi with a yellow hull and a white cabin cruises across the surface, leaving a small wake. The side of the boat has text that reads \"Molino Stucky Hilton Venice,\" \"Skyline,\" and \"VE 8257.\" To the left, a white, circular buoy floats on the rippling water. A stack of orange life preservers is visible on the back of the vessel as it moves from left to right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
