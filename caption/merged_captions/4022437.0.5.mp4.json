  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames the back of a tan leather car seat in the left foreground, showcasing its stitched seams and lower storage pocket. To the right, in the middle ground, is the front passenger seat with its headrest, and an open door revealing a bright, sunlit exterior with a building visible in the distance. A rectangular, tinted glass sunroof is set into the light-colored roof lining at the top of the frame, with a grab handle near the right side. The camera smoothly moves to the right, downward, and backward, while tilting downward, transitioning from a low angle to a level angle. This movement gradually reveals the lower section of the front seats and the rear center console, crafted from dark, polished wood and complemented by silver trim, including a silver-trimmed air vent. The console comes into view in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground between the seats, while the sunroof moves out of the top of the frame. By the end of the shot, the storage pockets on the backs of both front seats are visible at the bottom left and bottom right. A shallow depth of field keeps the foreground elements of the car's interior in focus.",

    "Subject": "The video captures an interior view of a car from a position just behind the front left seat, facing the front right seat. The tan leather car seats are prominently featured, with the back of the front left seat, showcasing its stitched seams and lower storage pocket, in the foreground. To the right, the front passenger seat with its headrest is visible. Above, a rectangular, tinted glass sunroof is set into the light-colored roof lining, with a grab handle near the right side. As the camera moves downward and tilts slightly, the rear section of the center console comes into view between the front seats. This console is crafted from dark, polished wood and is complemented by silver trim, including a silver-trimmed air vent. The front passenger door is open, revealing a bright exterior through the window.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly tilts downward, starting with a view focused on the upper part of the front car seat. As the camera moves, it gradually reveals the lower section of the front seats and the rear center console, bringing the air vent into frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a car with tan leather upholstery, viewed from the back seat looking toward the front passenger side. The back of one front seat occupies the left foreground, while the passenger seat with its headrest is in the middle ground on the right. The passenger door is open, revealing a bright, sunlit exterior with a building visible in the distance. A glass sunroof is seen at the top of the interior. The view slowly tilts downward, bringing a rear center console into frame, which features a silver-trimmed air vent and a dark wood-grain accent.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames the back of a tan leather car seat in the left foreground. To the right, in the middle ground, is the front passenger seat, with an open door and a sunroof visible at the top of the frame. The camera then executes a slow downward tilt. This movement brings the rear of the center console, featuring an air vent, into view in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground between the seats, while the sunroof moves out of the top of the frame. By the end of the shot, the storage pockets on the backs of both front seats are visible at the bottom left and bottom right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
