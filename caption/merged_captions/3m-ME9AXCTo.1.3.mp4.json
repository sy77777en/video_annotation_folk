  "merged_caption": "A man and a woman are featured in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The man has voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair and is wearing a suit jacket that appears dark under the current lighting conditions, over a white collared shirt, with a white boutonnière on his lapel. The woman has long, straight blonde hair and is wearing a light-colored, possibly strapless, top or dress, with a corsage visible on her left wrist. They slow dance, holding each other closely, swaying rhythmically from side to side and turning slowly in place while maintaining their embrace. Throughout the clip, they look at each other and smile as they move together, and as the video progresses towards the end, the couple embraces more tightly, enhancing the intimacy of their dance. The camera, from a low angle positioned above a person's hip but below their shoulder, arcs counterclockwise around the couple, using a shallow depth of field to keep them in focus. As they rotate, their positions relative to the camera shift continuously while they remain centrally framed, alternating who is on the left and right of the frame, and at times the back of the man's head or the woman's head is seen in the center. The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor setting, likely a dance or party, with a hazy atmosphere. The space is decorated with glittery, star-shaped ornaments and small string lights hanging from above, visible in the top portion of the frame. The environment is illuminated by soft, colorful lighting, with prominent red and green glows creating a festive ambiance. In the background, dark vertical lines, which appear to be cloth draped from the ceiling, are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
