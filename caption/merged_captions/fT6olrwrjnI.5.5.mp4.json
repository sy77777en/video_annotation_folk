  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, an anime-style young man with spiky white hair and an intense, shouting expression is positioned in the center of the frame, captured in a sliding pose on a vibrant green soccer pitch under bright lighting. He wears a white and black sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" on the front, layered over a black long-sleeved undershirt, white shorts with black details, black compression leggings, and purple stripes on his undershirt and leggings. The scene begins with the camera performing a very smooth, two-part zoom out. It starts with a rapid zoom out, creating a sudden expansion of the surrounding space, and then transitions to a slower zoom out, gradually widening the field of view. As the camera zooms out, the character slides across the green field, kicking up a splash of water visible in the bottom right of the frame, originating from his slide. He simultaneously extends his right leg high into the air, striking a classic black and white soccer ball with the sole of his cleated shoe. The soccer ball is located in the foreground at the top left, positioned next to the character's raised foot. The background, filling the top and sides of the frame, is composed of blurred white and grey lines, indicating the speed and force of the kick. This is a 2D video, and the dynamic sliding motion and the splash of water emphasize the fast-paced action on the wet turf.",

    "Scene": "This animated scene takes place outdoors on a vibrant green soccer pitch under bright lighting. A character is shown in a dynamic sliding motion, kicking up a splash of water from the wet turf. A black-and-white soccer ball is in the air, having just been struck. The background is an abstract blur of white and grey speed lines, indicating fast movement across the field.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, an anime character is positioned in the center of the frame, captured in a sliding pose on a green field that occupies the bottom portion of the frame. A soccer ball is located in the foreground at the top left, positioned next to the character's raised foot. A splash of water is visible in the bottom right of the frame, originating from the character's slide.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
