  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a standard eye-level height, presenting a greatly accelerated time-lapse of the bustling St. Mark's Square in Venice under a partly cloudy blue sky. The paved square fills the foreground and the bottom one-third of the frame, extending into the middle ground, alive with numerous tourists and locals walking in various directions, their long shadows stretching across the ground in the bright sunlight. Pigeons can also be seen on the ground among the people. Positioned centrally in the middle ground is the grand St. Mark's Basilica, an exemplary piece of Italo-Byzantine architecture with its intricate facade, multiple golden-topped domes, elaborate spires, and shimmering mosaics above its arched entrances. Scaffolding is present on an upper section of the basilica. To its right, the towering, solid brick structure of St. Mark's Campanile rises from the middle ground and extends beyond the top of the frame. Other historical buildings line the square in the middle ground on the left, while a construction crane is visible in the distant background on the left. The sky occupies the background at the top of the frame. The camera executes a complex movement, simultaneously moving forward, zooming out, panning right, and trucking left, keeping the entire scene in deep focus. This dynamic perspective successfully captures the overall atmosphere, architectural grandeur, and vibrant energy of this iconic public space, making the environment itself the focus.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
