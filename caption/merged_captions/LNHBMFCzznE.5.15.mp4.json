  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair standing on an elevated stage in the top left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. The woman holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. In the background, a white, vertically slatted wall is visible behind her on the left, with the number \"1733\" visible on its side, and a stack of blue-lit circular objects is to her left, creating a honeycomb-like pattern. The audience, seen as silhouettes, occupies the foreground, filling the bottom and right portions of the frame, seated in the dark and illuminated by the blue light from the stage. A white couch is situated in the middle ground on the far right, adjacent to the audience. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, and remains static before performing a smooth, minor pan from right to left. The scene is set in a dark auditorium, viewed from the perspective of the audience looking toward the raised stage, where the woman stands on a bright red rectangular carpet at the center of the stage. The rest of the auditorium is dimly lit, with the audience visible only as dark silhouettes in their seats.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair, who is standing on a stage and speaking. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. She holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. The stage she stands on is elevated and covered with a square red carpet. In the foreground, seated in the dark, is the audience, visible primarily as silhouettes illuminated by the blue light from the stage. They are positioned below the stage and are watching the woman speak.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a red carpet on an elevated stage, holding a microphone in her right hand. As she speaks, she raises and gestures with her left hand. The audience, visible as silhouettes in the foreground, remains seated and still, watching her presentation.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark auditorium, viewed from the perspective of the audience looking toward a raised stage. A woman in a black dress stands on a bright red rectangular carpet at the center of the stage. The background features a white, vertically slatted wall structure illuminated in blue, with the number \"1733\" visible on its side. To the right of this wall is a decorative stack of circular objects, also lit in blue, creating a honeycomb-like pattern. The rest of the auditorium is dimly lit, with the audience visible only as dark silhouettes in their seats, and a white couch can be seen on the right side of the seating area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
