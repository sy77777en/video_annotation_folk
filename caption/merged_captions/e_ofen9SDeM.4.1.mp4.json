  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, where an older woman with fair skin and greyish-blonde hair, wearing a colorful patterned headscarf tied under her chin, a light grey cardigan over a dark, patterned dress, and a dark bag hanging at her elbow, is positioned in the middle ground, center, behind a weathered wooden gate that occupies the foreground, center. She holds a large, open umbrella with dark edges and a light-colored, intricate pattern in her right hand. In the background, center-left, an older man with a white beard, wearing a dark shirt and holding a hunting rifle, stands in the doorway of a stone building, appearing to look towards the woman. The landscape is lush with tall green grass and rolling hills, suggesting a serene countryside environment. As the woman begins to open the gate with her left hand and walk forward, she moves from the middle ground towards the foreground, approaching the camera. The eye-level camera maintains a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the midground, tracking the woman as she moves closer. The very unsteady camera is at first static with noticeable shaking, then tilts up slightly to focus on the woman's face as she moves closer. The shot transitions to a close-up of the woman, now in the foreground, center, still holding her umbrella. The wooden gate remains partially visible in the middle ground, right, while the man and the stone building are in the background, center-right and left respectively. The overall atmosphere is calm, with soft natural lighting and a gentle breeze indicated by the slight movement of the grass.",

    "Camera": "The eye-level camera maintains a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field.

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a rural area during the daytime, featuring a wooden gate reminiscent of a courtyard fence prominently in the foreground. In the background, a stone cottage with weathered walls adds to the rustic charm of the setting. The landscape is lush with tall green grass and rolling hills, suggesting a serene countryside environment. An elderly man stands still in front of the stone cottage, while a woman stands by the gate, holding a patterned umbrella with a light blue and white design. She wears a light-colored cardigan and a headscarf. The overall atmosphere is calm, with soft natural lighting and a gentle breeze indicated by the slight movement of the grass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
