  "merged_caption": "A black stick figure, depicted as a solid silhouette with a round head, a thin body, and large, blocky hands and feet, is initially positioned in the bottom left of the frame against a stark white background, representing an open outdoor space. Sparse, green, sketch-like tufts of grass are scattered along a thin, black horizontal line that delineates the ground. The figure crouches down from a standing position and then runs horizontally from the left to the right side of the frame, remaining in the bottom half. As the figure runs, a solid red, round ball appears on the ground in the bottom right, in its path. The camera smoothly tracks the stick figure from the side, moving rightward to follow its movement across the screen. The figure kicks the ball with its right foot, sending it off the top edge of the frame. The ball flies off-screen towards the top, then drops back down and bounces to about the middle height of the frame. After the kick, the figure stands relatively straight, stopping in the bottom center, looking up at the ball as it initially leaves the frame upwards, then looks back down as the ball returns.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly tracks the stick figure from the side, moving rightward to follow its movement across the screen.",
    "Subject": "A black stick figure, depicted as a solid silhouette with a round head, a thin body, and large, blocky hands and feet, is shown in various poses suggesting movement. It crouches, runs, and kicks a solid red, round ball that appears on the ground.",
    "Motion": "A black stick figure crouches down from a standing position and then runs to the right. As it runs, a red ball appears on the ground in its path. The figure kicks the ball with its right foot, causing the ball to fly off-screen towards the top. The ball then drops back down and bounces to about the middle height of the frame. After the kick, the figure stands relatively straight, looking up at the ball as it initially leaves the frame upwards, then looks back down as the ball returns.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set against a stark white background, representing an open outdoor space. A thin, black horizontal line delineates the ground, upon which sparse, green, sketch-like tufts of grass are scattered. In this minimalist, two-dimensional setting, a black stick figure runs across the screen, and a solid red ball appears.",
    "Spatial": "A black stick figure is initially positioned in the bottom left of the frame. The figure crouches and then runs horizontally from the left to the right side of the frame, remaining in the bottom half. A red ball appears in the bottom right, which the figure then kicks, sending it off the top edge of the frame. The figure subsequently stops in the bottom center. Sparse green grass tufts are scattered along a thin ground line across the bottom."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
