  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a grey and purple futuristic jet-like aircraft in the left middle ground, moving from left to right along a runway. The vehicle has a sleek body with wings, a tail fin, and a transparent cockpit canopy, adorned with magenta and pink accents. Inside the cockpit, a small brown and white dog is visible, wearing a pink helmet. Initially, a yellow and white dog, wearing a yellow outfit and carrying directional wands on its back, is clear in the left foreground but appears blurred due to the camera panning. The scene takes place outdoors during the day under a clear blue sky. The camera pans quickly and smoothly to the right from a level angle, tracking the jet as it accelerates down the dark runway marked with yellow lines, situated on the deck of a massive red and grey vessel moving through the water. The jet speeds rapidly along the runway, leaving a trail of steam in its wake as it moves toward the end of the platform. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as the animated jet moves away and becomes smaller in the frame. The camera transitions to an extreme wide shot, where the massive red vessel and its runway dominate the scene, stretching from the bottom left foreground to the right middle ground. The jet, now a small element, continues moving rightward in the middle ground, while a large, modern city with a dense skyline of numerous tall, sleek skyscrapers occupies the background across the top of the frame. The aircraft creates motion blur and leaves a trail of smoke as it speeds along the vessel's deck. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the dynamic motion and expansive environment.",

    "Camera": "In this animated scene, the camera pans quickly and smoothly to the right from a level angle, tracking a purple and grey jet as it speeds down a runway. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as the animated jet moves away and becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A grey and purple futuristic jet-like aircraft is depicted. The vehicle has a sleek body with wings, a tail fin, and a transparent cockpit canopy. Magenta and pink accents adorn the wings, tail, and the area around the cockpit. The aircraft is equipped with landing gear, including wheels at the front and back. Inside the cockpit, a small brown and white dog is visible, wearing a pink helmet. Initially, there is a yellow and white dog on the runway, wearing a yellow outfit and carrying directional wands on its back.",
    "Motion": "A grey and purple jet, with a dog visible in the cockpit, begins to accelerate down a runway. A yellow dog, blurred by motion, is briefly seen in the foreground. The jet then speeds rapidly along the runway, which is situated on a large, red, ship-like structure, leaving a trail of steam in its wake as it moves toward the end of the platform.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day under a clear blue sky. A futuristic, grey and purple aircraft with pink accents accelerates down a dark runway marked with yellow lines. This runway is on the deck of a massive red and grey vessel, which is moving through the water. In the background, across the water, stands a large, modern city with a dense skyline of numerous tall, sleek skyscrapers. The aircraft creates motion blur and leaves a trail of smoke as it speeds along the vessel's deck.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
