  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a serval, a medium-sized wild cat with a slender build, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, surrounded by tall grass in the foreground and background. The serval is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow coat adorned with black spots and stripes, large rounded ears marked with black and white patterns, a short muzzle, prominent whiskers, dark-colored eyes, a black nose, and a distinctive dark tear stain pattern. The grassy savanna environment, captured during daylight, features tall, dry grass with a mix of green and brown hues, creating a natural backdrop. The serval is initially seen in profile looking toward the right, its ears perked up and alert, then it turns its head to face the camera, maintaining a focused and alert posture. The camera is at eye level, initially at a level angle, then shifts to a high angle, using a shallow depth of field focused on the midground, specifically on the serval. The handheld camera pans slightly left as the serval turns, then tilts down with a slight pan right to track its movement. The motion is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The shot then changes to a medium shot, revealing more of the serval's upper body as it remains in the center. The serval turns its head away again, looking down and to the right, before turning completely away to show the back of its head as it moves slightly deeper into the middle-ground grass. The serval's posture and orientation suggest attentiveness, possibly indicating it is on the lookout or listening intently, blending into its natural habitat, which highlights its camouflage abilities.",

    "Subject": "The video features a serval, a medium-sized wild cat with a slender build. The serval is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow coat adorned with black spots and stripes. Its large, rounded ears are marked with black and white patterns, enhancing its acute hearing. The serval's face is marked by a short muzzle, prominent whiskers, dark-colored eyes, a black nose, and a distinctive dark tear stain pattern. It is seen amidst tall grass, blending into its natural habitat, which highlights its camouflage abilities. The serval's posture and orientation suggest attentiveness, possibly indicating it is on the lookout or listening intently.",
    "Motion": "The serval, with its distinctive spotted and striped fur, is seen in a grassy environment. It initially looks forward towards the right side of the frame, its ears perked up and alert. The serval then turns its head to its right to face the camera, maintaining a focused and alert posture. After a brief moment, the serval lowers its head and begins to move forward into the tall grass.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a grassy savanna environment during daylight. The setting features tall, dry grass with a mix of green and brown hues, creating a natural backdrop. The grass is dense, with some blades partially obscuring the view. A serval, characterized by its spotted coat and large ears, is present, blending into the surroundings. The serval's fur is a mix of tan and black, with distinctive spots and markings. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural habitat and the serval's integration into it.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up of a serval positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, surrounded by tall grass in the foreground and background. The serval is initially seen in profile looking toward the right, then it turns its head to face the camera. The shot then changes to a medium shot, revealing more of the serval's upper body as it remains in the center. The serval turns its head away again, looking down and to the right, before turning completely away to show the back of its head as it moves slightly deeper into the middle-ground grass. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
