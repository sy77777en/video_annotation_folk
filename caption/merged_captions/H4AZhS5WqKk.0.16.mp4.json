  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene is framed from an exterior perspective, focusing on the exterior of a high-rise building in a bustling city at night. The camera moves forward quickly and smoothly in the first second to frame a lit apartment window, revealing an animated, anthropomorphic mouse standing on the windowsill. The mouse, with large ears, a small nose, and a tail, is positioned between a bowl of green olives on the bottom-center-left and a tall goblet containing a clear liquid on the bottom-center-right. The setting is an urban nighttime scene, with a view of a dimly lit apartment exterior, where one window glows warmly, contrasting with the dark facade. The cityscape in the background is illuminated by numerous lights from other buildings, indicating a lively urban environment. It appears to be raining outside, with occasional lightning illuminating the scene. The camera, shot from a level angle, shifts focus from deep to a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground sharp while blurring the background, then remains static for the rest of the video. The mouse holds a skewer of olives in its right hand and sniffs them, then tosses them into the air directly above its head before eating them, with the olives moving from the lower center, up into the upper center of the frame, and back down. Initially, the mouse faces sideways to the camera and only turns to face the viewer at the end, looking forward with a surprised expression. The mouse's alert expression and atypical, cartoon-like appearance are the main focus. The interior of the apartment is visible in the background, with a cozy interior featuring a bed and a small table.",

    "Camera": "Shot from a level angle, the camera moves forward quickly and smoothly in the first second to frame an apartment window and a mouse on the ledge. As the camera moves, the focus shifts from deep to a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground sharp while blurring the background. The camera then remains static for the rest of the video.",
    "Subject": "The video features an animated mouse standing on a windowsill. The mouse is anthropomorphic, with large ears, a small nose, and a tail, holding a stick in one hand. It is positioned between a bowl of green olives and a tall goblet containing a clear liquid. Initially, the mouse faces sideways to the camera and only turns to face the viewer at the end. The mouse's expression is alert, and its atypical, cartoon-like appearance is the main focus.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward quickly to a lit window in a cityscape at night, revealing a mouse inside the room. The mouse, holding a stick of olives, begins to sniff the olives in its hand. After sniffing, the mouse throws the olives into the air, and they drop into its mouth one by one. Finally, the mouse looks forward with a surprised expression.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an urban nighttime scene, focusing on a high-rise building in a bustling city. The setting is with a view of a dimly lit apartment exterior, where one window glows warmly, contrasting with the dark facade. The cityscape in the background is illuminated by numerous lights from other buildings, indicating a lively urban environment. Inside the lit apartment, visible through the window, is a cozy interior with a bed and a small table. A glass and some green olives are placed on the ledge. It appears to be raining outside, with occasional lightning illuminating the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, the scene is framed from an exterior perspective, focusing on the exterior of a high-rise building in a bustling city at first, then the camera quickly moves forward, looking through a dark window frame that occupies the foreground. In the middle ground, positioned on the windowsill in the bottom center of the frame, an animated mouse stands between a bowl of olives on the bottom-center-left and a coupe glass on the bottom-center-right. The interior of the apartment is visible in the background. The mouse holds a skewer of olives in its right hand and sniffs them, then tosses them into the air directly above its head before eating them, with the olives moving from the lower center, up into the upper center of the frame, and back down. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
