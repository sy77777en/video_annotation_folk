  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a sprawling urban landscape during sunset, captured from a drone POV. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the city, with noticeable fisheye distortion curving straight lines outward. Initially, the scene includes numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes filling the frame, with cranes positioned towards the top right and center, dominating the upper portion of the scene in the foreground and middle ground. The sky, painted with hues of pink and orange, forms the backdrop at the top of the frame. The video begins with a prominent construction crane in the foreground and high-rise buildings in the background. As the camera, at an aerial level with a level angle, smoothly moves forward, it executes a 90-degree left pan to adjust its direction, then continues forward in the new direction. The crane gradually shifts out of the frame, revealing more of the city's skyline and additional construction sites. The sky transitions from a mix of blue and orange hues to deeper shades of orange and pink as the sun sets. The camera continues to pan left, showing more buildings and construction cranes, with the city lights starting to turn on. The high-rise buildings are scattered throughout the frame, occupying the middle ground and background, with some structures appearing closer to the camera in the foreground. The transition from one side of the frame to the other is smooth, with the camera panning horizontally while keeping the same height and angle relative to the subjects. The video concludes with a broader view of the city, highlighting the illuminated buildings and the expansive sunset sky, capturing the dynamic and evolving nature of the urban environment as day transitions to night.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level with a level angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly captures the city at dusk, initially moving forward while executing a 90-degree left pan to adjust its direction, then continues forward in the new direction.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling urban environment at sunset with a focus on the skyline and the interplay of natural and artificial light. The scene includes numerous high-rise buildings, construction cranes, and a sky illuminated by the setting sun. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object, highlighting the expansive nature of the urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at sunset, featuring a prominent construction crane in the foreground and numerous high-rise buildings in the background. As the camera pans to the left and advances, the crane gradually shifts out of the frame, revealing more of the city's skyline and additional construction sites. The sky transitions from a mix of blue and orange hues to deeper shades of orange and pink as the sun sets.

    "Scene": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of an urban landscape at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The sky is a blend of soft pink and orange hues, indicating the time of day as evening. The buildings are primarily modern, with glass facades reflecting the warm colors of the sunset. Construction cranes are prominent, with their metallic structures silhouetted against the sky. The city is bustling, with visible streets and illuminated windows suggesting activity. The overall scene captures the dynamic and evolving nature of the urban environment as day transitions to night.",
    "Spatial": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a sprawling urban landscape during sunset. The camera captures the entire cityscape, with numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes filling the frame. Initially, the cranes are positioned towards the top right and center of the frame, dominating the upper portion of the scene in the foreground and middle ground. As the camera pans, the cranes shift from the right side to the left, maintaining their prominence in the foreground. The high-rise buildings are scattered throughout the frame, occupying the middle ground and background, with some structures appearing closer to the camera in the foreground. The sky, painted with hues of pink and orange, forms the backdrop, situated at the top of the frame. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the buildings and cranes, providing a comprehensive aerial view of the city. The transition from one side of the frame to the other is smooth, with the camera panning horizontally while keeping the same height and angle relative to the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
