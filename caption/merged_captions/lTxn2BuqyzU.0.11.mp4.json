  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot capturing the upper bodies of a young animated boy with light skin, short brown hair, and brown eyes, wearing a white shirt and a green vest, and the hand of an unseen person with light skin, likely wearing a green short-sleeved shirt. The boy is centrally positioned in the middle ground, seated at a table in a brightly lit room with pastel-colored walls, likely a medical or educational setting. Green tubes extend from his ears, and he faces forward with a calm expression. The hand enters from the right side of the frame in the foreground, gently wiping the boy's nose with a tissue. The background includes medical posters and part of a computer screen on the left side, indicating a clinical environment. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the child in the midground using a shallow depth of field. It moves slowly and smoothly upward, maintaining focus on the child without any shaking. The boy remains mostly stationary, but his expression changes slightly as the nose wiping continues, showing a mix of calm and slightly uncomfortable. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting daytime, with sunlight visible on the wall, adding to the brightness of the room. The table is simple, with a smooth surface, and a few papers are visible. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at the boy's level, ensuring both the boy and the hand remain the focal points throughout the video. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, maintaining a steady focus on the interaction between the boy and the hand, capturing a moment of calm and focused interaction.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
