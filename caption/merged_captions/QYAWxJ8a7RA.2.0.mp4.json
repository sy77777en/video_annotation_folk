  "merged_caption": "In this full shot, a large pile of grey, textured sacks resembling burlap is positioned in the bottom left foreground of a desaturated, sepia-toned, desolate landscape with a dusty brown ground. In the center-right middle ground, a small, child-like figure, rendered in a dark, geometric style, stands with arms crossed over the edge of a single open sack. Behind this child, a group of three taller, adult-like figures, also portrayed in a dark, geometric style, stands close together in the right middle ground, while two other tall, dark, stylized figures stand in the left middle ground. All figures are depicted as dark, angular silhouettes without discernible features, clothing details, or expressions. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, performing a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc around the scene, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the figures and sacks in the midground in focus. The stylized human figures and sacks remain completely stationary as the camera subtly pans to the left, enhancing the scene's static and contemplative nature. An overlay of white text subtitles at the bottom left corner reads, “[9,10,12].”",

    "Camera": "This is a level, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the figures and sacks in the midground in focus. The camera performs a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc around the scene.",
    "Subject": "In a desaturated, sepia-toned scene, several stylized, low-polygon human figures are gathered around sacks. In the foreground, a large pile of grey, textured sacks, resembling burlap, is stacked on the ground. To the right, a small, child-like figure, rendered in a dark, geometric style, stands with arms crossed over the edge of a single open sack. Behind this child, a group of three taller, adult-like figures, also portrayed in a dark, geometric style, stands close together. On the far left, two tall, dark, stylized figures stand together. All the figures are depicted without discernible features, clothing details, or expressions, presented as dark, angular silhouettes.",
    "Motion": "The stylized human figures and sacks in the scene remain completely stationary, while the camera subtly pans to the left and moves in a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around the scene.",
    "Scene": "In a desolate landscape with a dusty brown ground, a pile of grey, textured sacks rests in the foreground, with one sack standing upright and open. In the middle ground, a group of dark, stylized, low-polygon human figures stand together, with a smaller figure positioned by the open sack. An overlay of white text subtitles at the bottom left corner reads, “[9,10,12].”",
    "Spatial": "In this full shot, a large pile of sacks is positioned in the bottom left foreground. In the center-right middle ground, a small figure stands behind a single open sack. A group of three taller figures is located behind the small figure in the right middle ground, while two other tall figures stand in the left middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
