  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the subject's body occupies the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground, with their aged hands, wearing a black bracelet on the right forearm, holding a red brick in the bottom-center. Initially, the person holds the brick with both hands, rotating it to inspect its sides. In the middle ground, a green plastic bucket filled with a dark, wet mortar mixture, with a tool's orange handle sticking out, is positioned in the center-left, and a low, partially constructed red brick wall extends from the top-left toward the center. The person then moves towards this wall, switching to holding the brick with their left hand, indicating they are preparing to place it onto the wall. Concrete stairs are located in the top-right, with broken brick pieces scattered on the dusty concrete floor in the center-right. In the background, far below the concrete surface, green foliage is visible in the top-left quadrant. The scene unfolds on a dusty, unfinished concrete surface outdoors under daylight. The camera, positioned high and looking down at the scene from the subject's viewpoint, is unsteady and shot from a worker's eye-level, bird's-eye perspective. It uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp and quickly rolls counterclockwise as the worker turns and moves forward. The perspective looks down past a pair of hands holding a single red brick, towards the ground below where some green foliage is visible. The person is wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt and patterned purple shorts.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with brown skin is shown walking on a concrete surface. They are wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt and patterned purple shorts. Their aged hands, with a black bracelet on the right forearm, hold a rectangular red brick with the left hand. Nearby, a green plastic bucket is filled with a dark, wet mortar mixture, with a tool's orange handle sticking out. A low, partially constructed red brick wall stands to the side, and broken brick fragments are scattered on the dusty concrete floor.",

They then move towards a low, partially constructed red brick wall and switch to holding the brick with their left hand, indicating they are preparing to place it onto the wall.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene unfolds on a dusty, unfinished concrete surface outdoors under daylight. A low, partially constructed wall of red-orange bricks and gray mortar stands nearby, with loose bricks and fragments scattered on the ground. Next to the wall, concrete stairs lead upward. A green plastic bucket holds a mixture of wet, dark gray mortar. The perspective looks down past a pair of hands holding a single red brick, towards the ground below where some green foliage is visible. The person is wearing a light-colored shirt and patterned pants.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
