  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a man in a red jacket with black accents on the left and a man in a blue shirt and beige apron on the right, both positioned in the foreground. A large, open delivery bag, red with black trim and a silver, insulated interior, is centered between them. The man in the red jacket holds the insulated delivery bag open with both hands while the man in the blue shirt and apron places items, including pots, into it. In the background, a white refrigerator stands on the right, with a metal counter holding a digital scale to its far right. The camera, set at a high-angle, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, focuses on both the men and the delivery bag in the foreground, making minor random movements while keeping the subjects centered in the frame. After the items are loaded, the man in the red jacket moves the lid, which has a white reflective stripe on its exterior, from an upright position to cover the central opening of the bag. He then turns and carries the bag toward the left side of the frame. Their actions suggest a collaborative effort, likely involving the preparation or transfer of items within the bag.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set to include both the men and the delivery bag in the foreground. The camera is slightly unsteady, making minor random movements while keeping the subjects centered in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features two men interacting with a red and black insulated delivery bag. The man on the left, wearing a red jacket with black accents, is holding the bag. The man on the right, dressed in a blue shirt and beige apron, is loading pots into the bag. Their actions suggest a collaborative effort, likely involving the preparation or transfer of items within the bag.",
    "Motion": "The man in the red jacket holds the insulated delivery bag open with both hands while the man in the blue shirt and apron places items into it. After the items are loaded, the man in the red jacket closes the lid and turns around.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor commercial space with a white refrigerator and a metal counter holding a digital scale, a man in a beige apron places items into a large, open delivery bag. The bag, held by a man in a red and black jacket, is red with black trim and has a silver, insulated interior. The man in the jacket then closes the lid of the bag, which has a white reflective stripe on its exterior.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a man in a red jacket on the left and a man in a blue shirt on the right, both positioned in the foreground. A large, open delivery bag is centered between them. The man on the right reaches into the bag, which is held steady by the man on the left. In the background, a refrigerator stands on the right, with a scale on a counter to its far right. The man in the red jacket then moves the lid from an upright position to cover the central opening of the bag, before turning and carrying the bag toward the left side of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
