  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing, point-of-view perspective on a fast-moving train traveling on elevated tracks through a dense urban environment. In the foreground and middle ground, a set of train tracks begins at the bottom of the frame and extends toward the center, initially appearing to end in the background but concluding in the middle ground as the train progresses toward the station. On the left and right sides, middle-ground urban buildings are heavily blurred, appearing as horizontal streaks due to the train's high speed and the time-lapse effect, which suggests a rapid forward journey. The camera is positioned at an eye-level, level angle and moves forward quickly along the tracks, with the movement being slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus is employed, keeping a large depth of field throughout the shot. In the background, more distant city buildings are positioned in the center of the frame, at the vanishing point of the tracks, with an overcast sky visible at the top. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, as if on an overground train, and moves rapidly forward, with the combination of the train's rapid movement and a time-lapse effect creating a radial motion blur that enhances the dynamic feel of the scene, affecting the elements on the periphery of the frame while the central background remains clearer. The metallic rails recede into the center of the view, leading toward more distant city buildings under an overcast sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the dynamic sensation of speed and the immersive atmosphere of traveling through a dense city rather than on any specific object or landmark.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video, played at a greatly accelerated speed, capturing a rapid forward journey. The camera is positioned at an eye-level, level angle and moves forward quickly along the tracks. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus is employed, keeping a large depth of field throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot captured from the point of view of a fast-moving train. The perspective looks forward along a set of tracks that converge in the distance, flanked by tall urban buildings that are heavily distorted by motion blur, creating streaks of light and color. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the dynamic sensation of speed and the immersive atmosphere of traveling through a dense city rather than on any specific object or landmark.",
    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view scenery shot from the front of a train traveling on elevated tracks through a city. The tracks stretch into the distance, flanked by tall buildings on both sides. The video is captured with a motion blur effect, which suggests a time-lapse effect and indicates that the train is moving at high speed.",
    "Scene": "From the perspective of a fast-moving train, the scene captures a forward view along a set of elevated tracks cutting through a dense urban environment. The metallic rails recede into the center of the view, leading toward more distant city buildings under an overcast sky. On either side, multi-story buildings are streaked into a significant motion blur, indicating high speed.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
