  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a wolf with predominantly grey and brown fur, featuring lighter patches on its chest and around its muzzle, lies in the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a small, grassy mound that extends across the bottom foreground. The wolf has pointed, upright ears and yellowish-brown eyes. The background is composed of a dense forest of tall, slender trees with green and yellow leaves, indicating an autumn setting. The camera is static at ground level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, with the focus set to include both the foreground and the midground where the wolf is resting. Initially, the wolf is oriented towards its back left side, but it quickly turns its head to face the camera, then turns back to its back left side before finally looking forward. The wolf remains stationary, lying down, but briefly shakes its head and turns it from side to side. The sunlit forest during the daytime provides a natural, earthy setting as the wolf looks around its wooded surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The camera is static at ground level, maintaining a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set to include both the foreground and the midground where the wolf is resting.",
    "Subject": "A wolf with predominantly grey and brown fur, featuring lighter patches on its chest and around its muzzle, is lying down on a small mound covered in green grass. The wolf has pointed, upright ears and yellowish-brown eyes. It is primarily oriented towards its back left side, but occasionally it briefly turns its head towards the viewer, looks forward, or gives a slight shake.",
    "Motion": "A wolf lies curled up on a grassy mound, initially looking toward its back left side. It quickly turns its head to face the camera, then turns back to its back left side before finally looking forward, remaining still for the rest of the clip.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit forest during the daytime, a gray wolf with thick fur lies on a small mound covered in green grass. The background consists of a dense stand of tall, slender trees with green and yellow leaves, indicating an autumn setting. The wolf, resting on the earthy ground, shakes its head and looks around its wooded surroundings.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a wolf lies in the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a small, grassy mound that extends across the bottom foreground. The background is composed of a dense forest of trees. The wolf remains stationary, lying down, but briefly shakes its head and turns it from side to side. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
