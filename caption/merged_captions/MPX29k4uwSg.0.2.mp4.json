  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot of a snowy, rural landscape during the daytime under an overcast sky. The scene is framed by out-of-focus tree trunks in the foreground, with two on the left and one on the right, creating a natural window through which the rest of the landscape is viewed. The camera is static but slightly unsteady, maintaining a level, eye-level perspective. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the barn in the background in focus while some of the closest trees in the foreground are blurred. In the middle ground, a single wooden post stands in the snow-covered landscape, which stretches from the foreground to the background. The central focus of the background is a large, weathered wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof and log walls, positioned in the center of the frame. To the right of the barn, a rustic wooden corral is partially visible. A smaller, attached section of the barn has its roof covered in snow. Some dry grasses poke through the snow-covered ground, which extends from the foreground all the way to the background. The entire landscape is blanketed in thick snow, conveying a sense of quiet, cold desolation and the stillness of a winter's day. The barn is framed between two tree trunks in the foreground, with the trunk further from the camera being more distinct, while the one closer is somewhat blurred. On the right side, another tree is very blurry. The camera remains completely still, capturing the quiet and cold atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the stark, monochromatic environment.",

    "Subject": "This is a rural scenery shot depicting a weathered, wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof set against a flat, white, overcast sky. The entire landscape is blanketed in thick snow, with a smaller, attached section of the barn also topped with a layer of white. To the right of the main structure, a rustic wooden corral stands partially visible. The scene is framed by three tree trunks in the foreground. On the left, there are two trunks, one in front of the other; the farther trunk is forked and relatively clear, while the closer one is more blurred. On the right side, there is another very blurred tree. This framing and the stark, monochromatic environment create a composition focused on conveying a sense of quiet, cold desolation and the stillness of a winter's day.",

    "Scene": "A snowy, rural landscape is seen during the daytime under an overcast sky. The scene is framed by three dark, leafless tree trunks in the foreground. On the left, two trees are positioned one in front of the other; the trunk further from the camera is more distinct, while the one closer is somewhat blurred. On the right side, another tree is very blurry. In the middle ground, a wooden post stands in the snow. In the background, a large, weathered wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof and log walls stands in a field of white snow. A smaller, attached section of the barn has its roof covered in snow. Adjacent to the structure is a wooden corral, and some dry grasses poke through the snow-covered ground, which extends from the foreground all the way to the background.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide, static scenery shot. The scene is framed by out-of-focus tree trunks in the foreground, with two on the left and one on the right, creating a natural window through which the rest of the landscape is viewed. In the middle ground, a single wooden post stands in the snow-covered landscape, which stretches from the foreground to the background. The central focus of the background is a large, weathered wooden barn, positioned in the center of the frame. To the right of the barn, a wooden corral is partially visible. The camera remains stationary at what appears to be eye level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
