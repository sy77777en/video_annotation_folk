  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the shot starts inside a wooden tower, with a door frame in the left foreground and an orange supply box held in the bottom right foreground. Through the central doorway, a mountainous landscape is visible in the background. The camera initially tilts up and pans left to a level angle, revealing an interior wall with an orange \"PARADISE\" sign, a small photo of a raccoon, and a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster. The view then moves slightly forward, transitioning from inside the lookout tower to its surrounding wooden balcony. The camera pans right and tilts down to a high angle to follow the wooden balcony, concluding with another slight forward movement. The final framing shows the wooden balcony railing extending from the foreground into the middleground, with the exterior of the tower on the right. The expansive, silhouetted forest and mountain range occupy the background, under a hazy, golden sky at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is filled with silhouetted pine trees and layered mountain ranges fading into the distance. An orange container with its lid propped open is being picked up in the foreground of the lower right corner. Two overlays are present: a green banner with white text that reads \"#48\" and a light blue banner with white text that reads \"Firewatch | 2016.\" The slightly unsteady, high-angle shot is captured from an eye-level perspective with a deep focus, and as the camera moves, the interior elements recede. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden-yellow light, with layers of silhouetted mountains and dark coniferous trees seen from the wooden balcony with a railing.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective inside a wooden fire lookout tower, a vast, mountainous landscape is visible at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden-yellow light, with layers of silhouetted mountains and dark coniferous trees seen from a wooden balcony with a railing. On an interior wall, an orange sign with the word \"PARADISE\" in black letters hangs to the left of a small, square picture of a raccoon. To the right is a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster featuring a shield emblem with a tower silhouette. In the foreground, a portion of an orange supply box with a small, angled lid is held by dark straps.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a first-person perspective, where an orange supply box with a small, angled lid is picked up. The view then tilts upward and pans left from inside a lookout tower, revealing a wooden balcony that overlooks a mountainous, tree-filled landscape at sunset. The camera moves forward along the balcony, pans right, and tilts downward to capture a high-angle view of the wooden balcony, concluding with a slight forward movement.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves from inside a wooden lookout tower out onto its surrounding balcony. The interior wall has an orange \"PARADISE\" sign, a small photo of a raccoon, and a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster. The view from the wooden balcony reveals a vast, mountainous forest landscape under a hazy, golden sky at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is filled with silhouetted pine trees and layered mountain ranges fading into the distance.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
