  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, showing a group of five motorcycles in a V-formation riding towards the foreground. The main, yellow-accented motorcycle is positioned in the center of the frame, with two red-accented motorcycles on its left and two on its right. Initially, the four motorcycles are positioned on the left and right sides, but they eventually move further to the left and right, respectively. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, moves backward to track the approaching motorcycles from the front. The main subject is a person riding a futuristic, sleek black motorcycle with glowing yellow-orange lines, clad in a matching black suit and full-face helmet with the same glowing strips. Flanking this central figure are four other riders on nearly identical motorcycles with red-orange accents. The motorcycles accelerate forward in a large, dark indoor stadium at night, racing at high speed in parallel lanes on a wide, black, reflective surface marked with glowing blue-green lines. The camera cranes up to a medium shot of the central rider, who remains in the center of the frame, then shifts to a high-angle view as it transitions to an extreme wide shot, looking down on the race. From this vantage point, the main subject speeds down the center of the track away from the camera, while the other four motorcycles race on the left and right sides, all moving from the middle ground toward the background. The camera performs a clockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle and seamlessly transitioning into a tail-tracking shot of the motorcycles. The arena's tiered seating and structural elements are illuminated by cool blue lights, with a single, thin, curved light suspended overhead. The entire sequence is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video features dynamic and smooth camera work that follows a group of futuristic motorcycles. The shot begins at hip level, moving backward to track the approaching motorcycles from the front. The camera then cranes up to an overhead, bird's-eye view before craning back down. As it descends, it performs a clockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle and seamlessly transitioning into a tail-tracking shot of the motorcycles. The entire sequence is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a person riding a futuristic, sleek black motorcycle with glowing yellow-orange lines accentuating its form. The rider is clad in a matching black suit and a full-face helmet, both of which are also detailed with the same yellow-orange glowing strips. The motorcycle features two bright white rectangular headlights. Flanking this central figure are four other riders on nearly identical motorcycles; however, their vehicles and suits are distinguished by glowing red-orange accents. The group is shown first in a V-formation with the yellow-accented motorcycle at the front, and then racing at high speed, leaving behind solid walls of light that match the color of their respective accents.",
    "Motion": "A group of five motorcycles, initially arranged in a stationary V-formation, accelerates forward in a large arena. The lead motorcycle, highlighted with yellow-orange light, moves ahead, while four others with red-orange accents follow. The motorcycles then race at high speed in parallel lanes, each leaving a solid wall of light in its wake that corresponds to its accent color.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed race within a vast, dark indoor stadium at night. The arena's track is a wide, black, reflective surface marked with glowing blue-green lines. In the background, tiered seating and structural elements are illuminated by cool blue lights, with a single, thin, curved light suspended overhead. Sleek, futuristic motorcycles, one with yellow accents and others with red-orange accents, speed along the track, leaving behind solid, glowing trails of light in their respective colors. The camera's perspective shifts, following the vehicles and providing high-angle views of the race in progress.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
