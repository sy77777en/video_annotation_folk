  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot frames five men standing in a horizontal line across the foreground in a police lineup, set indoors in a brightly lit room with a plain white wall. From left to right, the first man is on the far left, with a receding hairline, a dark beard, and a gray satin jacket with a strap on the right side. The second man, left of center, has short brown hair, a beard, and wears a black leather trench coat over a black turtleneck. The third man, in the center, has dark, styled hair and wears a black suit over an unbuttoned, bright red shirt. The fourth man, right of center, has dark, wavy hair, wears a light blue shirt and tie, and holds a beige jacket, which he lifts to cover his face. The fifth man, on the far right, is balding, wears a salmon-patterned shirt under a blue sweater vest, and looks down with his hands clasped. A black height chart is visible in the background, featuring horizontal lines and stenciled numbers marking height in feet and inches, from three feet up to over six feet, positioned directly behind the line of men. The camera remains static, slightly unsteady, and is positioned at the subjects' level, using a deep focus to keep all five men sharp and in view. At one point, the second and fifth men briefly glance at the fourth man, while the other men remain stationary throughout the clip.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a brightly lit room with a plain white wall. A black height chart is painted on the wall, featuring horizontal lines and stenciled numbers that mark height in feet and inches, from three feet up to over six feet. Five men stand in a line against this chart, wearing a variety of clothes, including a gray jacket, a black leather coat, a black suit with a red shirt, a light-colored suit, and a blue vest. One man holds a tan jacket, while another holds a small yellow paper.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
