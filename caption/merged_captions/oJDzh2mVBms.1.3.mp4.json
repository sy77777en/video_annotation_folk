  "merged_caption": "The video showcases the night sky as a backdrop, with a large, soft formation of green light initially occupying the bottom left and central portions of the frame, extending diagonally toward the top right. The camera remains stationary, capturing a static shot of the aurora borealis. As the video progresses, the vibrant green lights of the Aurora Borealis swirl and shift across the dark night sky. The ethereal, curtain-like formations move in a fluid, dancing motion, continuously changing their amorphous shapes. The intensity of the light fluctuates as the ribbons flow and undulate. A bright, concentrated ribbon of green light moves from the left side of the frame, sweeping across the center and then shifting upwards. The amorphous shapes of light continuously swirl and change, expanding and contracting to fill different areas of the frame against the dark sky. The phenomenon manifests as large, ethereal curtains and ribbons of vibrant green light that swirl and shift in fluid, amorphous shapes. The intensity of the green color varies, ranging from bright, luminous sections to more subdued, darker green areas. Visible in the dark background behind the aurora are numerous tiny, faint white specks, which are stars. The dynamic display of the aurora borealis forms fluid, curtain-like patterns against a backdrop of a clear, dark sky dotted with distant stars.",

    "Scene": "A view of the night sky is filled with the dynamic display of the aurora borealis. Vibrant, glowing green lights swirl and dance across the dark expanse, shifting in shape and intensity. The lights form fluid, curtain-like patterns against a backdrop of a clear, dark sky dotted with distant stars.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
