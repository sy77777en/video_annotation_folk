  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a serene landscape, capturing an expansive, open field with patches of dry, golden grass and scattered pools of water. The field stretches from the foreground to the middle ground, with water primarily in the center and slightly towards the bottom of the frame. The dry grass extends from the bottom left to the bottom right. The horizon line, marked by a row of bare trees, is positioned near the lower third and middle of the frame, effectively separating the field from the sky. These trees span horizontally across the middle ground, from the left to the right side of the frame. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, dominates the top half of the frame, providing a backdrop to the entire scene. The camera is shot at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It remains fixed with minimal shaking, capturing the landscape scene consistently. A person is seen walking from the center right of the frame towards the right, gradually moving further away from the camera, adding a subtle dynamic element to the otherwise calm and quiet atmosphere. The sky is mostly cloudy, with visible patches of blue peeking through, and the line of leafless trees in the background suggests a possible winter or early spring setting. The focus is on the overall mood and scale of the landscape, highlighting the serene and open nature of the scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at a height level with the field.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed with minimal shaking, capturing a landscape scene with a person in the distance.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures an expansive, open field with patches of water and dry, golden grass, creating a sense of vastness. The sky is filled with scattered clouds, adding depth and atmosphere. Bare trees line the horizon, emphasizing the natural environment. The focus is on the overall mood and scale of the landscape, rather than any specific object, highlighting the serene and open nature of the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a vast, open field with patches of dry grass and small puddles of water scattered across the ground. The sky is partly cloudy, with predominantly white clouds. In the background, there is a line of leafless trees, indicating a possible winter or early spring setting. A person is seen walking from the center right of the frame towards the right, gradually moving further away from the camera.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an expansive outdoor setting during the day, featuring a vast, open field with patches of dry, golden grass and scattered pools of water. The sky is mostly cloudy, with visible patches of blue peeking through the clouds. In the distance, a line of bare trees marks the edge of a forest, creating a stark contrast against the sky. The scene is calm, with subtle movement, capturing the serene and quiet atmosphere of the natural landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a serene landscape. The expansive field occupies the majority of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. Patches of water are scattered across the field, located primarily in the center and slightly towards the bottom of the frame. The dry, golden grass covers most of the field, extending from the bottom left to the bottom right. The horizon line, marked by a row of bare trees, is positioned near the lower third and middle of the frame, effectively separating the field from the sky. These trees span horizontally across the middle ground, from the left to the right side of the frame. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, dominates the top half of the frame, providing a backdrop to the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective at a height level with the field."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
