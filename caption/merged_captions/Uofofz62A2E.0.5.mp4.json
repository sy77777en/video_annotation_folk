  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide, level-angle fisheye shot, capturing a spacious, open-air European plaza during the daytime. A light-skinned man with short dark hair and some facial hair is on a skateboard, wearing a dark grey t-shirt, light-colored baggy pants, and white sneakers. He starts on the right side and moves towards the left, riding on a platform with three steps, his body slightly bent and arms relaxed at his sides. The camera, positioned at a level angle with deep focus, keeps the entire scene sharp, including a long, multi-story building with a classical facade of repeating arches and windows in the background under a bright, overcast sky. As the skateboarder reaches the edge of the platform, he spreads his arms and launches into the air. The camera shifts to a low angle, effectively capturing him mid-jump over a dark green, cylindrical trash can with stickers on its surface, one of which shows a close-up of an eye, positioned at the base of concrete steps. The camera smoothly tracks his movement, panning from right to left and tilting up and down, while also rolling to create a varying Dutch angle. At the peak of the jump, he is briefly suspended in the center of the frame before landing smoothly. Once he lands, the camera smoothly returns to a level angle as he continues moving towards the open square, revealing more of the mid-ground European-style open square, the multi-story buildings in the background, and the trash can in the foreground. By the end of the video, he is positioned in the midground near the upper left of the frame, with a dark, weathered statue of a person standing on a large concrete base with graffiti visible to the right.",

    "Camera": "Shot with a fisheye lens, the video features noticeable distortion. Initially, the camera is positioned at a level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. As the male skateboarder launches into the air, the camera shifts to a low angle, effectively capturing him mid-jump over the trash bin. It smoothly tracks his movement, panning from right to left and tilting up and down, while also rolling to create a varying Dutch angle. Once he lands, the camera smoothly returns to a level angle.",

    "Motion": "A skateboarder rides on a platform with three steps, his body slightly bent and arms relaxed at his sides. As he reaches the edge, he spreads his arms and launches into the air, clearing a dark green trash bin in front of the platform. He lands smoothly and continues to skate forward.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a level camera angle, capturing a spacious, open-air European plaza during the daytime. A long, multi-story building with a classical facade of repeating arches and windows forms the background under a bright, overcast sky. In the mid-ground to the right, a large gray stone monument base with a statue on top is visible. As a person on a skateboard launches into the air, the camera shifts to a low-angle perspective, capturing them mid-jump over a dark green, cylindrical trash can with stickers on its surface, positioned at the base of concrete steps. Once the skateboarder lands and skates off to the left, the camera reverts to a level angle, revealing more of the mid-ground European-style open square, the multi-story buildings in the background, and the trash can in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide, level-angle fisheye shot, capturing a skateboarder starting on the right side and moving towards the left. As the skateboarder jumps, the camera angle shifts to a low perspective. At the peak of the jump, he is briefly suspended in the center of the frame before landing. The camera angle then returns to level as he continues moving towards the open square. By the end of the video, he is positioned in the midground near the upper left of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
