  "merged_caption": "This hand-drawn animation is presented in a medium shot, consistently showing a woman from her upper thigh up. She is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame against a beige background resembling yellowed sketch paper, with a pure white border. The animation begins with the woman appearing with her hair tied back, featuring bangs parted on both sides of her forehead and adorned with a small butterfly-shaped hairpin. She is dressed in a traditional Chinese outfit with a high collar and short sleeves, reminiscent of a qipao. As the scene progresses, she removes the butterfly-shaped hairpin with her left hand, allowing her hair to flow freely over her shoulders before it is suddenly tied back. Her facial features and makeup transition from an East Asian style to an Indian style, and she wears large hoop earrings. She then uses her right hand to drape a piece of fabric across her left shoulder. Her inner garment transforms into a short-sleeved, midriff-baring top, with a long piece of fabric draped over one shoulder and wrapped around her waist, resembling a sari. Finally, she adjusts the fabric, lifting the back part of the sari forward and upward with her left hand to fan it out, completing the transformation. Throughout the animation, as her attire and appearance transform, her body remains in the same spatial position. The primary movement within the frame occurs when she fans out a piece of her clothing, which expands from her central position toward the left side of the screen. This is a stop-motion animation with a stationary camera, consisting of a sequence of hand-drawn sketches that change frame by frame to create the illusion of movement.",

    "Subject": "A hand-drawn animation in blue pencil depicts the upper body of a woman undergoing a transformation in appearance and attire. Initially, she is shown with her hair tied back, bangs parted to both sides of her forehead, and adorned with a small butterfly-shaped hairpin. She is dressed in a traditional Chinese outfit with a high collar and short sleeves, resembling a qipao. The scene then shifts as her hair becomes medium-length and flows freely over her shoulders before being tied back again. Her facial features and makeup transition from an East Asian style to an Indian style, and she wears large hoop earrings. Her inner garment changes to a short-sleeved, midriff-baring top, with a long piece of fabric draped over one shoulder and wrapped around her waist, resembling a sari.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
