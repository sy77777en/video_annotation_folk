  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a vast industrial landscape, focusing on the immense scale of the environment rather than a specific subject. A massive, conical pile of dark material dominates the right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. Another large pile occupies the bottom left foreground. In the left middle ground, a simple building is positioned, with a smaller structure slightly behind it to the left. A tiny human figure stands in the bottom right middle ground, near the base of the large pile on the right. The entire scene is enclosed by towering rock walls in the background, with the camera positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scenery. The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly and slowly from left to right and upward, capturing the landscape and structures below. The scene is set within a vast, open-pit mine or quarry, enclosed by towering, rough-hewn rock walls predominantly situated behind and to the left of the weathered industrial buildings with gabled roofs. Immense, conical piles of dark, granular material, possibly coal or gravel, are positioned in front of both sides of the buildings. Due to their considerable height, only portions of these piles are visible within the frame. A series of utility poles with wires are scattered throughout the flat, dusty area. The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of browns and grays, under diffuse, even lighting. Two small human figures stand in front of the pile in the right middle ground and to the left of the building, starkly illustrating the immense scale of the environment.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a vast and desolate industrial landscape, likely depicting a quarry or mining operation inside a massive cavern. The scene features a prominent pile of dark, granular material in the left foreground, with another pile situated in the right middle ground. Enormous, conical piles of material dwarf the simple, weathered buildings and utility poles scattered across the dusty ground. A rough rock face is visible behind and to the left of one building, positioned in front of the towering, rough-hewn rock walls but behind the large conical piles. In the right foreground, another building is partially visible, with only its roof showing. Two small human figures stand in front of the pile in the right middle ground and to the left of the building, starkly illustrating the immense scale of the environment. The focus is on conveying the sheer size of the industrial operation and the somber, hazy atmosphere of the location, rather than on any specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "The video features a smooth and slow camera movement from left to right and upward, capturing a desolate landscape, likely a quarry or mine. The scene is dominated by large piles of gravel and a few small buildings.",

The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of browns and grays, under diffuse, even lighting. A lone, small human figure can be seen walking at the base of one of the massive piles, highlighting the enormous scale of the operation.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
