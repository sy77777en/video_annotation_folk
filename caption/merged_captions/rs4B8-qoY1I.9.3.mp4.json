  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a tilted overhead, isometric perspective, showcasing a theme park environment. A wooden roller coaster and its station buildings dominate the center-right, with tracks stretching toward the top right and bottom left corners. A large expanse of turquoise water fills the top left, top, and top-right areas of the frame, while patches of green trees are scattered throughout. The camera, representing the game view, follows the mouse movement, first trucking left and slightly downward, revealing a chairlift system with visible cables and towers running from the bottom left toward the center. The chairlift, with occupied chairs, travels from left to right across the water. Numerous small, pixelated human figures, dressed in brightly colored clothing, walk along the brown dirt paths, queuing for attractions and riding the various rides. As the shot progresses, a drink stall made from four cans—two green and two red—comes into view near the dirt path in the bottom left. The camera then shifts upward, bringing a red-and-white roller coaster into prominence across the top left and center, where the train is stationary, and people are visible in a queue line for this coaster and walking on nearby paths. A large building appears in the bottom left. Throughout, the camera maintains a consistent overhead, isometric viewpoint, creating a unified visual style. The landscape is characterized by green grassy areas and a variety of green trees, both coniferous and deciduous, bordering the attractions. The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking, ending with a truck to the right, providing a comprehensive view of the amusement park scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera, representing the game view, follows the mouse movement to showcase different scenes. It first trucks left, then moves downward and pauses for a second, followed by moving upward, and ends with a truck to the right. The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video displays an isometric view of a theme park, featuring several key elements. Prominent are wooden roller coasters with visible tracks, some accented with red and white, and trains carrying small, pixelated figures. Various buildings, constructed from wood and stone-like materials with grey or brown roofs, serve different functions, including ride stations. A chairlift system, with cables strung between tall, grey metal towers, transports people in chairs that accommodate two figures each over the park. Numerous small, pixelated human figures, dressed in a variety of brightly colored clothing, are seen walking on brown dirt paths, queuing for attractions, and riding the various rides. The landscape is dotted with green trees of conical and rounded shapes, and a significant portion of the scene is occupied by a large body of turquoise water. Other park details include a drink stall located next to the dirt path, made from four cans—two green and two red.",
    "Motion": "The camera dynamically moves across the amusement park scene, panning left, then shifting downward, upward, and rightward. A wooden roller coaster with brown supports has trains that are stopped on the tracks. Simultaneously, a chairlift with occupied chairs travels from left to right across the water. Numerous small figures representing people walk along pathways throughout the park. The camera then shifts its focus to a different roller coaster, this one white with red rails, where the train is stationary, and people are visible in a queue line for this coaster and walking on nearby paths.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows an amusement park environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene features a large roller coaster with red and white tracks and extensive support structures, winding through a forested area. Nearby, another wooden roller coaster is located close to several wooden buildings with grey, sloped roofs; one serves as an entrance to a ride, and others appear to be stations or themed structures. A chairlift system with metal towers transports small figures across the park, passing over a brown dirt path populated by numerous tiny figures. The landscape is characterized by green grassy areas and a variety of green trees, both coniferous and deciduous, bordering a large body of teal-colored water and the attractions. The chairlift cars are in motion, while the roller coasters are stationary, and people are visible walking along the paths.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
