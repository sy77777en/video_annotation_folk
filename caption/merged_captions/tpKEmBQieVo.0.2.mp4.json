  "merged_caption": "In a worm's eye angle close-up shot filmed from the subject's chest, a man with a beard is seen against a vast, clear blue sky during the daytime. He is wearing a bright yellow jumpsuit with blue and purple accents on the chest and a black helmet with reflective goggles, which he is adjusting by pulling them down over his eyes. His head is positioned in the middle ground of the frame, with his shoulders and torso occupying the bottom foreground. His hands are raised on either side of his head, positioned in the top left and top right corners, framing his face. The background consists of an uninterrupted expanse of blue, with a small black object seen falling from the sky to the right of the center. The video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between regular and slow motion, while a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The slightly shaky, eye-level shot captures the man's hands moving slightly as he adjusts the goggles on his helmet.",

    "Camera": "This slightly shaky, eye-level shot is filmed from a worm's-eye view angle, looking directly up at the man. The video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between regular and slow motion, while a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man with a beard is seen from a worm's eye angle. He is wearing a black helmet with reflective goggles, which he is adjusting by pulling them down over his eyes. He is dressed in a bright yellow jumpsuit with blue and purple accents on the chest. His hands are raised on either side of his head.",
    "Motion": "From a worm's eye angle perspective, a man uses both hands to pull his goggles down over his eyes.",
    "Scene": "From a worm's eye perspective looking directly up, a man with a beard is seen against a vast, clear blue sky during the daytime. He is wearing a bright yellow jacket with blue zippered accents and a black helmet with reflective goggles pushed up onto it. His hands are raised on either side of his head, framing his face. The background consists of an uninterrupted expanse of blue, with a small black object seen falling from the sky in the far distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
