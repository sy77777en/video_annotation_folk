  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man with dark, disheveled hair is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the foreground, while a large, bright fire occupies the left middle ground. The man, initially shown in profile facing the left side of the frame, is silhouetted against the flickering flames, which provide the primary illumination. The bright orange and yellow flames create a warm, orange-red rim light along his profile and the back of his head, while his face and front remain in deep shadow. He is wearing dark clothing, the details of which are obscured. The surrounding environment is obscured in darkness. The man slowly turns his head and upper body to face forward toward the camera, his features remaining hidden in the darkness. This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot from a level-angle, eye-level height perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, resulting in a large depth of field where the entire scene remains sharp. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot as the fire continues to burn.",

    "Scene": "In a dark setting at night, a person is silhouetted against a large, flickering fire. The bright orange and yellow flames on the left provide the primary illumination, casting the individual's features into deep shadow while creating a warm, glowing outline on their profile and hair. The surrounding environment is obscured in darkness. The person slowly turns their head toward the front as the fire continues to burn.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
