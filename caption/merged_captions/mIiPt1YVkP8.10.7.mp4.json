  "merged_caption": "The wide shot, captured at the subjects' level, initially frames a larger white commercial jet airplane in the left-middle ground on a runway and a smaller white commercial jet airplane in the right-middle ground on a parallel taxiway. Dark asphalt occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame, with runways, taxiways, and green grass situated in the middle ground, and hazy, blocky buildings visible in the distant background under a reddish-sepia sky. As the larger airplane takes off, ascending diagonally upwards and towards the right, the camera, at an aerial, level angle using deep focus, smoothly tracks horizontally to the right with a slight upward tilt to follow its movement. This camera movement causes the ascending airplane to shift from its initial left-middle ground position towards the center of the frame as it gains altitude, while the smaller, grounded airplane moves from the right-middle ground towards the center of the frame, taxiing forward in the same direction. Concurrently, the foreground dark asphalt reveals increasingly complex yellow taxiway markings, including lines and circular patterns, which enter from the right and move across the lower portion of the frame, occupying the foreground and lower-middle ground. The middle ground runways, grass, and the distant background buildings also shift leftwards relative to the frame due to the camera's rightward motion. The setting includes clearly demarcated runways and taxiways, and both aircraft are of a similar design, featuring swept-back wings and a distinct tail fin. In the distant background, indistinct, blocky silhouettes of buildings are visible through the haze, and as the camera moves to the right, following the movement of the ascending aircraft, some buildings become visible in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial, level angle, using deep focus. It smoothly tracks the airplanes taking off from the side, moving rightward with a slight upward tilt to follow them.",
    "Subject": "The video displays two white commercial jet airplanes at an airport. Both airplanes are depicted in the middleground. One airplane, larger and more prominent, is shown ascending from a runway, its nose pointed upwards as it gains altitude. Further in the distance, on a parallel runway or taxiway, a second, smaller white commercial jet airplane is visible on the ground. Both aircraft are of a similar design, featuring swept-back wings and a distinct tail fin. The setting includes clearly demarcated runways and taxiways.",
    "Motion": "A larger white airplane takes off from a runway, ascending and moving forward from left to right. Simultaneously, a smaller white airplane taxis forward on a parallel runway or taxiway in the same direction. The camera shifts to the right, following the ascending airplane.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an objective POV shot of an airport under a hazy, reddish-sepia sky. Two white airplanes are visible; one is in the process of taking off, ascending into the air, while a smaller one remains on the ground on a runway or taxiway. The airport features dark gray asphalt runways and taxiways marked with white and yellow lines, interspersed with patches of green grass. In the distant background, indistinct, blocky silhouettes of buildings are visible through the haze. As the camera moves to the right, following the movement of the ascending aircraft, some buildings become visible in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The wide shot, captured at the subjects' level, initially frames a larger airplane in the left-middle ground on a runway and a smaller airplane in the right-middle ground on a parallel taxiway. Dark asphalt occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame, with runways, taxiways, and green grass situated in the middle ground, and hazy, blocky buildings visible in the distant background under a reddish sky. As the larger airplane takes off, ascending diagonally upwards and towards the right, the camera tracks horizontally to the right to follow its movement. This camera movement causes the ascending airplane to shift from its initial left-middle ground position towards the center of the frame as it gains altitude, while the smaller, grounded airplane moves from the right-middle ground towards the center of the frame. Concurrently, the foreground dark asphalt reveals increasingly complex yellow taxiway markings, including lines and circular patterns, which enter from the right and move across the lower portion of the frame, occupying the foreground and lower-middle ground. The middle ground runways, grass, and the distant background buildings also shift leftwards relative to the frame due to the camera's rightward motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
