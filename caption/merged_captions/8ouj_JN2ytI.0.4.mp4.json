  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a group of American football players standing in two lines on the sideline of an outdoor stadium during the day. The players, wearing white jerseys with blue and green accents and \"RAPID CITY\" printed on their chests, are positioned from left to right across the frame, occupying the foreground and mid-ground. The man on the far left, wearing a white jersey with the number 91, is positioned at the left edge of the frame. Next to him, the player with the number 83 stands slightly to the right, followed by the player with a partially obscured number, showing only the digit '1', and then the player with a partially obscured number, showing only the digit '6'. These players hold blue helmets with a green and white logo on the side and maintain serious expressions, facing forward with slight movements. On the far right, a man in a blue hoodie stands at the edge of the frame. The camera is at the subjects' eye level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the line of players in sharp focus while blurring the crowd behind them. The stadium stands are visible in the background, filled with a large, blurred crowd of spectators predominantly wearing yellow, creating a sense of depth. The framing changes as the camera moves smoothly and slowly to the right, tracking along the line of players, revealing another player on the right while the player on the far left goes out of the frame.",

Beside him, another dark-skinned man with a blue headband wears a white jersey with the number 6, with the number also partially obscured by the left arm of the man to his left, allowing only the right half of the \"6\" to be seen.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
