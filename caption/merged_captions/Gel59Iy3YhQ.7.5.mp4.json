  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a video game character with a slender build and dark-colored hair is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a narrow ledge of a large, steep, dark gray rock cliff. The character, wearing white and brown clothing with a long, staff-like object on its back, is shown in mid-air, as if jumping or climbing between ledges. The cliff face fills the background and middle ground, with bright green foliage, including bushes with small white flowers and ferns, visible at the bottom, top left, and center-right of the frame. On a separate ledge to the right, also in the middle ground, are several small, dark, round objects and a single red, mushroom-like object. The environment is lit as if during the daytime. The camera, from a smooth, high aerial angle, trucks left, intermittently pausing to follow the character as it leaps through the air, moving from a rocky ledge on the right towards a rocky edge on the left. The character is suspended in mid-jump above a chasm, with its body angled towards the intended landing spot, remaining in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned above the character, looking down, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. An overlay at the bottom right of the screen displays the word \"Drop.\"",

    "Motion": "A video game character leaps through the air, moving from a rocky ledge on the right towards a rocky edge on the left. The character is suspended in mid-jump above a chasm, with its body angled towards the intended landing spot, though the video does not clearly indicate if the movement is from a lower to a higher position.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set on a steep, dark gray rock cliff face. Bright green foliage, including bushes with small white flowers and ferns, grows in patches from the crevices of the angular rocks. A character in white and blue attire, with the right arm appearing brown, performs a short jump along a narrow ledge. On a separate, higher ledge to the right, several small, dark, round objects and a single red mushroom are clustered together. The environment is lit as if during the daytime. An overlay at the bottom right of the screen displays the word \"Drop.\"",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a video game character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a narrow ledge of a large rock cliff. The cliff face fills the background and middle ground. Patches of green foliage are visible at the bottom, top left, and center-right of the frame. On a separate ledge to the right, also in the middle ground, are several small, dark objects and a single red object. The character performs a short jump to an adjacent ledge, remaining in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned above the character, looking down."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
