  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, a line of stylized, low-polygon human figures occupies the middle ground, stretching from the right side of the frame towards the left. The figures, all rendered in a uniform light gray, include several men and one woman. The woman, at the front of the line, wears a skirt and high heels. Behind her, five men, all approximately the same height and evenly spaced, stand still. From right to left, the sequence is as follows: a man with his arms crossed, a man carrying a shoulder bag, a taller man with his hands in his pockets, another man with his arms crossed, and a man wearing a hoodie with his hands in his pockets. At the front of the line, a tall, white, rectangular kiosk stands on a black base, featuring a large screen displaying a hamburger ordering service. The camera, in a very smooth, eye-level shot with mild barrel distortion, trucks left along the line of people, slowing its movement as it proceeds. As the camera captures the end of the line, a man enters the frame from the left, walks to the back of the line, then turns around and exits to the left. The other figures in the queue remain still as the camera continues its leftward movement. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground in focus. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"up to 70% leave\" in black font within a white box, alongside a small white overlay with the text \"[27]\". The minimalist, monochromatic indoor setting features a light gray tiled floor, enhancing the stylized appearance of the figures and the kiosk.",

    "Subject": "A line of stylized, low-polygon human figures stands on a tiled floor, waiting to use a kiosk. The figures, all rendered in a uniform light gray, include several men and one woman. The woman, at the front of the line, wears a skirt and high heels. Behind her, five men, all approximately the same height and evenly spaced, stand still. From right to left, the sequence is as follows: a man with his arms crossed, a man carrying a shoulder bag, a taller man with his hands in his pockets, another man with his arms crossed, and a man wearing a hoodie with his hands in his pockets. At the back of the line, another male figure walks to the end and then turns away from the queue. The white, rectangular kiosk at the head of the line stands on a black base and features a large screen displaying a hamburger ordering service. A white text box with the words \"up to 70% leave\" is visible in the lower-left corner.",
    "Motion": "A stylized, low-polygon figure walks to the end of a queue of other stationary figures. After a brief pause, the figure turns and walks away from the line. The other figures in the queue remain still as the camera slowly trucks to the left, following the length of the line.",
    "Scene": "In a minimalist, monochromatic indoor setting with a light gray tiled floor, a line of stylized, low-poly human figures waits. The figures, all rendered in shades of gray, stand facing a tall, white, rectangular kiosk at the front of the queue. The kiosk features a large white screen displaying a hamburger ordering service. During the scene, a figure at the end of the line steps back and turns away. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"up to 70% leave\" in black font within a white box, alongside a small white overlay with the text \"[27]\".",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, a line of stylized figures occupies the middle ground, stretching from the right side of the frame towards the left. As the camera trucks left, the frame captures the end of the line. A man enters the frame from the left, walks to the back of the line, then turns around and exits to the left. At the front of the line, a kiosk is positioned in the right middle ground. The other figures in the line and the kiosk remain stationary throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
