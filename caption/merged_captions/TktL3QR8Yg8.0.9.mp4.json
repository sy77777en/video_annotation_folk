  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's hands and forearms, positioned in the left and center of the frame, as they manipulate a hexagonal metal rod and nut. The hands, clad in a long-sleeved shirt in a beige-like color with dark vertical stripes, are shown turning and fastening the components together. The camera is fixed, slightly unsteady, and at eye level, utilizing an extremely shallow depth of field. Initially, the focus is on the metal construction in the midground, while the arm of the person in the foreground appears blurred. As the hands adjust and secure the pieces, assembling part of a metal structure, the perspective shifts. Once the arm exits the frame, the focus shifts, bringing the metal construction into clear view in the foreground. The camera remains at the same height as the model, which fills the center and left of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The larger object being constructed is revealed: a complex mechanical model made from silver-colored and red-painted metal strips, brackets, nuts, and bolts, characteristic of a construction set. This intricate structure consists of perforated metal pieces fastened together, forming part of what appears to be a model Ferris wheel or a similar elaborate machine. The structure includes suspended, swing-shaped components that are gently oscillating. The video takes place indoors in a warmly lit room with a blurred background that suggests a cozy, possibly vintage environment. The metal parts have a matte finish and a slightly worn texture, with some elements showing signs of use. The background remains out of focus and unchanged, with indistinct objects and soft lighting contributing to a calm, workshop-like atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.",

    "Subject": "The video opens on a close-up of a person's hands and arms, clad in a long-sleeved shirt in a beige-like color with dark vertical stripes, as they assemble a metal object. The hands are shown manipulating a hexagonal metal rod and a nut. The perspective then shifts to reveal the larger object being constructed: a complex mechanical model made from silver-colored and red-painted metal strips, brackets, nuts, and bolts, characteristic of a construction set.

    "Motion": "At the start of the video, a pair of hands manipulates a hexagonal metal rod and a nut, turning and fastening the components together. The hands adjust and secure the pieces, assembling part of a metal structure. As the hands exit the frame, the perspective shifts to reveal a section of a larger Ferris wheel-like construction. This structure includes suspended, swing-shaped components that are gently oscillating.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a warmly lit room with a blurred background that suggests a cozy, possibly vintage environment. The main focus is a mechanical structure made of metal beams and plates, featuring a combination of silver and reddish-brown components with visible bolts, nuts, and perforated holes. The metal parts have a matte finish and a slightly worn texture, with some elements showing signs of use. The structure is assembled with precision, and its geometric shapes include straight bars, triangular supports, and rectangular plates. In the background, indistinct objects and soft lighting contribute to a calm, workshop-like atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's hands and forearms, positioned in the left and center of the frame, as they manipulate a hexagonal metal rod and nut. The hands and arms are at the same height as the camera, which is level with the subject. The background is blurred, with indistinct objects and warm lighting visible in the middle ground and background, mostly toward the right side of the frame. The camera then shifts focus and framing to a close-up of the mechanical model, which fills the center and left of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The structure’s metal beams and plates are clearly visible, with the camera remaining at the same height as the model. Throughout the video, the spatial transition moves the main subject from the hands and arms on the left and center foreground to the mechanical model in the center and left foreground, while the background remains out of focus and unchanged."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
