  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a red diabolo, which is centered in the frame and situated in the middle ground. A person's dark clothing is partially visible on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, while the background consists of blurred greenery, suggesting a natural, possibly park-like area. The camera is in slow-motion with a slight high angle, providing a downward view of the red diabolo, and features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground while remaining completely static throughout. The diabolo, with a smooth, rounded shape and a central axle, is suspended by taut orange strings, indicating it is in motion or being manipulated. Initially, the diabolo already has some blue paint on its surface, creating an interesting visual contrast with the red. As the video progresses, the red diabolo spins in place, and blue paint smoothly drips from above onto its surface, splattering and spreading to create an intricate pattern. The paint splatter becomes more extensive, covering much of the diabolo, but some areas of red remain visible, resulting in a vibrant and colorful visual effect. The paint appears thick and glossy, partially covering the diabolo and adding a dynamic visual element. Streaks of paint fly outward from the center due to the rotational motion, enhancing the striking contrast. The scene is well-lit, indicating daytime, and the paint's motion adds a sense of energy and change to the otherwise static surroundings. The focus is on the interaction between the paint and the diabolo, highlighting the vivid colors and textures.",

    "Subject": "The video features a large, red diabolo with a smooth, rounded shape and a central axle, suspended by orange strings. Initially, the diabolo already has some blue paint on its surface, creating an interesting visual contrast with the red. As the video progresses, more blue paint is splattered onto the diabolo, enhancing the striking contrast.

    "Motion": "The video shows a red diabolo spinning as it is suspended by orange strings, with blue paint smoothly dripping from above onto its surface. The blue paint spreads, creating an intricate pattern on the diabolo. The paint splatter becomes more extensive, covering much of the diabolo, but some areas of red remain visible, resulting in a vibrant and colorful visual effect.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting with a focus on a vibrant red diabolo spinning in mid-air. The background features a blurred, lush green environment, suggesting a natural, possibly park-like area. The diabolo is suspended by strings, and its smooth, rounded shape is highlighted against the greenery. In the progression of the video, blue paint splatters across the diabolo, creating a dynamic contrast with its red surface. The scene is well-lit, indicating daytime, and the paint's motion adds a sense of energy and change to the otherwise static surroundings.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of a red diabolo, which is centered in the frame and situated in the middle ground. A person's dark clothing is partially visible on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, while the background consists of blurred greenery. The camera is positioned at the same height as the diabolo and remains static throughout the shot. As the diabolo spins in place, blue paint is splattered onto it, with streaks of paint flying outward from the center due to the rotational motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
