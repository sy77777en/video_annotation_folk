  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a middle-aged Black man with a bald head, short dark hair on the sides, and a dark mustache, positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. He is wearing a light pink, long-sleeved, button-up shirt and a ring on his left hand, with a small microphone positioned to his left of his mouth. In the background, a large screen displays a bright blue background with a black silhouette of a city skyline along the bottom, including a tall tower on the far right. The text \"TEDxRyersonU\" is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, while \"THINK FORWARD 2011\" is displayed in the bottom right corner. The camera is at an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, keeping both the speaker and the background screen sharp. As the man stands on the well-lit stage, he speaks and gestures with his left hand, raising it with his palm facing upward. He shifts to his right, corresponding to the left side of the frame, pauses, and then turns his body to his left, looking toward the right side of the frame. The camera smoothly pans left to track the speaker, pauses, and then pans left again slightly before remaining static with subtle shaking. The shot transitions into a medium close-up, repositioning him in the center of the screen. Throughout the video, he maintains an expressive facial expression while continuously gesturing with his left hand. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip, capturing his dynamic movements and the evolving spatial relationship between him and the background screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
