  "merged_caption": "This wide shot frames a large, dark taupe, six-sided die with black dots positioned in the center of the middle ground within a narrow, blue-walled room with a wooden floor. The room is lit by a soft, ambient light, creating a natural atmosphere. The camera begins by moving forward, pausing momentarily, and then smoothly panning to the right while tilting downward, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The die remains stationary for a few moments, showcasing its traditional cubic shape and distinct dot pattern. Suddenly, the die starts to break apart, with pieces flying off in various directions. The transformation completes as the die is reduced to several smaller cube shapes, scattered across the floor. These pieces retain the die's original color and dot pattern, revealing a wooden texture inside. The fragments come to rest in the middle ground, clustered in the center and extending toward the bottom right of the frame, with one piece landing closer in the foreground on the right. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the scene. The room's simple design and the die's transformation are the primary focus, maintaining a minimalist style with no additional furniture or decorations. Overlay elements include a white mouse cursor resembling a small hand at the center of the screen, which is not part of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera moving forward, pausing momentarily, and then smoothly panning to the right while tilting downward. The focus remains on a large die in the center of the room, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large, dark taupe, six-sided die with black dots, positioned closer to the back of the room and near the right wall on a wooden floor in a narrow, blue-walled room. The die is initially intact, showcasing its traditional cubic shape and distinct dot pattern. As the video progresses, the die breaks apart into several smaller cube shapes, scattered across the floor. These pieces retain the die's original color and dot pattern. The room's simple design and the die's transformation are the primary focus.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a large die placed in the corner of a blue-walled room with wooden flooring. The die remains stationary for a few moments. Suddenly, the die starts to break apart, with pieces flying off in various directions. The transformation completes as the die is reduced to several smaller cube shapes, spread across the floor.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a small, narrow indoor room with blue walls and a wooden floor. The room is lit by a soft, ambient light, creating a natural atmosphere. The central visual element is a large, white cube with black circular markings resembling a die, positioned on the floor. The cube appears solid and smooth. As the video progresses, the cube breaks apart into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces scattered across the floor, revealing a wooden texture inside. The scene maintains a minimalist style with no additional furniture or decorations. Overlay elements include a white mouse cursor resembling a small hand at the center of the screen, which is not part of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot frames a large die positioned in the center of the middle ground within a narrow room. The die then breaks apart, and its pieces scatter across the floor. The fragments come to rest in the middle ground, clustered in the center and extending toward the bottom right of the frame, with one piece landing closer in the foreground on the right. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
