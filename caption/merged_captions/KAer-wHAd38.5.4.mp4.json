  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins with a wide shot where a bridge guardrail is in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A muddy river is in the bottom right middle ground, next to green rice paddies that fill the center. In the background, green hills are visible across the center right and left of the frame, with a village on the left. The camera is positioned at eye level from the bridge, maintaining a deep focus, keeping the entire rural landscape sharp, from the bridge railing in the foreground to the hills in the background. The camera initially moves smoothly forward and to the left while simultaneously panning left, maintaining a wide shot. The bridge and its guardrails now frame the shot from the bottom left and right foreground to the center midground, with its paved road leading from the bottom center into the middle ground. At the end of the bridge, a red ceremonial gate is now the central element in the middle ground, with the rice paddies and hills now positioned in the background on the right. The perspective moves across the bridge, which has a gray metal guardrail, revealing a paved road leading toward a large, red welcome gate adorned with colorful flags at the far end. The view from the bridge overlooks a river, lush green rice paddies, and rolling, tree-covered hills under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The camera pans to reveal a small village with a decorative red welcome gate at its entrance. A metal utility pole stands in the green fields. The focus is on capturing the picturesque and serene atmosphere of the countryside, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the small community nestled within it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
