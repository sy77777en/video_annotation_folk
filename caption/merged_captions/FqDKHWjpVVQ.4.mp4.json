  "merged_caption": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with a dark vertical building in the left foreground partially obscuring the view. To the right, an enemy vehicle is slightly left of center in the middle ground, with trees and a damaged building in the background, also right of center. An \"ARMED\" objective marker is an overlay on the screen. The view then shifts, moving forward and left, to behind a mounted machine gun, which becomes the central foreground element. The first-person view, initially positioned beside a building, shows the soldier taking control of the mounted machine gun. The soldier pans slightly to the right and then to the left to target an enemy soldier approaching from his left side. The machine gun fires, and the enemy soldier falls to the ground. An enemy soldier enters from the right and runs left across the middle ground, center, in front of a low wall, with a building in the background, center, and vegetation in the background. The machine gun fires, and the enemy soldier falls in the middle ground, center, while on-screen text appears as an overlay in the bottom center. The camera maintains the character's eye-level perspective, using deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera motion is dynamic, panning left before zooming in to aim and shoot at an enemy, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle throughout most of the video, only shifting to a high angle when the enemy falls to the ground at the end. The action unfolds in an outdoor setting with scattered debris and vegetation, under an objective labeled \"ARMED.\" The setting features light-colored, simple concrete or stucco buildings, some appearing damaged, interspersed with lush green vegetation, including palm trees and bushes.",

    "Camera": "The video is a first-person shooter gameplay.

    "Subject": "A soldier, initially positioned behind a large, dark metallic building, moves forward into a war-torn, tropical environment. In the near distance, an enemy vehicle is visible amidst rubble and trees, with a damaged building further back. The soldier pans left before taking control of a mounted weapon, aims at an enemy combatant standing near a low wall, and fires. The enemy soldier is hit and falls to the ground, with on-screen text confirming the kill. The action unfolds in an outdoor setting with scattered debris and vegetation, under an objective labeled \"ARMED.\"",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, immerses the viewer in an outdoor, tropical environment during the daytime. The setting features light-colored, simple concrete or stucco buildings, some appearing damaged, interspersed with lush green vegetation, including palm trees and bushes. The ground consists of dirt, sand, and scattered rubble. In the background, a dark, metallic, and angular wrecked military vehicle is visible. The scene depicts movement as the viewpoint shifts, and includes the action of aiming and firing a weapon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
