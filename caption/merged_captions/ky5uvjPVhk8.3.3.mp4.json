  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene landscape in a Japanese garden during the late afternoon. Initially, the reflective body of water extends from the foreground to the middle ground, with large rocks partially submerged on the right. Lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and orange frame the pond on the left and right, while buildings rise in the background, adding an urban contrast. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a warm, golden light over the scene, enhancing the colors and creating a peaceful atmosphere. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It begins with a slight downward tilt, then pans right, and concludes with a smooth forward movement, maintaining minimal shaking throughout. As the camera pans to the right and moves forward, it smoothly transitions to highlight the natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere of the area. The camera then moves to reveal a stone pathway leading over a small bridge, positioned on the right, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The pathway is flanked by rocks and vibrant trees, with the garden extending into the background. The camera remains at a height that showcases the pathway and surrounding foliage, maintaining a focus on the garden's natural beauty. The water is calm, with a few large rocks partially submerged, adding texture to the scene. A stone pathway leads over a small stone bridge, inviting exploration of the garden's natural beauty. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the harmony between nature and urban elements rather than highlighting a specific object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
