  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot at eye level, looking straight ahead with deep focus, capturing a traditional Japanese street scene during daylight hours. Initially, two pedestrians in a yellow jacket and a dark jacket are in the middle ground, walking from the right towards the center on a cobblestone path. A cart with people is briefly visible in the background right, moving away from the camera. A small, arched stone bridge occupies the foreground center-left, with a traditional Japanese building in the middle ground to its left and behind it. A wooden sign is in the foreground left, and a stone pillar is in the foreground center, to the right of the bridge. The camera executes a very smooth pan to the left, revealing more of the street, including a wooden signpost and a small stone structure. As the camera pans further left, the initial two pedestrians continue moving leftward, but their position within the frame shifts to the right. The pan reveals more of the building complex, now in the center middle ground, featuring an entrance with a white banner, and a \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign to its left in the middle ground. A stone wall comes into view in the foreground, extending from the bottom left. By the end of the pan, this stone wall, topped by a wooden picket fence, stretches across the middle ground from left to right. Four new pedestrians are now visible in the middle ground, center-left, walking along the path beside this wall; two walk towards the camera and two walk away. Trees and bushes, some displaying autumn foliage, are present in the middle ground and background throughout the pan. The video concludes with a wider view of the street, showing more pedestrians and the surrounding environment.",

    "Camera": "Positioned at eye level and looking straight ahead, the camera maintains a wide shot and a level angle throughout the scene, using deep focus to ensure a large depth of field where most of the scene remains sharp. The camera executes a very smooth pan to the left, revealing more of the street scene and traditional buildings.",
    "Subject": "The video shows several pedestrians walking along a cobblestone path next to a paved road in what appears to be a Japanese town or village setting. Initially, two individuals in a yellow jacket and a dark jacket are walking towards the camera. On the far right side of the frame, a cart is being pulled by one person while two people ride in it, moving away from the camera. As the camera pans left, four individuals become visible in the middle-left of the frame; the two on the right are walking towards the camera, while the two on the left are walking away from it. Alongside the path are traditional Japanese-style buildings with tiled roofs and white walls, interspersed with various trees, including pines and some showing autumn colors. Stone elements like a small arched bridge, retaining walls, and inscribed pillars are visible. Various signs, including wooden informational boards, directional signs, and warning signs, are posted near the path and buildings. A low wooden fence runs along part of the stone wall.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a traditional Japanese street, featuring a stone bridge, traditional wooden buildings, and a horse-drawn carriage in the middle ground. Two people, one in a yellow jacket and the other in a dark jacket, walk along the sidewalk, passing by the stone bridge. The camera continues to pan left, revealing more of the street, including a wooden signpost and a small stone structure. As the camera pans further left, it shows a group of people walking in the opposite direction, some holding papers. The video concludes with a wider view of the street, showing more pedestrians and the surrounding environment.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a paved street in Japan during daylight hours. Adjacent to the street is a traditional Japanese building complex featuring white walls, dark wooden elements, and tiled roofs, fronted by a small, arched stone bridge over a rock-lined channel. A prominent white banner with black markings hangs near the entrance. The walkway is paved with stone slabs. Along the street, a low stone wall is topped by a simple wooden picket fence, behind which are green bushes and trees, some displaying autumn foliage. Various signs are visible, including wooden information boards with Japanese text, a circular red and white \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign, and an upright stone marker near the bridge. Pedestrians walk along the paved sidewalk beside the street. The camera pans to the left, causing the view to shift slightly and revealing more of the street and the people walking along the stone wall and fence.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a wide shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
