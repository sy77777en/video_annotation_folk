  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a young man with short, dark hair and a light complexion, appearing to be of East Asian descent, stands slightly right of center in the middle ground of a dimly lit basketball gymnasium, wearing a dark blue and white sleeveless jersey and holding a basketball. The camera captures this scene in slow motion from a smooth, hip-level position with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the player in sharp focus. A minor, smooth pan from right to left is present. To the far right, the back of another player wearing the number \"2\" is prominent in the foreground. In the background, a basketball hoop with a white backboard, red rim, and white net is positioned in the upper left corner, with a basketball arcing through the air to its left. Another player is on the floor in the bottom left middle ground. Other players in white jerseys, including one with the number \"13\", are visible in the right middle ground, in front and to the right of the main subject, while spectators occupy the shadowed, tiered seating in the background. The focused, artificial lighting creates a high-contrast look, highlighting the action on the court against the darker surroundings. The main subject dribbles the basketball from his left hand to his right hand, while another basketball player in the mid-ground is also dribbling. The scene captures the dynamic pre-game atmosphere, with several players in dark blue and white uniforms, along with some players wearing only white uniforms, occupying the court. The camera's smooth motion and shallow depth of field emphasize the player's focused movements amidst the bustling environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
