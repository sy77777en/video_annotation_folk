  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a pair of light-skinned hands holding a long, dark metal tool and a small, silver-colored, threaded screw occupies the center-right middle ground. The left hand carefully holds the tool, while the right hand adjusts the screw, pressing it against another small metal component attached to the main tool. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a slightly unsteady, static shot filmed at a level angle. An extremely shallow depth of field is used to keep the hands and the tool in sharp focus, rendering both the foreground and background indistinct. In the blurred background, the out-of-focus face of a person with light skin, dark hair, and dark eyes is positioned on the left side of the frame, showing a focused expression with a slight frown. The dimly lit indoor setting enhances the isolation of the precise action of the hands and the metallic components, with the background completely out of focus, showing only the blurred outline of the person's face. The subtly shaking close-up shot captures the dynamic motion as the person screws a bolt into the long, metal component, emphasizing the careful adjustment and pressing of the screw against the tool.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, static shot filmed at a level angle. An extremely shallow depth of field is used to focus on the hands working on a small metal object in the midground, while the person's face behind them is heavily blurred.",
    "Subject": "In a close-up view, a person's light-skinned hands carefully hold a long, dark metal tool. The hands are adjusting a small, silver-colored, threaded screw. The screw is being pressed against another small metal component attached to the main tool. In the blurred background, the out-of-focus face of a person with light skin, dark hair, and dark eyes can be seen.",
    "Motion": "In a subtly shaking close-up shot, a person is screwing a bolt into a long, metal component. His left hand carefully holds a long, dark metal tool, while his right hand adjusts a small, silver-colored, threaded screw.

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a close-up shot focuses on a pair of hands holding a long, dark metal tool. One hand presses a small, silver-colored metal piece with a threaded screw against the tool. The background is completely out of focus, showing only the blurred outline of a person's face. The shallow depth of field isolates the precise action of the hands and the metallic components.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
