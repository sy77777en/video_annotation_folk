  "merged_caption": "The video captures an extreme wide shot of a serene landscape dominated by a vast body of water, maintaining a consistent aerial perspective throughout, positioned high above the scene. The water occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. On the left side, dense greenery and forested areas are visible in the middle ground, while similar vegetation appears on the right side. In the background, rolling hills and distant mountains form a continuous horizon line across the top of the frame. Small islands with clusters of trees are situated near the center of the water, slightly towards the middle ground. The video begins with a wide view of the lake under a clear blue sky. As the camera moves smoothly forward while panning right and trucking left, multiple boats appear on the lake, creating ripples as they move across the water. One boat on the left side of the lake starts moving towards the right, leaving a trail in the water. The camera continues to advance, capturing the boats as they progress further across the lake. The boats become smaller in the distance as the camera keeps moving forward and to the left, revealing more of the lake and the surrounding landscape. The video ends with the boats almost out of sight, and the camera still moving forward, providing a broader view of the lake and the scenic surroundings. The sky, dotted with scattered clouds, forms the upper part of the frame, completing the expansive composition. The deep blue water contrasts with the vibrant green of the trees, and the distant mountains provide a majestic backdrop, enhancing the sense of tranquility and vastness in the scene.",

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a serene outdoor setting featuring a large, calm body of water surrounded by lush greenery. The scene is set during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The expansive lake is bordered by dense forests and rolling hills, creating a picturesque landscape. The water is a deep blue, contrasting with the vibrant green of the trees. Small islands with clusters of trees are visible within the lake, adding to the natural beauty. Boats occasionally traverse the water's surface, leaving trails behind them, which adds a dynamic element to the tranquil scene. The distant mountains provide a majestic backdrop, enhancing the sense of tranquility and vastness in the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
