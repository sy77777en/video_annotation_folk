  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a group of people, mostly men in casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans, is framed from behind, occupying the foreground and middle ground as they walk away from the camera down the center of a dimly lit tunnel. The tunnel's metallic walls and ribbed ceiling frame the shot on the left, right, and top, creating a path that recedes into the background. Initially, a red light source from behind the camera illuminates the subjects, casting a red hue that highlights their silhouettes. The camera, positioned at eye level with deep focus and minimal shaking, smoothly moves forward, following the group at a steady pace. As they continue walking, the light at the end of the tunnel gradually becomes brighter because the tunnel door is slowly opening, allowing more light from outside to illuminate the space. The bright white light source at the tunnel's exit in the center background expands and intensifies, progressively backlighting the figures and turning them into silhouettes. The lighting shifts dramatically, creating a stark contrast with the initial darkness and emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective. The overall ambiance is industrial, with a focus on the interplay between light and shadow. The camera maintains a level angle throughout the shot, capturing the group's movement and transition as they progress forward toward the bright light, which becomes more pronounced as the exit opens further. The tunnel's structure remains consistent, with metal walls and a ribbed ceiling, while the group moves closer to the bright light, emphasizing their movement and transition as the group progresses forward.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and maintaining a level angle. It uses deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward, following the group of people walking through the tunnel, with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of people walking through a tunnel. The individuals are mostly men, wearing casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. The lighting in the tunnel shifts from a dim red to a bright white, creating a dramatic contrast. The camera angle shows their backs as they walk towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, emphasizing their movement and transition as the group progresses forward.",
    "Motion": "A group of people, including men and women, are walking through a dimly lit tunnel with red lighting. As they continue walking, the light at the end of the tunnel gradually becomes brighter because the tunnel door is slowly opening, allowing more light from outside to illuminate the space. The group maintains a steady pace, and the increasing brightness of the light ahead becomes more pronounced. The tunnel's structure remains consistent, with metal walls and a ribbed ceiling, while the group moves closer to the bright light.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit tunnel, characterized by its metallic walls and ceiling. The environment transitions from a dark, red-tinged atmosphere, with the red light originating from within the tunnel, to a bright, white light coming from outside as the exit gradually opens. The tunnel's structure is cylindrical, with ribbed metal surfaces that create a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting shifts dramatically, initially casting a red hue that highlights the silhouettes of several figures walking towards the exit. As the scene progresses and the exit opens further, the intensity of the bright white light increases, enveloping the figures and creating a stark contrast with the initial darkness. The overall ambiance is industrial, with a focus on the interplay between light and shadow, emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a group of people is framed from behind, occupying the foreground and middle ground as they walk away from the camera down the center of a tunnel. The tunnel walls frame the shot on the left, right, and top, creating a path that recedes into the background. Initially, a red light source from behind the camera illuminates the subjects. As the group moves forward toward the background, a bright white light source at the tunnel's exit in the center background expands and intensifies, progressively backlighting the figures and turning them into silhouettes.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
