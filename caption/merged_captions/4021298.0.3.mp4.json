  "merged_caption": "In an initial full shot filmed at the subjects' level, a standing white camel occupies the left foreground, positioned in front of a stone wall that stretches from the foreground to the middle ground. This camel is outfitted with a decorative, striped saddle adorned with colorful tassels and a blue halter. Behind it to the right, a dark brown camel stands in the middle ground, with a large, craggy rock formation in the background. The camera then pans slowly to the right while tilting downward, transitioning to a high-angle perspective that reveals several other camels resting in a sunny, outdoor setting. During this motion, the camera also moves back slightly, causing the standing white camel to move out of the left side of the frame. This movement reveals a sitting white camel in the left foreground, which has a black, spiky decoration on its forehead and is equipped with a saddle partially covered by a red blanket. Another sitting light brown camel is visible in the right foreground, and behind this camel, the rear of another camel is visible in the right middle ground. The camels remain mostly stationary throughout the shot, with only slight, subtle movements, such as chewing actions and leg movements. In the final composition, the dark brown camel almost disappears from the frame, with only its legs partially visible in the top left corner. The camera consistently maintains an eye-level perspective throughout the shot, keeping the entire scene in sharp focus with a large depth of field. The movement is slightly unsteady and concludes with a noticeable shake, as the bright sunlight casts strong shadows across the scene, highlighting the sandy and uneven ground near the rough stone wall.",

    "Subject": "A group of saddled dromedary camels are gathered in a sandy area next to a stone wall. On the left, a white camel stands, wearing a bridle and a colorful saddle adorned with a red, white, and orange striped blanket and multicolored tassels. In the center, another white camel is sitting on the ground. It has a black, spiky decoration on its forehead and is also equipped with a saddle, which is partially covered by a red blanket. Behind the standing white camel, a dark brown camel is standing. To the right of the sitting camel, another sitting light brown camel is visible, and behind this camel, the rear of another camel is visible. The camera gradually pans from left to right, causing the camels to move in and out of the frame, although their relative positions to each other remain unchanged, and they are mostly stationary.",
    "Motion": "The camera pans slowly from left to right, revealing a group of saddled camels resting in a sandy area next to a stone wall. A white camel stands on the left, while several other camels are sitting or standing nearby. The camels remain mostly stationary throughout the shot, with only slight, subtle movements, such as chewing actions and leg movements.",
    "Scene": "In a sunny, outdoor setting at the base of a large, craggy rock formation, several camels are gathered near a rough stone wall. The ground is sandy and uneven. A white camel stands in the left foreground, outfitted with a decorative, striped saddle adorned with colorful tassels and a blue halter, but goes out of frame later as the camera moves. Nearby, other camels are sitting or standing, including another white one that is lying on the ground, all equipped with saddles and harnesses. The bright sunlight casts strong shadows across the scene as the view pans to show the group of animals.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
