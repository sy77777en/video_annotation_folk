  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot capturing two women on a spiral staircase within a spacious indoor setting. The woman at the top of the staircase, with light skin, wearing a white shirt, checkered vest, and black skirt, is positioned slightly to the left in the upper part of the frame, leaning over the railing. She is in the middle ground, elevated above the other woman. The second woman, with dark skin and curly hair, dressed in a white blouse, dark pants, and black shoes, is seated on the stairs, located in the lower middle part of the frame, also in the middle ground, reading a book. The spiral staircase itself, made of polished wood with smooth curves and vertical slats, occupies the central area of the frame, serving as the focal point. Large windows with white frames are situated in the background, allowing natural light to enter the room, creating a bright and airy atmosphere. The muted green walls and wooden furniture, including simple tables and chairs, are distributed around the room, enhancing the sense of depth and contributing to a cozy and inviting environment. The camera is positioned at eye level and a level angle, employing deep focus to maintain clarity throughout the scene. It exhibits minor, slightly unsteady movement without clear intentional direction, capturing the scene with the focus remaining on the two women and the staircase. The room is well-lit, suggesting daytime, and the arrangement of furniture and architectural features provides a harmonious and balanced composition. The camera remains at a fixed height, capturing the scene from a level angle, providing a clear view of both the women and the surrounding environment. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements throughout the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
