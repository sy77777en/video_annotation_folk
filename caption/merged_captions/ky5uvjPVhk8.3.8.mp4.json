  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing two people on a path in a Japanese garden during autumn. The man, wearing a white jacket, dark pants, and black shoes, holds a phone and faces the woman, who is in a white shirt with a brown plaid pattern, a long yellow vest, black shorts, and black knee-high boots. She stands slightly further down the path, smiling and moving her body as if performing a simple dance. Both are positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The path, bordered by lush greenery and vibrant foliage, curves gently, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene. The camera, positioned at eye level, maintains a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field, moving forward along the curved trail and panning slightly to the right. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, as it approaches the two people. The man transitions from kneeling to standing, frequently adjusting the height of the phone to change the shooting angle, while the woman remains in the middle ground. The camera gradually brings them to the center of the frame and then slightly to the left, maintaining a consistent height at the subjects' level. The serene garden setting is enhanced by the colorful leaves and well-maintained landscape, with small shrubs with pink flowers lining the path on the left and a stone wall on the right. Signs with Japanese characters contribute to the cultural ambiance. The surrounding greenery and stone elements are present in the foreground, middle ground, and background, enhancing the spatial depth of the scene. The interaction suggests a photo or video session, with the natural beauty of the garden providing a vibrant backdrop.",

She has long brown hair and is positioned slightly further down the path. The interaction suggests a photo or video session.",
    "Motion": "The man stands on the path, holding a phone and facing the woman, who is positioned slightly further down the path. He appears to be taking photos or recording a video of her. The man initially crouches before standing up, frequently adjusting the height of the phone with his hands to change the shooting angle. The woman moves her body with a smile, as if performing a simple dance for the camera, while the vibrant foliage provides a colorful backdrop to their photo or video session.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing a serene outdoor setting in a Japanese garden during autumn. The path is paved and gently curves through the scene, bordered by lush greenery and vibrant foliage. The trees display a mix of green, orange, and red leaves, indicating the seasonal transition. On the left, small shrubs with pink flowers line the path, while on the right, a stone wall slightly lower than a person adds texture and depth. Signs with Japanese characters are placed along the path, contributing to the cultural ambiance. Two individuals are present, one in a white jacket and another in a yellow long vest, taking photos or videos along the path. The atmosphere is calm, with the natural beauty of the garden highlighted by the colorful leaves and well-maintained landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing two people on a path in a Japanese garden. Both the man in the white jacket and the woman in the yellow vest are positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the man transitions from kneeling to standing, but their positions remain unchanged. Instead, the camera moves closer to them, gradually bringing them to the center of the frame and then slightly to the left, while they consistently remain in the middle ground. The path curves gently, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene, with vibrant foliage in the background. The camera maintains a consistent height at the subjects' level, emphasizing their interaction within the serene garden setting. The surrounding greenery and stone elements are present in the foreground, middle ground, and background, enhancing the spatial depth of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
