  "merged_caption": "This scenery video is captured in an extreme wide, fixed but slightly shaking shot, showcasing a time-lapse of a storm system over a flat, arid landscape. A dark, empty field occupies the foreground across the bottom fifth of the frame, while the middle ground consists of a flat plain stretching to a distant horizon line. The background is dominated by a vast sky filled with immense, turbulent storm clouds tinged with shades of orange, yellow, and dark brown, likely due to a sunset or dust in the air. A prominent, lower-hanging shelf cloud extends horizontally across the middle of the sky, with formations resembling heavy precipitation or dust falling beneath it, primarily on the left and in the center. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking across the landscape as the cloud formations slowly shift across the scene. The time-lapse captures the rapid movement of the storm system, with the dramatic, wide-angle view emphasizing the sheer scale of the atmospheric display. Although rain is not visibly falling, the turbulent sky and distant silhouette of mountains create a striking, stormy atmosphere. In the far background on the right, a mountain range is visible on the horizon, adding depth to the scene. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with a low-angle position that is somewhat ambiguous, appearing to be between eye-level and overhead. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire landscape from the foreground fields to the distant mountains sharp. The composition's intent is to immerse the viewer in the powerful and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the natural environment, capturing the dynamic and dramatic unfolding of the weather event over the vast, open plain.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a storm, captured from a fixed but slightly unsteady, low-angle position. The camera height is somewhat ambiguous, appearing to be between eye-level and overhead. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire landscape from the foreground fields to the distant mountains sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a dramatic landscape scene, capturing a powerful weather event unfolding over a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by immense, churning clouds tinted in ominous shades of orange, brown, and muted yellow, with a prominent, lower shelf cloud suggesting the leading edge of a severe storm. At the bottom of the video lies an open field, with the horizon marked by the silhouette of a road and scattered utility poles, where a few vehicles pass by. Distant mountains are visible on the right side, adding depth to the scene. The composition's intent is to immerse the viewer in the powerful and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the sheer scale of the atmospheric display.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video capturing the rapid movement of a storm system over a flat, arid landscape. The dramatic, wide-angle view showcases massive storm clouds glowing in shades of orange and brown, likely due to a sunset or dust in the air. A prominent shelf cloud stretches across the scene, with formations resembling heavy precipitation or dust falling beneath it. Although rain is not visibly falling, the turbulent sky and distant silhouette of mountains create a striking, stormy atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A wide, fixed but slightly shaking shot captures a dramatic storm system at sunset over a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with immense, turbulent clouds tinged with shades of orange, yellow, and dark brown. A distinct, lower-hanging shelf cloud stretches horizontally across the landscape, with a curtain of rain or dust falling beneath it in the distance. The foreground consists of a dark, empty field, while the silhouette of a distant mountain range is visible on the right horizon.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery video is captured in an extreme wide, fixed but slightly shaking shot. A dark, empty field occupies the foreground across the bottom fifth of the frame. The middle ground consists of a flat plain stretching to a distant horizon line. The background is dominated by a vast sky filled with storm clouds, which take up most of the frame. A prominent, lower-hanging shelf cloud extends horizontally across the middle of the sky, with a curtain of precipitation or possibly a dust storm falling beneath it, primarily on the left and in the center. In the far background on the right, a mountain range is visible on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking across the landscape as the cloud formations slowly shift across the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
