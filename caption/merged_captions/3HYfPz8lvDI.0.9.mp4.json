  "merged_caption": "In a wide, level-angle shot, a light-skinned man with short, dark hair is sunbathing on a wooden lounge chair with a white cushion, positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. He is wearing red swim trunks, sunglasses, and brown sandals, with his arms resting at his sides and his head propped up slightly as he faces upward. Rows of empty lounge chairs extend from the bottom-left foreground into the middle ground around him. In the background, a modern building with large glass windows occupies the upper middle and right midground of the frame, while a similar building is visible in the upper left corner. To the left of the man, in the middle ground, stands a brown umbrella. The entire scene is peaceful, with the camera moving forward in a very smooth, subtle motion, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The man lying on the lounge chair moves his head and feet slightly, suggesting he is experiencing a sense of pleasure. The patio is adjacent to a modern building featuring large glass windows and doors, with a stone-textured facade.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
