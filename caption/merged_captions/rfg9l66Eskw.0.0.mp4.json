  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a grassy field, wearing a light-colored bucket hat, a long-sleeved shirt with a black-and-white camouflage pattern, and black pants. Initially bent over while holding a large, black camera with a long telephoto lens, she transitions into a low crouching position, shifting to the center-right of the frame. As she lowers her body, she raises the camera to her eye, aiming it toward the left side of the scene. The foreground and middle ground are filled with green and yellow blades of grass, while the background is softly blurred, revealing a line of green trees and taller, slender trees under an overcast sky. The camera is positioned at a fixed, slightly unsteady hip-level position, maintaining a level angle with a shallow depth of field, keeping the photographer in the midground in focus.",

    "Scene": "In a grassy field with green and yellow blades of grass, a woman wearing a light-colored hat, a black-and-white patterned shirt, and black pants moves from a bent-over stance to a kneeling position. She holds a large, black telephoto camera lens, directing it towards the left side of the scene. The background is softly blurred, revealing a line of green trees and taller, slender trees under an overcast sky.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a grassy field. Initially bent over while holding a large camera, she transitions into a low crouching position, shifting to the center-right of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
