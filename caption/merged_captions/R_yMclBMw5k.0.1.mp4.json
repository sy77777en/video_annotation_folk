  "merged_caption": "A stream of shimmering golden particles flows in a gentle arc from the upper left of the frame toward the lower right against a solid black background. The main body of the stream occupies the middle ground, creating a dense, luminous trail composed of shades of yellow, gold, and amber, which sparkles as the particles drift and shimmer within the current. Individual particles are scattered throughout the scene, with many appearing blurred and relatively scattered in the foreground, particularly in the lower right corner. Some blurred particles are also visible in the upper left corner of the background, establishing a sense of depth. The densest part of the stream glows with a warm, yellow light, gradually fading into the darkness at its edges. In the upper right background, faint beams of light are cast onto the particle flow, adding an extra layer of dynamism. The entire formation moves slowly and continuously from left to right along its curved trajectory. The particles, which resemble fine glitter or dust, vary in size and brightness, with some appearing as sharp, luminous specks and others as larger, geometric spheres or polyhedrons, adding a distinct dimension to the visual composition. This is a static shot with a stationary camera, featuring particles distributed across the foreground, middle ground, and background. The shallow depth of field brings the middle ground particles into focus, creating a sense of dimension by blurring elements that are closer to or further from the focal plane. A faint, warm light source is suggested in the upper right, casting a subtle glow on the composition.",

    "Scene": "A stream of shimmering golden particles flows in a gentle arc from the upper left to the lower right against a solid black background. The particles, varying in size and brightness, create a sense of depth, with some appearing sharp and in focus while others are soft and blurred. In the upper right corner, small, constantly changing yellow beams are projected onto the particle flow, adding an extra layer of dynamism. The densest part of the stream glows with a warm, yellow light, gradually fading into the darkness at its edges. The movement is slow and continuous, creating an abstract and dynamic visual.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
