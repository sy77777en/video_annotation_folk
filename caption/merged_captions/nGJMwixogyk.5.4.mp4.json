  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene street scene in a traditional Japanese neighborhood. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective. In the initial frame, the street runs diagonally from the bottom left to the bottom right, with traditional wooden buildings lining the middle ground. These buildings have their facades and balconies clearly visible, featuring a mix of dark wood and light-colored facades, with some structures showcasing intricate balconies and sliding doors. Lush greenery is primarily in the foreground, directly in front of the camera, with additional greenery visible in the middle ground, situated just in front of the traditional buildings. The clear blue sky is visible, and power lines stand in the middle ground, just in front of the buildings. As the video progresses, the camera trucks right to view the street, then midway adds a pan right to face the front-right, maintaining the wide shot while revealing more of the street and additional buildings. The power lines are revealed to extend towards the background. A person on an electric scooter, delivering food, enters the frame, adding a touch of modern urban life to the peaceful and picturesque setting. Another individual walks nearby, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, enhancing the first-person POV experience. The overall setting is calm and picturesque, with a harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements, creating a peaceful and inviting urban landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
