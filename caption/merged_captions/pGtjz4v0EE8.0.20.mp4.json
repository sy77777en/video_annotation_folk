  "merged_caption": "This video captures the ornate facade of a Gothic cathedral with dynamic camera movement. The camera tilts upward and pans to the right, revealing rows of white statues set within individual, pointed-arch niches in the upper half of the frame. A large triangular pediment filled with detailed relief sculptures is positioned in the lower-center and left, while a large, circular rose window with elaborate tracery occupies the bottom right. The entire scene is illuminated by golden sunlight, casting long, sharp shadows that slowly creep across the detailed stonework in a time-lapse effect, highlighting the craftsmanship and design. The play of light and shadow throws the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, into high relief. The composition highlights the grandeur of the structure, showcasing the deep, slowly shifting shadows that indicate a time-lapse of the sun's movement. The shot is captured from a level angle and maintains a deep focus, keeping the intricate architectural details sharp throughout the frame. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the magnificent Gothic Revival architecture of the Florence Cathedral rather than a specific subject.",

    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a static, detailed view of a magnificent Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the grandeur of the structure rather than a specific subject. Bathed in the golden light of the sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is thrown into high relief by deep, slowly shifting shadows. The composition highlights rows of sculpted figures standing in ornate, pointed-arch niches, the detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a detailed view of an ornate building facade, showcasing intricate sculptures and architectural elements. The play of light and shadow highlights the craftsmanship and design.",
    "Scene": "A detailed view captures the ornate, polychrome marble facade of the Florence Cathedral. The Gothic Revival architecture features intricate patterns of white and dark green marble. Rows of white statues stand within individual, pointed-arch niches along the upper portion of the building. Below, a large triangular pediment above an entrance is filled with detailed relief sculptures. To the right, a large, circular rose window with elaborate tracery is visible. The entire scene is illuminated by golden sunlight, which casts long, sharp shadows that slowly creep across the detailed stonework in a time-lapse effect.",
    "Spatial": "This video captures the ornate facade of a cathedral with dynamic camera movement. The camera tilts upward and pans to the right, revealing rows of statues set within niches in the upper half of the frame. A large triangular pediment is positioned in the lower-center and left, while a large rose window occupies the bottom right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
