  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a single, translucent jellyfish in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground against a dark, indistinct background. The jellyfish, with a flattened, bell-shaped body and a delicate, thin rim, pulses and drifts, its body exhibiting gentle, flowing movements as it subtly undulates and changes shape. The creature glows with a turquoise hue, and visible within its center are more complex, folded structures that share the same color. As the jellyfish rhythmically pulsates its bell-shaped body, its short tentacles at the edges and an intricate ribbon-like structure in the center transform in shape, contracting and expanding to propel itself slowly through the dark water. The translucent bell changes shape with each gentle pulse, creating a slow, drifting motion. Throughout the video, it remains consistently in the center of the frame. This underwater shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the jellyfish in the foreground. The camera is slightly unsteady with some shaking, but any specific movement is unclear due to the lack of background cues. The dark aquatic environment features faint, overlapping small ripples that add depth and texture to the scene, enhancing the visual experience.",

    "Subject": "A single, translucent jellyfish with a turquoise glow is depicted against a dark background. The creature has a flattened, bell-shaped body with a delicate, thin rim. Visible within its center are more complex, folded structures that are also translucent and share the same turquoise hue.",
    "Motion": "A single jellyfish rhythmically pulsates its bell-shaped body, with its short tentacles at the edges and an intricate ribbon-like structure in the center, all transforming in shape as it contracts and expands to propel itself slowly through the dark water. The translucent bell changes shape with each gentle pulse, creating a slow, drifting motion.",
    "Scene": "A single, translucent jellyfish floats in a dark aquatic environment, where faint, overlapping small ripples add depth and texture to the scene. The creature glows with a cyan light and has a thin, bell-shaped body containing intricate, folded structures within. It drifts and pulses gently, its gelatinous form subtly changing shape as it moves through the water.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot frames a single, translucent jellyfish in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground against a dark, indistinct background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
