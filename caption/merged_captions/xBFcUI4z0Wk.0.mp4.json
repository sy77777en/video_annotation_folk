  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, two damaged race cars are initially positioned in the middle ground. A white #98 car, featuring a blue \"Ford\" logo and black designs on its rear, is on the grass to the right of the frame's center, while a black and yellow #2 car, with 'Gimme Country' branding, is slightly behind it and to its left, also on the grass. The video captures a dramatic collision between these two race cars on a track, both sustaining visible damage. The white car has a damaged front bumper, and the black and yellow car trails smoke. As the camera smoothly zooms in and pans left, both cars slide diagonally from the middle ground toward the bottom-left foreground, skidding and spinning across the grassy area next to the track before eventually coming to a stop. The white car comes to rest on the border between the grass and the track in the bottom-center of the frame, while the #2 car stops on the track behind the white car, positioned further into the middle ground. The track itself curves from the bottom left up towards the top right, with a grassy infield occupying the center and right side of the scene. The overhead camera, looking down from about second-floor height, employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The movement is steady with minimal shaking, maintaining a clear view of the action. The scene captures an outdoor setting on a racetrack during an event, with lighting illuminating the area, conveying a sense of dynamic motion and intensity, with tire marks visible on the track, adding to the sense of recent high-speed activity.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead camera at a high angle, looking down from about second-floor height. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera smoothly zooms in and pans left to track the racing cars, which become larger in the frame as they move. The movement is steady with minimal shaking, maintaining a clear view of the action.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases two main race cars on a track, both involved in a collision. The primary focus is on a white race car with a red number 98 prominently displayed on its side, featuring black designs on its rear and a blue \"Ford\" logo. This car has visible damage to its front bumper and is positioned adjacent to the track on the grass. The secondary subject is a black and yellow race car with the number 2, which is also damaged and trailing smoke, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the first car. Both cars are next to the track, indicating a recent impact, and their proximity highlights the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a dramatic collision between two race cars on a track.

After the impact, the cars skid and spin across the grassy area next to the track before eventually coming to a stop. The white car ends up on the grass with a damaged front bumper, while the black and yellow car trails smoke and is positioned slightly behind and to the left of the white car, illustrating the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during an event, with lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide, paved track wrapping around a grassy area, bordered by a concrete wall, suggesting a professional racing environment. Two cars are prominently visible, both with noticeable damage, skidding across the grass and track. The cars display vibrant colors and sponsor logos, with smoke trailing from their movements, indicating recent collisions. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic motion and intensity, with tire marks visible on the track, adding to the sense of recent high-speed activity.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
