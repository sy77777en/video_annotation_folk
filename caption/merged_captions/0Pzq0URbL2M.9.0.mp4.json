  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, focusing on the left middle ground where a cylindrical container, partially displaying its biohazard symbol, is located. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on Anthrax bottles in the midground. The camera then trucks left while panning right and simultaneously moving backward, transitioning the view to a full shot that reveals three stationary, light-colored cylindrical containers, each marked with a biohazard symbol and text. As the camera repositions, the first container, labeled \"Cholera - コレラ,\" moves from the left middle ground to the left foreground. The second container, labeled \"Anthrax - 炭疽,\" shifts from the left middle ground to the center foreground. Meanwhile, the third container, labeled \"Typhoid - チフス,\" remains in the right foreground. In the final full shot, these three labeled containers are aligned side-by-side in the foreground—\"Cholera\" to the left, \"Anthrax\" in the center, and \"Typhoid\" to the right—with an out-of-focus background suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or storage setting. The containers have a slightly worn and rusted appearance, with visible metallic bands at the top and bottom, and a small, circular metallic fitting near the bottom. The camera starts close to an Anthrax bottle, continuously trucking left and panning right to adjust its orientation until facing the bottles, while simultaneously moving backward to create distance. The movement is very smooth. A white overlay user interface displaying the numbers [8, 10, 22, 23] is visible in the lower-left corner of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",

    "Subject": "The video displays three cylindrical, light-colored containers, likely off-white or light gray, arranged side-by-side. Each container features a metallic band encircling both the base and the top, along with a small, circular metallic fitting near the bottom. The surfaces of the containers appear worn, with smudges and possible rust spots. A black biohazard symbol is prominently printed on the side of each cylinder. Above this symbol, black text identifies the contents. The central container is labeled \"Anthrax - 炭疽\". To its left, another container is labeled \"Cholera - コレラ\". The container on the right is labeled \"Typhoid - チフス\".",
    "Motion": "The camera trucks left and pans right to reorient itself toward the containers, while also moving backward, revealing three stationary, light-colored cylindrical containers, each marked with a biohazard symbol and text.",
    "Scene": "The video features a close-up, panning, and tracking shot of three cylindrical, off-white containers. Each container prominently displays a black biohazard symbol on its side. Above the biohazard symbol, text overlays in English and Japanese label the contents as \"Anthrax - 炭疽,\" \"Cholera - コレラ,\" and \"Typhoid - チフス.\" The containers have a slightly worn and rusted appearance, with visible metallic bands at the top and bottom. The background is dimly lit and out of focus, suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or storage setting. The camera trucks left and pans right to adjust its orientation toward the containers while simultaneously moving backward. A white overlay user interface displaying the numbers [8, 10, 22, 23] is visible in the lower-left corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
