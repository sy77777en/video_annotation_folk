  "merged_caption": "This medium shot follows a woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a dusty pink tank top, dark shorts, and a light-colored baseball cap facing forward, as she walks through a large outdoor flower farm. She is shown from behind, centered in the frame, carrying a large black cylindrical bucket filled with a bouquet of long-stemmed, light-colored flowers and green foliage in her left arm. The path she walks on is flanked by rows of green plants and flowers on the left and right, which extend from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a line of evergreen trees stands before a distant mountain range under an overcast sky. The camera captures this scene in slow motion from a shaky, eye-level perspective, moving forward slowly and tracking the woman as she walks straight through the flower field, gradually becoming smaller in the frame. A deep focus is used, keeping both the woman and the surrounding flower field sharp. As she moves away from the camera, the path winds through a blend of green foliage and flower beds, with tall plants and pale flowers interspersed throughout the scene. In the distance, beyond more rows of yellow and red flowers, the line of trees and the hazy mountain range complete the serene landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
