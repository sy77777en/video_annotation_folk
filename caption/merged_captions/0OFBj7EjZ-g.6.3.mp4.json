  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot focuses on a cylindrical container positioned in the foreground, occupying the top center and right of the frame. The base of the container is located in the right and center of the frame, with a leak visible on its upper edge. Below the base, support structures extend toward the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground of the lower right corner, another semi-translucent, white-pink cylindrical structure is visible. In the background, a dark, gridded floor is visible on the left and bottom, establishing the scene's depth. The camera performs a slight downward movement and tilts upward, transitioning to a level-angle view of a leaking gasket at the base of an object. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The only movement is the downward fall of liquid droplets from the leak in the center of the frame. Two droplets of liquid fall almost simultaneously from a pool leaking at the base of a cylindrical container. The droplets detach and fall straight down, with new droplets forming in their place, but without a steady rhythm or prominent elongation process. A close-up view shows a cylindrical container with a translucent, teal-colored upper section and a light gray, opaque base. A clear liquid is leaking from the seam where the two sections meet. The liquid pools on the curved rim of the base, and multiple droplets are depicted falling from the pool. A structure with a texture similar to the base and another cylindrical structure with a translucent, white texture are visible below the base. In a simulated environment with a dark, gridded floor marked by white and pink lines, a close-up shot focuses on the base of a cylindrical object. The object consists of a glossy, teal-colored upper section and a matte, light-grey lower section.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
