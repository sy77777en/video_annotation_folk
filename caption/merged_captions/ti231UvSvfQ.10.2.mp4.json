  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young, light-skinned man with short, neat brown hair and a clean-shaven face is initially positioned in the right middle ground of the frame. He is wearing a dark, scoop-neck t-shirt and maintains a startled expression, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. The dimly lit room features dark, plain walls and a similarly dark corner, with a cool, directional light source casting deep shadows. To his right, a grey wall with two small metallic plates occupies the left background, while a door with a rectangular air vent is initially visible to the left of the center. As the man navigates through the dimly lit area, the camera, at eye-level, follows his movement from the front, moving backward while panning left. The camera keeps him framed in the left part of the shot, maintaining a shallow depth of field to focus on him in the midground. As he turns a corner, the camera comes to a stop, remaining static but with noticeable shaking, capturing his intense gaze directed at something beyond the frame. The environment has a cool-toned color scheme, and as the man moves from the right toward the left side of the frame, the wall with the air vent disappears to the right side. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip, ensuring that the startled expression and the dimly lit setting with one side of his face illuminated and the other in shadow are clearly visible.",

    "Camera": "At an eye-level, a slightly unsteady handheld camera leads a man from the front, moving backward while panning left. The camera then comes to a stop, remaining static but with noticeable shaking. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the man in the midground.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, neat brown hair and a clean-shaven face is shown from the chest up. He is wearing a dark, scoop-neck t-shirt. In the dimly lit setting, with one side of his face illuminated and the other in shadow, he looks directly forward with a startled expression, his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open.",
    "Motion": "A man navigates through a dimly lit area, maintaining a startled expression. As he turns a corner, the camera follows his movement, capturing his intense gaze directed at something beyond the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a similarly dark corner. A cool, directional light source casts deep shadows throughout the space. On the left, a large, white cabinet features two small, rectangular metallic plates. A rectangular air vent with horizontal slats is set into the wall in the background. The environment has a cool-toned color scheme. A person is present in the room, and after they pass the corner, the wall with the air vent goes out of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is initially positioned in the right middle ground of the frame. To his right, a grey wall with two small metallic plates occupies the left background. A door with a rectangular air vent is initially visible to the left of the center and then disappears to the right side as the man moves. The camera pans left as the man moves from the right toward the left side of the frame, keeping him framed in the left part of the shot. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
