  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, an animated young boy with brown hair, wearing a light green t-shirt and grey socks, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on the light-colored tiled floor of a brightly lit bathroom. He has a distressed facial expression as a thick, vibrant green, slimy substance comes out of his nostrils. The floor around him is scattered with bright green, vine-like objects; one is coiled like a spring on the bottom right, and another looks like a splattered leaf on the bottom left, appearing to be made of the same substance. In the background, a white bathtub and shower curtain are visible on the left, while a simple shelving unit and a white toilet stand on the right. The overall lighting is soft and diffuse, illuminating the clean, modern space. The animated boy sits on the tiled floor, lifting and lowering his head with his cheeks puffed out, while the green substance coming from his nose is moving, and the substance on the floor around him remains stationary. The camera, positioned at the subject's level with a slight Dutch angle, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground. The shot is initially static, but towards the end of the video, there is a quick, smooth zoom-in on the boy's face, adding dynamic movement to the composition. The boy remains in the same position throughout the scene, enhancing the focus on his expression and the unusual green substance.",

    "Camera": "From a ground-level perspective with a slight Dutch angle, the camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground. The shot is initially static before executing a quick, smooth zoom-in on the boy's face near the end.",
    "Subject": "An animated young boy with brown hair, wearing a light green t-shirt and grey socks, has a distressed facial expression. A thick, vibrant green, slimy substance is coming out of his nostrils. On the floor around him are several similarly colored green objects; one is coiled like a spring, and another looks like a splattered leaf, appearing to be made of the same substance.",
    "Motion": "An animated boy sits on a tiled floor, lifting and lowering his head with his cheeks puffed out. The green substance coming from his nose is moving, while the substance on the floor around him remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a brightly lit bathroom with light-colored tiled flooring. In the background, a white bathtub and shower curtain are visible on the left, while a simple shelving unit and a white toilet stand on the right. The floor is scattered with bright green, vine-like objects, one of which is curled into a spiral. A young boy in a light green shirt and gray socks is sitting on the floor in the center of the room. The overall lighting is soft and diffuse, illuminating the clean, modern space.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, an animated boy is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on the floor. In the foreground, a coiled green object rests on the bottom right, while another green object is on the bottom left. The background contains a bathtub and shower curtain on the left, and a shelving unit and toilet on the right. The boy remains in the same position throughout the scene. Towards the end of the video, there is a quick zoom-in, adding dynamic movement to the composition. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
