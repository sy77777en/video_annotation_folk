  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a large cargo plane inside a hangar, capturing most of its body and surroundings. The aircraft, primarily white with small visible windows and metallic sections featuring rivets and a distinct nose, is positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the middle ground with its side facing the viewer. The text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" is visible on its side, indicating its purpose. Surrounding the aircraft, a cloud of smoke or mist fills the air, primarily in the middle ground. Several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"N\" symbols, are situated in the bottom left corner of the frame. Overhead industrial lights illuminate the scene from above, casting a warm glow throughout. Metal beams and structural elements of the hangar form the background. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing the scene from a low angle, looking up at the airplane, and maintains a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp. Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits noticeable shaking, adding a sense of instability to the footage. An explosion occurs outside the hangar, followed by the large cargo plane moving forward rapidly. The plane crashes through the hangar's large windowed structure, causing the high ceiling with metal beams to collapse and shattering the windows, sending debris flying as it enters the building. Smoke billows around the front section of the aircraft as it continues its forward movement into the hangar. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the middle section of the aircraft. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the aircraft's details. The cargo containers remain in the same position relative to the aircraft, maintaining their size due to the change in shot size.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera positioned at eye level, capturing the scene from a low angle, looking up at the airplane. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp. Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits noticeable shaking, adding a sense of instability to the footage.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a large cargo plane prominently positioned within an indoor setting. The aircraft is primarily white with small visible windows and metallic sections featuring rivets and a distinct nose. It bears the text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" on its side, indicating its purpose. The plane is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process occurring around it. In the foreground, there are several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"N\" symbols, indicating their contents or handling instructions. The scene is illuminated by overhead industrial lights, casting a warm glow over the entire area. The setting appears to be a hangar or a similar facility, emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a large hangar-like structure at night, featuring a massive aircraft crashing into the hangar, causing it to collapse.. The environment is industrial, with metal beams and bright overhead lights illuminating the scene. The aircraft, with its metallic surface, dominates the space, while smoke or mist envelops parts of it, creating a dynamic atmosphere. Two unidentified labeled objects are prominently visible in the midground, adding to the industrial feel. The scene is characterized by a warm color palette, with the lighting casting a yellowish hue over the area. ",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
