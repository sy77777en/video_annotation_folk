  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a cityscape, prominently featuring a tall red brick and glass building in the central portion of the frame. The building's vertical lines and balconies extend upwards, with the camera positioned slightly below, looking up towards its upper floors. The camera drone, exhibiting noticeable fisheye distortion, starts with a slightly low angle, panning left and moving forward to a level angle, highlighting the details of the balconies and interior lights. As the camera pans left, it also tilts slightly downward, causing the building to shift towards the right side of the frame and revealing more of the surrounding urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes, which appear smaller due to their distance. The camera then tilts upward, focusing on the upper sections of the main building to emphasize its height. The drone performs a complex stunt, quickly tilting up to return to a low angle and diving upward with a clockwise roll. As it continues rolling, the camera drone reverses direction, smoothly transitioning into an upside-down high angle view. In the final sequence, the camera rotates to provide a downward view, offering a bird's-eye perspective of the ground and surrounding structures. The setting is outdoors at dusk, with reflections of the fading daylight visible on the glass surfaces. The sky transitions from a muted blue to a darker hue, indicating the approach of night. Streetlights and interior lights begin to illuminate, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cool tones of the evening sky. Throughout the sequence, the building remains the focal point, transitioning from a close-up perspective to a broader aerial view, while the camera maintains a consistent height relative to the building, capturing the urban landscape dynamically.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera drone uses deep focus with a large depth of field. It starts with a slightly low angle, performing a complex stunt, panning left and moving forward to a level angle, then quickly tilting up to return to a low angle and diving upward with a clockwise roll. As it continues rolling, the camera drone reverses direction, smoothly transitioning into an upside-down high angle view. The movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the towering presence of a red brick and glass building, emphasizing its height and architectural details. The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the building's vertical lines and the surrounding city structures. The perspective highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The lighting and angles contribute to the dynamic and immersive feel of the urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video starts with a wide shot of a tall building featuring a red brick facade and large glass windows, highlighting the details of the balconies and interior lights. The camera initially pans left and moves forward, gradually revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape in the background. As the camera continues to rotate and tilt, it offers different perspectives of the urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective shifts further, showing the building from a different angle, with the camera now capturing the lower part of the building and the street below.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a cityscape at dusk. The setting is outdoors, featuring a tall, modern residential building with a red brick facade and large glass windows. Balconies protrude from the structure, adding depth and texture. The building's vertical lines and geometric shapes are prominent, with reflections of the fading daylight visible on the glass surfaces. As the camera pans left, it captures urban scenes featuring multiple high-rise buildings and cranes, hinting at a densely built environment. The sky transitions from a muted blue to a darker hue, indicating the approach of night. Streetlights and interior lights begin to illuminate, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cool tones of the evening sky. As the camera continues to move, it refocuses on the main building and concludes with a bird's-eye view of the ground, also highlighting the surrounding structures. The drone's movement provides a dynamic perspective, showcasing the height and scale of the architecture against the urban backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
