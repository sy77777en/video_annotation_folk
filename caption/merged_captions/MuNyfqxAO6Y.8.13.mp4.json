  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot is framed by dark, out-of-focus car interior elements in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. In the middle ground, a vertical black bar with visible stitching is located in the center of the frame, with a small orange light positioned behind and to the right of it. The background consists of bright, overexposed car windows, with a larger one on the right and a smaller one visible on the left, creating a distinct sense of depth. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the roll cage bar in the midground and executes a very smooth, minor counterclockwise arc, while still exhibiting a very subtle, slight shake. The shot is framed by the dark, out-of-focus shapes of the car's interior, possibly the seats or pillars, which have a strong green tint. Through the car's windows, the outside is a bright, overexposed white expanse. A small, glowing orange interior light is visible in the background.",

    "Camera": "This low-angle shot, filmed from inside a car, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a roll cage bar in the midground. The camera performs a very smooth, minor counterclockwise arc.",
    "Subject": "A close-up, stylized view from inside a vehicle highlights a black, vertical bar, likely part of a roll cage. The bar has a textured surface with a visible seam of stitching running down its length. The shot is framed by the dark, out-of-focus shapes of the car's interior, possibly the seats or pillars, which have a strong green tint. Through the car's windows, the outside is a bright, overexposed white expanse. A small, glowing orange interior light is visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "The video presents a close-up view from inside a vehicle, with the camera executing a very smooth, subtle counterclockwise arc, despite the lack of discernible movement from the car's interior or the scene outside.",
    "Scene": "From inside a vehicle, the view is framed by dark, out-of-focus interior elements with a greenish tint. A central, vertical black bar, part of a roll cage, is in focus, revealing a textured surface with a line of stitching running down its length. Through the car's side and rear windows, a bright, overexposed daytime scene is visible. A small, glowing orange light is also present within the dark interior of the car.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot is framed by dark, out-of-focus car interior elements in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
