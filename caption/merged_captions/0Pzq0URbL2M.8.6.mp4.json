  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static medium shot focused on a dark scene, with a smooth zoom-out transitioning into a full view of a dark, irregularly shaped object with a rough, crumpled texture, resembling a piece of rock or thick, folded fabric. The object is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground within a dimly lit enclosure, possibly a box. Light filters in from the left through horizontal slats, casting highlights on the object's uneven surface while leaving much of it in deep shadow. The edges of the enclosure are visible on the left and right, defining the foreground and middle ground space. Deep shadows occupy the right side of the frame and the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject, looking down into the enclosure, and executes a very smooth, slow upward pedestal movement. The video begins with a full shot of the object, which is initially illuminated by the light coming through the slats. As the camera slowly moves backward, the object remains the central focus, with its texture and shape becoming more apparent. The light continues to highlight the object, creating a contrast between the illuminated and shadowed areas. The background remains dark, emphasizing the object's details and the light's effect on it. The camera movement is steady and deliberate, maintaining the object in the center of the frame throughout the sequence. The overall color palette is muted and dominated by dark tones and shadows, contrasted by the brighter light filtering through the slats. The focus seems deep, but the darkness of the background prevents confirmation.",

    "Camera": "The camera appears to be positioned in a bird's eye view, though the lack of background context makes both the angle and height uncertain. It executes a very smooth, slow upward pedestal movement. The focus seems deep, but the darkness of the background prevents confirmation.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a dark, irregularly shaped object with a rough, crumpled texture, resembling a piece of rock or thick, folded fabric. It is positioned inside a dimly lit enclosure, possibly a box, with light filtering in from the left through horizontal slats, casting highlights on the object's uneven surface while leaving much of it in deep shadow.",

    "Scene": "The video shows a static indoor scene, presented from an objective point of view. The setting is very dark, focusing on an object within a confined, box-like space. Light enters from the left through horizontal slats, illuminating a central object that appears to be made of a dark, heavily crumpled material with a rough, stone-like texture. The object fills much of the visible space within the enclosure, casting deep shadows. The overall color palette is muted and dominated by dark tones and shadows, contrasted by the brighter light filtering through the slats.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a static medium shot focused on a dark scene, with a smooth zoom-out transitioning into a full view of the object positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. To the left, light filters through horizontal slats, illuminating the object. The edges of an enclosure are visible on the left and right, defining the foreground and middle ground space. Deep shadows occupy the right side of the frame and the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject, looking down into the enclosure."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
