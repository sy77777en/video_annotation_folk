  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, two adult lionesses with tawny, light brown fur and muscular builds walk side-by-side from the middle ground, positioned in the center-left and center of the frame. Initially, one cub is partially visible behind the left lioness, and another is behind the right one. The scene is set in a wide, open savanna under the soft, even light of dawn or dusk, with a light-brown dirt path cutting through a landscape of patchy green grass extending into the background. As the pride moves forward along the dirt path in the middle ground, the cub on the right emerges into view, briefly climbing onto the back of the lioness on the left while walking behind her. Two additional cubs, sharing the same tawny fur color as the adults, run in from the background on the right to join the group. The pride comes to a halt in the middle ground, with the two lionesses standing in the center, one cub positioned in front of them, and the other cubs grouped behind and to their right. The lionesses maintain similar positions, walking side by side with alert expressions and their mouths slightly open. The camera, from a high, hip-level angle, maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the lions in the midground in sharp focus. The smooth camera movement begins with a pan to the left, followed by a slight pan right to center the approaching lion pride, after which it remains static, capturing the lions at eye level throughout the shot. The two lionesses and the initial cubs then stop and stand still, facing forward, while the other two cubs continue to move around them.",

    "Subject": "Two adult lionesses with tawny, light brown fur and muscular builds walk forward, initially accompanied by two small lion cubs. As they move, two additional cubs join them. The lionesses maintain similar positions, walking side by side with alert expressions and their mouths slightly open. The cubs, sharing the same tawny fur color as the adults, follow closely. At the beginning, one cub climbs onto the back of the lioness on the left while walking behind her, and another walks behind.\n\n\n",
    "Motion": "Two adult lionesses walk forward side-by-side on a dirt path. A small cub follows behind the lioness on the right, while another cub walks behind the lioness on the left, briefly climbing onto her back. As they proceed, two more cubs run in from the right to join the group. The two lionesses and the initial cubs then stop and stand still, facing forward, while the other two cubs continue to move around them.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a wide, open savanna under the soft, even light of dawn or dusk. A light-brown dirt path cuts through a landscape of patchy green grass that extends into the background. A pride of lions, including two adult lionesses and several small cubs, walks along the path, moving across the terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
