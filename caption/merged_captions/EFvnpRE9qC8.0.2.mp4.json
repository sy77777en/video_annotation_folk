  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with long, dark hair is shown from the back, her silhouette positioned in the center foreground. She appears to be wearing a light-colored top with thin straps. A large, hazy full moon is visible in the top left background, serving as the sole light source in the dark outdoor setting at night. A structure, possibly a ledge, extends across the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot. Initially, the woman faces to the left, silhouetted against the moon, before turning to face it as strands of her long hair blow gently in the wind. The camera starts with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the silhouetted woman in the foreground. As the scene progresses, the camera's focus shifts, causing her silhouette and the moon behind her to blur. The shot has a slight unsteadiness throughout and softens at the very end, when the entire image blurs.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot. The camera starts with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the silhouetted woman in the foreground, but during the rack focus transition, the entire scene becomes out of focus.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, dark hair is seen from the back, her body rendered as a silhouette against a large, glowing moon in the dark night sky. She appears to be wearing a light-colored top with thin straps. Her arms are slightly outstretched to her sides as she stands facing away from the viewer, looking towards the moon. A few strands of her hair are seen blowing in the wind.",

    "Scene": "In a dark outdoor setting at night, a large, hazy full moon hangs in the sky. In the foreground, the silhouette of a person with long, dark hair is seen from behind. The person's hair flutters slightly as the scene remains dimly lit, with the moon as the sole light source.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
