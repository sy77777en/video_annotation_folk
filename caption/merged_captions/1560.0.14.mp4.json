  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle wide shot, looking directly straight down the center of a long, narrow hallway, possibly within a hotel or apartment complex. The walls, painted a neutral beige with white trim and molding, frame the shot on all sides, creating a receding perspective toward the distant wall at the end of the hallway, which is positioned in the center background. Rectangular light fixtures are visible on the ceiling. A poster covered with a reflective plastic or glass material is visible there. The camera, from an eye-level perspective, moves forward rapidly through the hallway while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, creating a disorienting and varying Dutch angle. This fast-motion video features a very smooth, quick camera movement, with a deep focus keeping the entire environment sharp. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, causing the surrounding walls and light fixtures to streak with motion blur, radiating from the center of the frame. As the camera advances, the distant wall rushes toward the foreground, briefly revealing details like the poster, a green emergency exit sign, and a glowing screen in the center before the entire frame is consumed by the blur of motion. This effectively transitions to an extreme close-up on the rapidly approaching surface, conveying the immense horizontal scale and creating a disorienting sense of motion within the architectural space.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion video features a very smooth, quick camera movement. From an eye-level perspective, the camera moves forward through a hallway while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, creating a disorienting and varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dizzying architectural scenery shot, capturing a rapid, vertiginous journey along the hallway of a tall, narrow building, resembling a hotel or apartment complex. The camera's first-person perspective propels swiftly forward, causing the beige walls, accented with white molding and intermittent light fixtures, to blur into streaks. Far ahead, a lower floor comes into view, revealing details like a poster and a green emergency exit sign. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its primary purpose is to convey the immense horizontal scale and create a disorienting sense of motion within the architectural space.",
    "Motion": "This video offers a thrilling, first-person perspective sprinting through a long, narrow hallway. The walls are a neutral, light color, accented by rectangular light fixtures. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, with details like a poster and an exit sign becoming visible in the distance.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a rapid forward view through a long hallway, creating a dizzying effect. The walls, painted a neutral beige with white trim and molding, blur due to the swift motion. Rectangular light fixtures are visible on the ceiling. At the end of the hallway, a poster protected by a glass or reflective cover, a green exit sign, and a glowing screen are briefly discernible before the view is completely obscured by the motion blur.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle wide shot, looking directly straight down the center of a hallway, possibly within a hotel. The walls frame the shot on all sides, creating a receding perspective toward the distant wall at the end of the hallway, which is positioned in the center background. A poster covered with a reflective plastic or glass material is visible there. The camera then moves forward rapidly and rotates counterclockwise. This movement causes the surrounding walls and light fixtures to streak with motion blur, radiating from the center of the frame. As the camera advances, the distant wall rushes toward the foreground, briefly revealing the poster and an exit sign in the center before the entire frame is consumed by the blur of motion, effectively transitioning to an extreme close-up on the rapidly approaching surface."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
