  "merged_caption": "This level-angle video begins with a full shot of a 3D-rendered male figure with short, dark hair and a metallic, grey skin tone, wearing a light grey, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. He stands with his back to the viewer on a white, rounded platform marked with black, wavy lines resembling wood grain, located in the center and right-center foreground. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk with a large, blank vertical screen. A large, patterned sphere is to the right in the middle ground, and another partial sphere is in the bottom left foreground. The figure walks a short distance toward the kiosk, and the shot transitions to a medium full shot, with both the figure and the kiosk in the center of the frame. The camera, at eye-level and using a shallow depth of field, moves smoothly forward and down, focusing on the person as they stand in front of the large screen. The minimalist, abstract space is set against a dark gray gradient background, enhancing the stylized composition.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level and level angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the person in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly forward and down, approaching the person as they stand in front of a large screen.",
    "Subject": "A 3D-rendered male figure with short, dark hair and a metallic, grey skin tone stands with his back to the viewer. He is wearing a light grey, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that has a large, blank, vertical screen. He walks closely toward the machine and pauses in front of it.",
    "Motion": "A 3D-rendered male figure, seen from behind, walks a short distance toward a tall, white kiosk and then stops directly in front of it.",
    "Scene": "In a minimalist, abstract space against a dark gray gradient background, a stylized figure stands on a white, rounded platform. This platform, along with other large spherical shapes in the scene, is marked with black, wavy lines resembling wood grain. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that features a large, blank vertical screen.",
    "Spatial": "This level-angle video begins with a full shot of a 3D figure and a kiosk located in the center and right-center foreground. The figure stands on a patterned platform that occupies the bottom of the frame, with a large, patterned sphere to the right in the middle ground and another partial sphere in the bottom left foreground. As the figure walks a short distance toward the kiosk, the shot transitions to a medium full shot, with both the figure and the kiosk in the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
