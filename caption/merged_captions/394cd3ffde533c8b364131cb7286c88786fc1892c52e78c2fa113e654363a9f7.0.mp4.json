  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a person riding a motorcycle, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. The rider is centrally framed, wearing a black helmet with a reflective visor, a black leather jacket with gray accents, and black gloves. The motorcycle is dark-colored, and the handlebars are visible in the foreground. The setting initially includes a busy street with parked cars and ancient architecture in the background. As the scene progresses, the environment transitions to a tree-lined road with residential buildings on both sides, indicating movement through different urban areas. The rider maintains a steady posture, occasionally glancing to the side, possibly checking for traffic or navigating through the environment. The motorcycle's dashboard and handlebars are visible, with a logo on the right handlebar grip. The rider continues to move smoothly through the traffic, passing by different types of vehicles, including cars, buses, and a DHL truck. The camera, mounted on the front of the motorcycle and facing the driver, moves backward relative to the scene as the motorcycle advances. It features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a level angle, looking straight ahead, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. With each turn, the camera slightly pans and rolls, creating dynamic motion. The camera is slightly unsteady with some shaking and leads the motorcyclist from the front. The setting changes from a more open area with other vehicles visible to a tree-lined street, indicating movement through different environments. The time of day is daytime, with clear skies and scattered clouds, and the surroundings include a mix of modern and older architecture, with bare trees indicating a colder season.",

    "Subject": "The video features a person riding a motorcycle. The rider is wearing a black helmet with a reflective visor, obscuring their face. They are dressed in a black leather jacket with gray accents and black gloves. The motorcycle is dark-colored, and the rider is positioned upright, holding the handlebars. The setting changes from a more open area with other vehicles visible to a tree-lined street, indicating movement through different environments.",
    "Motion": "The rider, dressed in a black leather jacket and black gloves, is seen riding a motorcycle through different streets. The background transitions from a busy road with multiple cars to a more residential area with trees and parked vehicles. The rider maintains a steady posture, occasionally glancing to the side, possibly checking for traffic or navigating through the environment. The motorcycle's dashboard and handlebars are visible, with a logo on the right handlebar grip. The rider continues to move smoothly through the traffic, passing by different types of vehicles, including cars, buses, and a DHL truck.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a motorcycle, capturing a dynamic ride through an urban environment. The setting is outdoors, transitioning from a busy street with parked cars and buildings to a tree-lined road. The time of day is daytime, with clear skies and scattered clouds. The rider, wearing a black helmet and leather jacket, is central to the scene, with the handlebars and part of the motorcycle visible. The surroundings include a mix of modern and older architecture, with bare trees indicating a colder season. The movement includes some noticeable bumps as the motorcycle navigates through traffic and along the road.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium shot of a person riding a motorcycle, with the camera positioned at the subject's level.

As the scene progresses, the environment transitions to a tree-lined road with residential buildings on both sides, indicating movement through different urban areas. The rider remains in the center throughout, maintaining a consistent position relative to the camera, capturing the dynamic ride."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
