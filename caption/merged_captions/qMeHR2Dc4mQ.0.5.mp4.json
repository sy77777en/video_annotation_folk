  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man's face, consistently positioned in the center foreground against a dark background. The man has light skin, short dark curly hair, dark eyes, a dark mustache, and some stubble on his chin. A small, light-colored blemish is visible on his right cheek. He wears a dark, possibly green or black, jacket, with only the collar visible at the bottom of the frame. The scene is set in a very dark environment, with the background appearing almost entirely black, suggesting an indoor setting at night or a space with minimal illumination. The lighting is dim, focused primarily on the man's face. Initially, the man looks directly forward with a neutral expression. His gaze then briefly shifts to his right (the viewer's left) before returning to look forward again. At the end of the video, he speaks. The camera is at a level angle and uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. It shows some minor, slow, and smooth backward movement with minimal shaking, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a very dark environment, with the background appearing almost entirely black. The lighting is dim, focused primarily on a man's face, which is centered in the shot. The man has dark, curly hair and a mustache. His eyes shift slightly during the video. The overall impression is of an indoor setting at night or a space with minimal illumination.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
