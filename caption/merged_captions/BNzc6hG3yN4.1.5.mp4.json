  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's face, positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. The individual has a medium to dark skin tone and short hair, seen in low lighting that casts shadows across their features. The lighting creates a warm, intimate atmosphere, emphasizing the details of the person's facial features. The background is dark, providing minimal context. As the video progresses, the camera rotates counter-clockwise and gradually moves closer, transitioning to an extreme close-up, focusing on the person's eye, which is now positioned slightly to the right of the center. This change in shot size enhances the detail of the eye, capturing reflections of light within it, suggesting nearby illumination or distant city lights. The person remains in a contemplative pose, with slight mouth movements, while the camera maintains a consistent, bird-eye view, focusing on the facial features without revealing the background. The shallow focus effectively highlights the person's facial features, with the texture of the skin and subtle details like eyelashes visible, adding depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused, with minimal external elements to distract from the central subject.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a shallow focus, effectively highlighting the person's facial features. The camera rotates counter-clockwise and gradually moves closer, culminating in an extreme close-up of the eye.",
    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a person with medium to dark skin tone, focusing on their face. The individual has short hair and is seen in low lighting, which casts shadows across their features. The person's eye is prominently highlighted, reflecting some light, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The lighting creates a warm, intimate atmosphere, emphasizing the details of the person's facial features. The video captures the subject in a still, contemplative pose, with the focus primarily on their eye and surrounding facial area.",
    "Motion": "The person remains in a contemplative pose, with the focus primarily on their eye and surrounding facial area, while exhibiting slight mouth movements.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit environment, possibly at night, with a focus on a close-up view of a person's face. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and highlighting the contours of the face. The background is dark, providing little context about the surroundings. The person's eye is prominently featured, reflecting small points of light, suggesting nearby illumination or distant city lights. The texture of the skin and subtle details like eyelashes are visible, adding depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused, with minimal external elements to distract from the central subject.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
