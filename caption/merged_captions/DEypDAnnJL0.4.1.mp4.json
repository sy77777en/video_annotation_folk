  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on the silhouette of a person's head, visible in the foreground on the left, as they hold a phone to their ear. Initially, a framed picture with floral artwork is fully visible and positioned in the center of the frame in the background. This picture, set in a light-brown, possibly wooden, rectangular frame, contains a black and white artwork showing a single figure with a leaf for a head, holding a single red flower behind their back. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the background. As the camera moves smoothly to the left, the person lowers their arm, and the phone moves down and out of the frame. The silhouette appears to shift slightly from the left toward the center of the view due to camera movement. The person and the main framed picture shift towards the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a second, smaller, darker framed item, possibly a document, which enters from the left and becomes partially visible in the background, to the left of the main picture. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, likely a room, with a plain, light-colored wall. In the background, one of the framed pictures on the wall shakes, and another picture frame later falls off the wall.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a wall where a framed picture is prominently in focus. This picture, set in a light-brown, possibly wooden, rectangular frame, contains a black and white artwork showing a single figure with a leaf for a head, holding a single red flower behind their back. In the heavily blurred foreground, the dark silhouette of a person is visible from behind, initially holding a phone to their ear, which they later drop. Also in focus on the wall, to the left of the main picture, is a partially visible, smaller, darker black rectangular framed item that appears to be a document.",
    "Motion": "A heavily blurred silhouette of a person in the foreground initially holds a phone to their ear. The person then lowers their arm, and the phone moves down and out of the frame. Concurrently, the silhouette appears to shift slightly from the left toward the center of the view due to camera movement. In the background, one of the framed pictures on the wall shakes, and another picture frame later falls off the wall.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, likely a room, with a plain, light-colored wall. On this wall, a framed picture is visible. The picture, primarily in black and white, depicts a single figure with a leaf for a head, holding a red flower behind their back. The frame itself is simple and light brown. Entering from the left of the frame, another smaller, darker, and less distinct framed item is visible. In the foreground, the out-of-focus element is the back of a person's head as they hold a phone to their ear. The camera shifts slightly to the left, causing this figure's position in the frame to move to the right, revealing more of the wall and the pictures.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on the silhouette of a person's head, visible in the foreground on the left, as they hold a phone to their ear. Initially, a framed picture with floral artwork is fully visible and positioned in the center of the frame in the background.

This movement reveals a second, smaller, darker framed item, possibly a document, which enters from the left and becomes partially visible in the background, to the left of the main picture. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
