  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the front of a sled occupies the bottom center foreground, with a hand on a steering wheel visible in the bottom left foreground. The snowy path, marked with tracks, extends from the middle ground into the background, filling the lower two-thirds of the frame. This path is flanked by a large snowbank on the right and a snow-covered barrier on the left, both of which stretch from the middle ground into the background along the frame's edges. In the background, a dense forest spans the upper portion of the frame, with an overcast sky visible above the treeline. The camera, positioned at hip level, moves continuously forward at a steady pace, creating a dynamic where foreground elements pass quickly while the background remains more distant, emphasizing the sense of movement and depth. The slightly unsteady movement, with some shaking, enhances the dynamic experience of the descent. The sled, equipped with a steering wheel and a ski-like front, is ridden by a person whose legs are occasionally visible, indicating they are seated. The rider's hand is seen gripping the steering wheel as the sled moves along the track. The snow-covered path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, creating a wintery forest environment. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The road shows tracks from previous vehicles, indicating recent activity. The environment is serene, with the white snow contrasting against the dark green of the trees, creating a stark, wintry atmosphere. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene, capturing the serene yet dynamic experience of sledding through this snowy landscape.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a first-person perspective of a man sliding down a snowy slope. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing a predominantly high angle view, even with occasional upward tilts. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene. The slightly unsteady movement, with some shaking, enhances the dynamic experience of the descent.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a snowy landscape from a first-person point of view, showing a person riding a sled with a steering wheel and a ski-like front. The casual forward-facing perspective occasionally reveals the rider's legs. The snow-covered path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, conveying a sense of movement along a snowy track with the sled's tracks visible in the snow.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a person riding a sled on a snow-covered path, with the camera positioned to capture the view from their perspective. The sled has a steering wheel and a ski-like front, and the rider's legs are visible, indicating they are seated on the sled. The path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, creating a wintery forest environment. The rider's hand is seen gripping the steering wheel as the sled moves along the track.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting, likely a winter landscape. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall snowbanks on either side, with a dense forest of evergreen trees in the background. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The road shows tracks from previous vehicles, indicating recent activity. The viewer's perspective includes parts of a sled or similar vehicle, with a visible steering wheel. The viewer is moving forward along the snowy path. The environment is serene, with the white snow contrasting against the dark green of the trees, creating a stark, wintry atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
