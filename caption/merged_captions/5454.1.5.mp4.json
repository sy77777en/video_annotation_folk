  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle wide shot, a group of about ten young men is positioned horizontally across the middle of the frame, standing in the middle ground on an elevated walkway. The camera is static, looking up at the group on a balcony, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. A black metal railing runs in front of them, also in the middle ground. The man in the center, leaning on the railing, wears a black and white patterned puffer jacket over dark pants, and is more noticeable as he makes hand gestures. To his right, a man in a bright blue puffer jacket and light-wash jeans also makes a hand gesture. Almost everyone else in the group is making hand gestures or slightly moving their hands. The rest of the men are dressed in dark winter attire, primarily black and grey hooded jackets and sweatshirts, with some hoods pulled up. One man on the far right wears sunglasses. In the middle ground, a white sign is fixed to a concrete wall at the bottom center of the frame, reading \"NO BALL GAMES\" in black capital letters. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left, situated in the middle ground, while an overcast, pale grey-blue sky fills the upper half of the frame as the background. A blurred yellow glow is visible at the bottom center of the frame, part of the foreground. The scene is composed of vertical bars of the black metal railing running along the edge of the grey concrete structure. The background is dominated by the overcast sky, with the bare branches of a tree visible in the upper left corner. The camera tilts up slightly toward the group of men gathered on the elevated walkway, capturing the dynamics of their hand movements.",

    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, the scene looks up at an outdoor concrete walkway of a building, where a group of people in winter clothing are gathered behind black metal railings. The railings, composed of vertical bars, run along the edge of the grey concrete structure. Affixed to the concrete wall below the railing is a white rectangular sign with black text that reads \"NO BALL GAMES\". The background is dominated by an overcast, pale grey-blue sky, with the bare branches of a tree visible in the upper left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
