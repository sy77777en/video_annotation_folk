  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a low angle, featuring a large, pod-shaped vehicle in the top left and a smaller, rectangular device in the foreground to its right, connected by a thin tether against a dark, textured background. The underside of the boat appears black on the port side and illuminated white on the starboard side, with a rounded nose. The smaller, gray, cylindrical device, a sensor array, is deployed and lowered into a dark, deep-water environment. As it descends toward the bottom of the frame, the larger vehicle exits the frame from the top left due to the camera movement. The camera pulls back and moves downward while tilting down, transitioning the shot from a low-angle view of the sonar device being deployed to a wider, level-angle view. The sensor emits two wide, flat, conical beams of light downwards, illuminating and scanning across a dark, textured surface below, revealing a small, dark, oblong object resting on the seabed. The camera follows the descending device while pulling back, transitioning into an extreme wide shot. In the final view, the smaller device is suspended in the top center, with the camera now at its height, emitting two wide beams of light that illuminate the textured surface filling the bottom of the frame, where a small, dark object rests in the bottom left. The device and the vehicle it's attached to remain in sharp focus throughout the movement, effectively scanning the grey ocean floor below.",

    "Camera": "With a smooth motion, the camera pulls back and moves downward while tilting down. This action transitions the shot from a low-angle view of a sonar device being deployed to a wider, level-angle view of it scanning the dark seafloor. The device and the vehicle it's attached to remain in sharp focus throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "The video shows the underside of a boat, appearing black on the port side and illuminated white on the starboard side, with a rounded nose. Connected to the boat by a thin, white tether is a smaller, gray, cylindrical device that appears to be a sensor array. The smaller device is deployed from the boat and is shown being lowered into a dark space. It then emits two wide, flat beams of light downwards, illuminating and scanning a dark, textured surface below, where a small, dark, oblong object is visible.",
    "Motion": "A small, rectangular device, connected by a long tether to a larger, pod-shaped vehicle, is deployed and lowered. As it descends into a dark space, it emits two wide, conical beams downwards, which illuminate and scan across a dark, textured surface below, revealing a small, oblong object.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, deep-water environment, a streamlined, white and black submersible is tethered by a long, thin cable to the underside of a boat. The sensor descends into the dark abyss, where it emits wide, conical beams that scan the textured, grey ocean floor below, revealing a small, dark object resting on the seabed.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
