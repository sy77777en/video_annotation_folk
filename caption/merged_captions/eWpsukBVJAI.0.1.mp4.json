  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot at the subjects' level, showing a fair-skinned man with short brown hair in a black leather jacket on the right, a taller man with curly brown hair and glasses in a brown suit in the center, and a man with long dark hair and a beard in a patterned jacket on the left, all positioned in the middle ground. The man in the leather jacket gestures with his left hand while holding a foamy beer, as the man with long hair drinks from a green bottle. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts slightly down, transitioning to a high-angle view as a man in a hoodie enters the frame from the left foreground and exits the frame from the right foreground. This movement reveals a group of people sitting in a booth, including a woman with long blonde hair and a black beanie next to a woman with dark hair, glasses, and tattoos on her arm, both holding drinks. A man in a brown suit throws a handful of food into the air, which then falls down onto the people seated in the booth, who are frozen in laughter and reaction to the shower of food. The camera angle shifts to an overhead position, revealing the two women in the booth in the middle ground, with additional booths visible in the background. The shot continues to pan left from this high angle, repositioning the man in the leather jacket to the left middle ground and the man in the suit to the center-left middle ground, while the two women are now in the right foreground. The scene is set at night inside a dimly lit bar with dark wood-paneled walls, illuminated by warm, yellow light, including a small, green-shaded lamp over one of the tables.",

    "Subject": "A fair-skinned man with short brown hair, wearing a black leather jacket over a collared shirt and tie with a badge on a chain, sits on the right, gesturing with one hand while holding a foamy glass of beer. Next to him stands a taller, fair-skinned man with curly brown hair and glasses, dressed in a brown suit, a white shirt, and a striped tie. To the left, another man with long dark hair and a beard, wearing a patterned jacket over a green shirt, drinks from a green bottle. In a booth, a woman with long blonde hair and a black beanie sits next to a woman with dark hair, glasses, and tattoos on her arm; both hold drinks. Other people, including a man with a grey beard and another man in a white shirt, are visible in the background, laughing and socializing.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set at night inside a dimly lit bar with dark wood-paneled walls. People are gathered in booths that have green upholstered benches. The space is illuminated by warm, yellow light, including a small, green-shaded lamp over one of the tables. A framed picture hangs on the wall. Patrons hold beer bottles and glasses, with one glass overflowing with foam. In one booth, a small bowl of snacks is visible on the table. The camera moves through the space, revealing more of the patrons as small, yellow, cube-shaped objects are tossed into the air.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
