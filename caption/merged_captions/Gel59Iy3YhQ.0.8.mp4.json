  "merged_caption": "In a wide, top-down shot of a 2D video game set in an outdoor, snowy landscape rendered in a pixel art style, a pixelated, human-like character with brown, shoulder-length hair and yellowish skin is depicted wearing a purple and blue striped shirt. This character is initially positioned in the center of the frame, with a round, white snowball below and to the right. A snow-covered pine tree is visible in the top right corner, while dark, rocky cliffs frame the bottom corners. The ground is a light blue expanse of snow, forming stepped platforms. The character stands still before moving horizontally to the right, and as they descend, the camera smoothly follows, scrolling to the right and then downward. This movement keeps the human character centered while repositioning the snowball to the left center. As the view scrolls, it reveals more of the snowy terrain and a second character, a short, pixelated skeleton with a wide, grinning skull, dressed in a blue, unzipped hoodie over a white shirt and black shorts, standing barefoot on a ledge in the upper right corner. The human-like character continues to move downward and remains on the screen, while the camera continues to follow their movement, maintaining the character's central position in the frame.",
  "input_captions": {
    "Camera": "In a 2D video game, the camera smoothly follows the main character as they move rightward and downward, kicking a ball.",
    "Subject": "A pixelated human-like character with brown, shoulder-length hair and yellowish skin is depicted wearing a purple and blue striped shirt. Near this character rests a round, white snowball. A second character, a short, pixelated skeleton, is also visible. This skeleton has a wide, grinning skull and is dressed in a blue, unzipped hoodie over a white shirt and black shorts, and is barefoot.",
    "Motion": "A pixelated, human-like character stands still in a snowy landscape. The character then moves horizontally to the right, and as they descend, the camera moves right and then downwards to reveal a stationary skeleton character standing on a ledge in the upper right corner. The human-like character continues to move downward and remains on the screen.",
    "Scene": "In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the scene is set in an outdoor, snowy landscape rendered in a pixel art style. The ground is a light blue expanse of snow, forming stepped platforms and bordered by dark, rocky cliffs. In the upper corner, a single pine tree is covered in snow. The view scrolls to the right and then downward, revealing more of the snowy terrain.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide, top-down shot, a human-like character is initially positioned in the center of the frame, with a snowball below and to the right. A snow-covered tree is visible in the top right corner, while dark cliffs frame the bottom corners. The frame then scrolls to the right and downwards, keeping the human character centered while repositioning the snowball to the left center. This movement reveals a skeleton character who appears in the top right of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
