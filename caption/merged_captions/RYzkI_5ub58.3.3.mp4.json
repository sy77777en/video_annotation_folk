  "merged_caption": "This medium shot features a black bird with a pointed, pale grey beak, facing left, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center and occupying the foreground. The bird has a distinct red patch on its wing, with a white stripe directly beneath the red patch, and its feathers appear somewhat textured, particularly around its neck. Green leaves are visible primarily at the bottom of the frame, surrounding the bird, indicating it is positioned within a plant or tree. The background consists of a clear, bright blue sky that fills the upper portion of the scene, suggesting the setting is outdoors during the daytime. The camera is at a low angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the bird in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, and the framing remains static throughout the video. The bird remains mostly still, with its body and head largely motionless. Initially, its beak is closed, but it begins to open and close repeatedly, as if calling or singing.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a black bird with a pointed, pale grey beak. The bird has a distinct red patch on its wing, with a white stripe directly beneath the red patch. Its feathers appear somewhat textured, particularly around its neck. The bird is perched, facing towards the left, with its head level. Below and around the bird are several green leaves, indicating it is positioned within a plant or tree.",
    "Motion": "The video features a black bird with a pointed, pale grey beak, perched on a branch with green leaves against a clear blue sky. The bird remains mostly still, with its body and head largely motionless. Initially, its beak is closed, but it begins to open and close repeatedly, as if calling or singing.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a black bird with a white beak and a red and white patch on its wing, perched among green leaves against a clear, bright blue sky. The setting is outdoors during the daytime.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot features a black bird, facing left, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center and occupying the foreground. Green leaves are visible primarily at the bottom of the frame, surrounding the bird. The background consists of a clear, bright blue sky that fills the upper portion of the scene. The camera appears to be below the subject, though the lack of background information makes this difficult to determine with certainty. The framing remains static throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
