  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot features a person with brown, wavy hair and light skin, seen from a side-rear view, primarily occupying the left and central area of the frame and positioned in the foreground. They are wearing a light-colored t-shirt and holding a compact, dark green, rectangular phone with rounded edges to their right ear; the phone is located in the center-left of the frame, also in the foreground. The phone's earpiece and a small, dark, circular indentation on its back near the top are visible. To the right and slightly behind the person, a portion of a dark computer monitor is visible on the right side of the frame, situated in the middle ground, displaying a complex, light-colored interface against a dark background. The entire scene is illuminated by a strong yellowish-green light, affecting the coloration of all subjects. A small text overlay displaying \"27\" is located in the very bottom left corner. The person and the phone they are holding to their ear remain still throughout the video. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field with the focus on the foreground. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

    "Scene": "An objective POV shot captures an indoor scene illuminated by a distinct yellowish-green light. A person with brown, wavy hair is depicted from the back and side, holding a small, dark green, rectangular phone to their ear. To the right, a computer monitor is visible, displaying a complex, light-colored interface against a dark background. A small text overlay displaying \"27\" is located in the very bottom left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
