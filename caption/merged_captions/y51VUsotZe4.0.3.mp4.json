  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a bird's-eye view, top-down perspective, filmed by a drone. Initially, the frame is centered on a city block at night, with a building featuring a brightly lit roof occupying the top center-left. Darker buildings are positioned on the left and right, while a grid of streets with moving car lights fills the lower portion of the frame. The camera features a smooth drone POV, moving backward and to the right, then transitioning to moving only backward, revealing the illuminated streets and buildings below. As it moves, a tall skyscraper enters the frame from the bottom right, accompanied by a powerful, bright light source at its base that creates a prominent flare in the bottom right quadrant. The dark silhouettes of skyscrapers are visible against the black sky, with streets forming a grid below, active with the white headlights of moving vehicles. One building has a rooftop outlined by a pattern of warm, glowing lights. As the view shifts, a powerful, cool-toned light emanates from the bottom of a tall skyscraper, creating a bright flare that illuminates the immediate vicinity. By the end of the shot, the initial lit-roof building disappears from the top left, and the newly revealed, illuminated skyscraper occupies the bottom right. The emphasis is on the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, capturing the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire city scene sharp, with no main subject, as the camera's detached, bird's-eye perspective emphasizes the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city rather than any individual element.",

    "Camera": "This video features a smooth drone POV from a bird's-eye view, capturing a cityscape at night from an aerial level. The camera initially moves backward and to the right, then transitions to moving only backward. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire city scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a top-down aerial cityscape scenery shot at night, capturing the sprawling urban environment from a high vantage point. The scene is dominated by the dark silhouettes of skyscrapers and the glowing grid of streets below, where the headlights and taillights of cars create streams of moving light. One building features a brightly lit roof with a distinct pattern of lights, while another towering skyscraper is illuminated from below, its structured, lit spire becoming increasingly prominent. There is no main subject, as the camera's detached, bird's-eye perspective emphasizes the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city rather than any individual element.",
    "Motion": "This video features a slow, top-down aerial shot of a city at night. The camera moves rightwards and backwards, revealing the illuminated streets and buildings below. The emphasis is on the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, capturing the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down perspective of a dense city at night. The dark silhouettes of skyscrapers are visible against the black sky, with streets forming a grid below. The streets are active with the white headlights of moving vehicles. One building has a rooftop outlined by a pattern of warm, glowing lights. As the view shifts, a powerful, cool-toned light emanates from the bottom of a tall skyscraper, creating a bright flare that illuminates the immediate vicinity.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a bird's-eye view, top-down perspective. Initially, the frame is centered on a city block at night, with a building featuring a brightly lit roof occupying the top center-left. Darker buildings are positioned on the left and right, while a grid of streets with moving car lights fills the lower portion of the frame. The camera then slowly pulls rightwards and backwards, revealing more of the cityscape. As it moves, a tall skyscraper enters the frame from the bottom right, accompanied by a powerful, bright light source at its base that creates a prominent flare in the bottom right quadrant. By the end of the shot, the initial lit-roof building disappears from the top left, and the newly revealed, illuminated skyscraper occupies the bottom right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
