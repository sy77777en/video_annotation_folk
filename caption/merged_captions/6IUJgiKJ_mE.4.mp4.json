  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of two cyclists on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left, wearing a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, is initially positioned at the bottom left, moving towards the center left of the frame, while the cyclist on the right, in a white and black jersey, is in the center right. The cyclist on the left is in the foreground, while the cyclist on the right is in the middle ground, both moving away from the viewer. The road stretches into the background, with vehicles and people visible along the roadside, indicating a race or event. The camera is positioned at eye level and angled high, looking down at the cyclists. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward to follow the cyclists, adding a slight pan to the right at the end. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Both cyclists are pedaling steadily, maintaining a consistent pace. The cyclist in the yellow and black jersey is on the left, while the cyclist in the white and black jersey is slightly ahead on the right. In the background, there are several vehicles parked on the left side of the road, and a few people are standing near these vehicles, possibly spectators or event staff. The road is straight and stretches into the distance, with a clear sky and open fields on both sides. The camera captures the expansive rural landscape with grassy fields on either side. The road's straight path and the cyclists' movement create a sense of progression and depth within the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.",

    "Subject": "The video features two cyclists riding on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left wears a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, black shorts, and a helmet. The cyclist on the right wears a white and black jersey, black shorts, and a helmet, riding a bicycle with a dark frame.

In the distance, several vehicles and people are visible along the roadside, indicating a race or organized event. The road is straight and stretches into the horizon, flanked by grassy fields.",
    "Motion": "Two cyclists, one in a yellow and black jersey and the other in a white and black jersey, are riding on a wide, open road. The cyclist in the yellow and black jersey is on the left, while the cyclist in the white and black jersey is slightly ahead on the right. Both cyclists are pedaling steadily, maintaining a consistent pace.

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a long, straight road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, indicating daytime. The setting is a rural area with open fields on either side, bordered by low vegetation and distant tree lines. The road is paved with a smooth surface, marked by yellow and white lines. Two cyclists are prominently featured, riding along the road, with their colorful jerseys and bicycles adding dynamic elements to the scene. Vehicles and a few people are visible in the background, suggesting a cycling event or race. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
