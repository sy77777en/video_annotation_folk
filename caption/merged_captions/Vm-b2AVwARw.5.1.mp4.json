  "merged_caption": "The video is a full shot, with the camera positioned at a high angle, looking down at a light brown, textured piece of paper resting on a dark brown wooden surface. The paper occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground, with the wooden surface visible at the frame's edges in the background. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire paper sharp. At the top center of the paper, the word \"Kafala\" is printed in black, bold, sans-serif font. Below this, in the top center area of the paper, a businessman icon in a suit and tie is positioned. A worker icon wearing a hard hat and overalls is located in the center of the paper. A dotted line with a chain link pattern connects the businessman icon above to the worker icon. To the right of this chain, near the top right relative to the worker, a black rectangular icon resembling a credit card is labeled \"VISA\" in white capital letters. Initially, a document icon with a small, indistinct image appears to the left of the worker. Then, a barred window icon appears to the bottom left of the worker. As the video progresses, a clock icon emerges to the right of the worker, with a passport icon below it at the bottom right, featuring a globe symbol on its cover. A clenched fist icon with zig-zag lines emanating from it materializes directly below the worker. Finally, an icon depicting a whip and a building with columns appears to the left of the businessman icon, near the top left relative to the worker. An overlay number \"[24]\" is visible in the bottom left of the frame. The camera initially focuses on the paper, then slowly and smoothly rises, simultaneously rolling clockwise around the paper to reveal more of its surface, enhancing the dynamic storytelling of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
