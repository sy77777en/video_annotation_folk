  "merged_caption": "A single, black-and-white line drawing remains consistently positioned in the center of the frame against a plain white background. The drawing undergoes a continuous series of transformations, morphing from one character to another while maintaining its central position and relative size. The sequence begins with a stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, conveying an angry expression. This figure then transforms into a sitting cat with pointed ears and a small smile, followed by a character resembling a crewmate from the game *Among Us* with its characteristic bean-like shape and large oval visor. Next, a cartoonish Tyrannosaurus Rex appears, depicted with a large head, sharp teeth, and small arms. The transformation continues into a short, grinning skeleton wearing a hooded jacket with its hands in the pockets, then into a small, cloaked figure with a horned head and large, black, circular eyes. Subsequently, a flower with a wide, sinister grin and black eyes in its center is shown. The final distinct character is a plant-like creature with a large, toothed mouth and wide eyes, which momentarily splits open before reassembling into the initial stylized human figure, concluding the sequence in the same central location where it began. The entire animation is presented from a direct, head-on perspective, with a stationary camera and any potential motion unclear due to the lack of background cues. The minimalist scene features only the black outlines of the characters visible against the featureless white expanse, with each character appearing briefly in a still pose before quickly transitioning to the next, creating a seamless morphing effect throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "Against a plain white background, a sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings continuously morphs from one form to another. The animation features a series of characters, including a stick figure, a cat, a small character in a spacesuit, a dinosaur, a skeleton in a jacket, a horned knight, and a flower with a face, each seamlessly transforming into the next. The entire scene is minimalist, with only the black outlines of the characters visible against the featureless white expanse.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
