  "merged_caption": "This video is a static, low-angle extreme wide shot of a cityscape scenery, capturing the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night. The iconic monument stands as the central element, positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame, brightly lit with white light that highlights its detailed carvings. A wide, wet cobblestone road extends from the bottom of the frame in the foreground, leading toward the monument. On either side of the road, trees with warm, golden foliage are illuminated by bright streetlights, situated in the middle ground. The primary dynamic within the static shot is the time-lapsed traffic, which creates continuous streaks of vibrant red, white, and blue light that flow along the road in the foreground and middle ground, adding a powerful sense of motion and energy. The camera employs a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and there is a very smooth, minor backward dolly movement throughout the clip. Prominently visible in the center of the frame, two white road divider lines add depth and guide the viewer's eye through the scene. The dark, wet pavement reflects the ambient light and the motion of traffic, enhancing the dynamic contrast with the static, sharply focused arch. In the bottom right corner, an overlay displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\". The composition focuses on capturing the overall atmosphere, scale, and ceaseless vitality of this iconic urban environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of the Arc de Triomphe at night, with traffic light trails blurring past. The shot is captured from ground level, looking directly at the monument. The camera employs a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. There is a very smooth, minor backward dolly movement throughout the clip.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot centered on the illuminated Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night. The grand, neoclassical monument stands at the end of a wet, reflective cobblestone road, flanked by trees with warm, golden foliage under bright streetlights. Prominently visible in the center of the frame, two white road divider lines add depth and guide the viewer's eye through the scene. The time-lapse effect transforms the headlights and taillights of passing vehicles into long, flowing streaks of white, blue, and red light, creating a powerful sense of motion and energy. The composition focuses on capturing the overall atmosphere, scale, and ceaseless vitality of the iconic urban environment.",
    "Motion": "This is a nighttime, long-exposure shot of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The iconic monument is brightly lit at the end of a wide, wet road, framed by trees with golden leaves. The long exposure captures the movement of traffic as vibrant streaks of red and white light, creating a dynamic contrast with the static, sharply focused arch.",
    "Scene": "A night scene captures the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, positioned centrally at the end of a wide, wet road. The large, stone monument is illuminated with white light, highlighting its detailed carvings. On either side of the road, trees with yellow leaves are lit by warm streetlights. The dark, wet pavement reflects the ambient light and the motion of traffic, which appears as continuous, blurred streaks of red and white light flowing towards and away from the arch. In the bottom right corner, an overlay displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",
    "Spatial": "This video is a static, low-angle extreme wide shot of a cityscape scenery. The Arc de Triomphe stands as the central element, positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame. A wide road extends from the bottom of the frame in the foreground, leading toward the monument in the middle ground. On the left and right sides of the frame, illuminated trees are situated in the middle ground. The primary dynamic within the static shot is the time-lapsed traffic, which creates continuous streaks of light that flow along the road in the foreground and middle ground. A text overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
