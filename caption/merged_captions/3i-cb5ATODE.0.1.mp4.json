  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium close-up shot of a woman with long, wavy blonde hair spread out behind her, wearing a dark green jacket over a white top and red lipstick with matching red nail polish, and a young man with short, neat brown hair. The young man is wearing a light yellow, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt with two small dark circular pins on his left chest. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame, and the young man is on the right, both appearing in the foreground. They are lying on a yellow couch patterned with black and white roosters with red accents, which occupies the space from the bottom of the frame to near the top in the middle ground. Behind them, a dark green wall is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at what appears to be eye level, adopts a bird's-eye view angle, looking directly down at the subjects. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring both subjects and their surroundings are sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, continuously rolling clockwise as it captures the scene. The woman appears to be talking animatedly, moving her hands and gesturing towards the young man's chest and shoulder area. The young man reacts by slightly moving his body and showing an awkward expression. The woman continues to gesture and talk, while the young man seems to be physically reacting by shifting away from her gestures before his expression transitions to a more neutral state. The woman looks at the young man and continues to talk, while the young man appears to be responding to her. The lighting appears to be artificial, suggesting an interior setting.",

    "Camera": "The camera, positioned at what appears to be eye level, adopts a bird's-eye view angle, looking directly down at a boy and a woman lying on a coach. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring both subjects and their surroundings are sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, continuously rolling clockwise as it captures the scene.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, wavy blonde hair spread out behind her, wearing a dark green jacket over a white top and red lipstick with matching red nail polish, lies next to a young man with short, neat brown hair. The young man is wearing a light yellow, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt with two small dark circular pins on his left chest. Both are lying on their backs, with the woman on the left and the young man on the right. The woman gestures with her hand near the young man's chest and shoulder area.",
    "Motion": "The woman appears to be talking animatedly, moving her hands and gesturing towards the young man's chest and shoulder area. The young man reacts by slightly moving his body and showing an awkward expression.

The woman looks at the young man and continues to talk, while the young man appears to be responding to her.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, with two individuals lying on a yellow couch. The couch is upholstered in fabric featuring a repeating pattern of black and white roosters with red accents. The wall behind the couch is a dark, muted green. The lighting appears to be artificial, suggesting an interior setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video shows a medium close-up shot of a woman and a young man. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame, and the young man is on the right, both appearing in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
