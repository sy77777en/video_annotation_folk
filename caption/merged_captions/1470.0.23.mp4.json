  "merged_caption": "The video features a static shot focusing on a human head with short, reddish-brown hair and a light skin tone emerging from a blue carpet, positioned slightly left of center. The head has a neutral expression and remains relatively still, with slight movements, gradually turning to the left of the frame while the person continues speaking. Scattered across the floor are numerous wooden sticks and small objects, contributing to a sense of disarray. In the top right corner, a sofa is visible in the background, partially covered with a blue and white patterned blanket, with two magazines resting on it. The top left corner reveals a wooden chest of drawers in the background. A yellow-framed portrait photograph lies on the floor near the human head. The camera maintains a consistent high angle above the subject, capturing the scene without any noticeable change in shot size. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground where the person's head is located. There is a smooth zoom-in movement, enhancing the focus on the subject without any shaking. The setting suggests a home environment, likely a bedroom, with a playful or surreal element.",

A wooden dresser is visible, along with a light beige sofa covered in a blue and white patterned blanket, on which two magazines are placed. A notable element is a human head emerging from the carpet, surrounded by debris, adding an unusual aspect to the scene. The environment is cluttered, with various objects contributing to a sense of disarray. Additionally, a yellow frame containing a portrait photograph is on the floor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
