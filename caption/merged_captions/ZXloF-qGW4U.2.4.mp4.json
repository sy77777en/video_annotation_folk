  "merged_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark hair, a beard, and a mustache is positioned in the center foreground, looking directly forward. Initially, his features are mostly obscured in darkness, with a faint blue light visible on the right side of his face. As the shot progresses, the lighting on his face and the hazy aura around his head gradually intensify, transitioning into a swirling combination of red and deep purple light that fills the space. The man remains stationary, his eyes wide open and mouth slightly agape, as the reddish-purple light emerges and intensifies, surrounding his head and bringing his face into full view while he remains fixed in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The background remains completely obscured in darkness as the vibrant, saturated colors wash over the central figure. The man is illuminated by stylized lighting, with blue light on one side of his face and a reddish-purple light on the other, all set against a dark background. A hazy, colorful aura in shades of red and purple surrounds his head, and reflections in his eyes create the appearance of them glowing. The camera maintains a fixed shot filmed from a level angle, capturing the evolving interplay of light and color that defines the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
