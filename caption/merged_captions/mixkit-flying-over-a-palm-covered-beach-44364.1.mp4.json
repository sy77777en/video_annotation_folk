  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a tropical coastline. The ocean occupies the left side of the frame, with a sandy beach forming a curve between the water and a dense forest of palm trees that extends from the foreground to the background. In the background, hazy, tree-covered hills stretch across the horizon under a pale sky at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a level angle and glides steadily forward, causing the trees in the middle ground to exit the frame from the bottom, continuously revealing more of the coastline and forest ahead. The aerial, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. As the camera flies smoothly forward over the tropical coastline, it pans slightly to the left, enhancing the view of the expansive environment and atmosphere. The scene is filmed by a drone during the early morning or late afternoon, likely at sunrise or sunset, with the low sun illuminating the hazy, pale sky. The calm ocean meets the wide, sandy beach, where gentle waves create lines of white surf. Adjacent to the beach, the dense forest of tall, green palm trees stretches along the shore. Further inland, the landscape rises into rolling hills covered in thick, dark green vegetation. The aerial perspective showcases the gentle waves of the ocean meeting the sandy beach, bordered by the dense forest, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the location rather than a specific object or entity. There are no specific moving subjects in the frame, allowing the focus to remain on the scale of the tropical coastline and the serene, expansive environment.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, capturing the scale of the tropical coastline. The aerial perspective showcases the gentle waves of the ocean meeting a sandy beach, which is bordered by a dense forest of tall, green palm trees. In the distance, hazy, tree-covered hills stretch across the horizon under a pale, early morning or late afternoon sky, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the location rather than a specific object or entity.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a tropical coastline, likely at sunrise or sunset. The camera moves slowly and steadily forward over a dense forest of palm trees, revealing a long, sandy beach and the ocean. There are no specific moving subjects in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone glides forward over a vast tropical coastline during the early morning or late afternoon. On the left, the calm ocean meets a wide, sandy beach that curves into the distance, with gentle waves creating lines of white surf. Adjacent to the beach, a dense forest of tall, green palm trees stretches along the shore. Further inland, the landscape rises into rolling hills covered in thick, dark green vegetation, all under a hazy, pale sky illuminated by the low sun.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
