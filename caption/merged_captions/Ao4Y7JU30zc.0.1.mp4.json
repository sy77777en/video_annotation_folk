  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, the silhouette of a man is positioned, occupying the left-center, center, and right foreground, his profile facing left. A light source from the top-left background illuminates the outline of his head and hands, which are pressed together in front of his mouth. The rest of his form and the background are in deep shadow, with a partially open door visible in the background on the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using an eye-level perspective with a level angle. The focus plane transitions smoothly through a rack focus, moving from an out-of-focus state to sharply defined silhouettes of people in the foreground. While the camera remains mostly steady, there are minor shakes, indicating it is not entirely fixed. The man slowly rubs his hands together and brings them close to his mouth, holding a pose with his head bowed. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are pressed together in a prayer-like gesture in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible. In a dimly lit indoor setting, the silhouette of a person is captured in profile. A soft light source, positioned off-camera to the left, outlines their form, casting their features and the majority of the room into deep shadow. The background is indistinct and out of focus, suggesting the interior of a room.",

The focus plane transitions smoothly through a rack focus, moving from an out-of-focus state to sharply defined silhouettes of people in the foreground. While the camera remains mostly steady, there are minor shakes, indicating it is not entirely fixed.",
    "Subject": "A man is shown in a dark, heavily silhouetted profile shot. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are pressed together in a prayer-like gesture in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible.",
    "Motion": "The man slowly rubs his hands together and brings them close to his mouth, holding a pose with his head bowed.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, the silhouette of a person is captured in profile. A soft light source, positioned off-camera to the left, outlines their form, casting their features and the majority of the room into deep shadow. The person's hands are held together near their mouth. The background is indistinct and out of focus, suggesting the interior of a room.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, the silhouette of a man is positioned, occupying the left-center, center, and right foreground, his profile facing left. A light source from the top-left background illuminates the outline of his head and hands, which are pressed together in front of his mouth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
