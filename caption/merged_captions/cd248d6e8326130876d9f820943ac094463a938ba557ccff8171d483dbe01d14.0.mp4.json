  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' leg level, in slow-motion. Initially, the lower body of a skater (Skater 1), wearing black leggings with white stripes and a dark top, is visible standing in a doorway located on the center-right of the frame, in the middle ground. The white ice surface occupies the foreground and extends into the background, bordered on the right by light-colored rink boards containing the doorway. The camera is fixed at hip level with a level angle, maintaining a shallow depth of field focused on the midground where the ice skaters are. The camera is slightly unsteady but has no intentional movement. A second skater (Skater 2), dressed entirely in black, emerges from this center-right, middle-ground doorway, jumps onto the ice, skates straight across to the left, and exits the frame. Subsequently, a third skater (Skater 3), wearing black tights with a grey jacket, follows a similar path, emerging from the same center-right, middle-ground doorway, jumps onto the ice, skates towards the left, and exits the frame. Finally, a fourth skater (Skater 4), also dressed in all black, exits through the gate and skates leftward in the same direction as the others. All skaters remain within the middle ground throughout the scene, moving from the center-right to the far left, eventually exiting the frame. The scene is set in an indoor ice skating rink, with the camera positioned low, offering a view across the white, reflective ice surface marked with skate lines. In the background, the far wall of the rink displays small, rectangular windows high up, and a transparent barrier is visible above the rink boards. The ceiling reveals a structure of metal trusses and lighting fixtures.",

    "Subject": "The video shows the lower bodies of four individuals on an ice rink, all wearing white figure skates. The first individual, initially positioned in a doorway, wears black leggings with three thin white vertical stripes on each outer leg and a dark blue and black top. A second individual, wearing black leggings and a black long-sleeved top, enters the ice rink from the center gate and skates toward the left across the scene. A third individual, dressed in black leggings without stripes and a light grey top, skates out from the same doorway. The fourth skater, wearing all black, follows. Finally, the first skater moves after the other three, skating leftward further into the rink.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an individual in striped leggings standing in a doorway at the edge of an ice rink. Another individual in a black top jumps out from the gate and begins skating across the ice towards the left. Subsequently, an individual in a grey top jumps onto the ice from the doorway and begins skating leftward. This is followed by an individual in all black, who also jumps onto the ice from the doorway and skates to the left. Finally, the first individual in striped leggings skates leftward.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an indoor ice skating rink, with the camera positioned low, offering a view across the white, reflective ice surface marked with skate lines. To the right, the rink boards are light-colored with a lower yellow band, featuring an ice rink gate from which skaters emerge. In the background, the far wall of the rink displays small, rectangular windows high up, and a transparent barrier is visible above the rink boards. The ceiling reveals a structure of metal trusses and lighting fixtures. Skaters in dark leggings and white ice skates are seen moving on the ice.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
