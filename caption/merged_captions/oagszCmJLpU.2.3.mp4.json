  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from a static, low-angle camera position that appears to be between overhead and eye level. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and the dramatic sky in sharp detail. A massive storm cloud formation dominates most of the frame, situated in the middle ground and extending into the background. Below this, a thin, dark strip of land occupies the bottom of the frame. Throughout the time-lapse, the main cloud mass moves from left to right, moving away from the camera, while flashes of lightning illuminate its interior, contrasting with the deep blue and purple hues of the sky. The sky transitions from blue to deep blue as dusk turns into night, with stars becoming visible in the top-right background. The storm clouds, a large churning mass of dark blue and black, are intermittently illuminated by brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning, revealing their turbulent nature. As the sequence progresses and the sky darkens, faint stars begin to appear in the clearer sections, while the last vestiges of sunset cast a soft pink glow on smaller, peripheral clouds. Along the distant, flat horizon, a few small, bright lights are scattered, suggesting a far-off town or sparse settlement, emphasizing the immense and empty space under the powerful storm. The video captures the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event, focusing on the dramatic interplay of light and shadow within the storm system.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle time-lapse of a storm. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and the dramatic sky in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, flat plain as dusk transitions into night. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. A massive, dark, and turbulent storm cloud dominates the deep blue sky, its interior illuminated by frequent, brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning. As the sequence progresses and the sky darkens, faint stars begin to appear in the clearer sections, while the last vestiges of sunset cast a soft pink glow on smaller, peripheral clouds. Along the distant, dark horizon, a scattering of tiny, bright lights suggests a far-off town or sparse settlement, emphasizing the immense and empty space under the powerful storm.",
    "Motion": "This dramatic scenery shot captures a massive thunderstorm at the time of sunset over a flat, dark landscape. Flashes of lightning illuminate the turbulent, dark clouds from within, contrasting with the deep blue and purple hues of the sky where stars are visible. The video is a time-lapse.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a massive storm system developing at the time of sunset over a flat, dark landscape. The sky gradually becomes a deep, dark blue, with stars visible in the clearer sections. A large, churning mass of dark blue and black clouds dominates the view, with intermittent flashes of lightning illuminating its interior, revealing white and purple hues. The storm clouds move rightward and away from the camera, although the lightning does not have a prominent direction. Along the distant, flat horizon, a few small, bright lights are scattered.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from a static camera position that appears to be between overhead and eye level. A massive storm cloud formation dominates most of the frame, situated in the middle ground and extending into the background. Below this, a thin, dark strip of land occupies the bottom of the frame. Throughout the time-lapse, the main cloud mass moves from left to right, moving away from the camera, while flashes of lightning illuminate its interior. The sky is visible in most portions of the frame and transitions from blue to deep blue, with stars becoming visible in the top-right background. A few small, stationary lights are scattered along the distant horizon in the background at the bottom of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
