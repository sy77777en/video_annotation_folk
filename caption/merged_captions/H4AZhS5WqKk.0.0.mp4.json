  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames the animated cat, Tom, in the left-center of the frame and in the foreground, sitting on a concrete step while holding a black electronic keyboard. Tom, identifiable by his blue-grey fur, light grey-blue chest, white muzzle and paws, and pink inner ears, presses a key on the keyboard. To his right in the middle ground, there is a large cardboard box, with wooden pallets further to the right and black trash bags in the middle ground behind the box. A brick wall, a staircase, and a metal door occupy the background on the left, while the wet, paved ground is visible in the foreground. The right side of the keyboard then breaks off, falling from its position in the foreground to a spot near the cat's left feet, still in the foreground, revealing a cluster of colorful wires. Tom looks down at the broken piece with a dejected expression before his body suddenly jerks and his eyes widen. The setting is a dark, wet alley at night, with the ground composed of dark paving stones reflecting some light due to the wet surface. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot, filmed from a hip-level, level angle, and employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on Tom in the foreground.",

    "Subject": "A 2D animated cat, identifiable as Tom, sits on a step. He has blue-grey fur, a light grey-blue chest, and white muzzle and paws, with pink inner ears. He holds a black electronic keyboard, which is broken, with a cluster of colorful wires exposed after the right part fell to the ground.",
    "Motion": "The animated cat presses a key on the electronic keyboard he is holding. The right side of the keyboard then breaks off and falls to the ground, exposing a cluster of wires. The cat looks down at the broken piece with a dejected expression before his body suddenly jerks and his eyes widen.",
    "Scene": "The setting is a dark, wet alley at night, with a brick wall, a metal door, and a concrete staircase in the background. The ground is composed of dark paving stones, reflecting some light due to the wet surface. A large, open cardboard box sits on a concrete step, with stacked wooden racks to its right and black trash bags behind it. A cartoon cat sits on the step holding a black electronic keyboard, which subsequently breaks apart, causing its right side to drop to the ground and exposing its internal wiring.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
