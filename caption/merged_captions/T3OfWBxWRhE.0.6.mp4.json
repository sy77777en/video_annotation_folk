  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, moving perspective, featuring the Auckland War Memorial Museum, a large, neoclassical building constructed from white stone in a Neoclassical style, appearing light pink due to the camera's capture. The building is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying the middle half of the frame, with a cloudy sky in the background. It features a central portico with tall columns flanked by two wings with rows of windows. In front of the building, a wide staircase and a tall, rectangular stone cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath are also located in the middle ground; the cenotaph is positioned in the center-right of the frame. The museum is situated on a grassy incline, and the ground appears wet. The camera begins by trucking right at a steady pace, then suddenly accelerates while simultaneously trucking right and panning left to keep the building centered in the frame. The camera's movement from a passing vehicle causes the immediate foreground to blur, creating a sense of motion past the grand structure. Due to this motion, the cenotaph appears to shift slightly leftward relative to the stationary building behind it. The low, moving perspective further enhances the sense of scale and monumentality, emphasizing the building's grandeur and its role as a significant landmark rather than any individual element. The absence of a specific main subject allows the focus to rest entirely on the impressive scale and stately atmosphere of the architectural environment.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low, eye-level angle, utilizing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera begins by trucking right at a steady pace, then suddenly accelerates while simultaneously trucking right and panning left to keep the building centered in the frame.",
    "Subject": "This video is an architectural scenery shot capturing a grand, neoclassical building under a vast, cloudy sky. The symmetrical structure, made of light-colored stone, is defined by a central portico with imposing columns and two extensive wings lined with rectangular windows. Positioned in the middle ground is a tall, white cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath, standing before a wide staircase that ascends to the building's entrance. The absence of a specific main subject allows the focus to rest entirely on the impressive scale and stately atmosphere of the architectural environment. The composition emphasizes the building's grandeur and its role as a significant landmark rather than any individual element. The low, moving perspective further enhances the sense of scale and monumentality.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a large, neoclassical building, likely a museum or memorial, with the camera consistently moving to the right while panning to the left. Midway through, there is a noticeable acceleration in the camera's movement. The foreground features a motion blur effect, highlighting the dynamic motion past the static structure.",
    "Scene": "A daytime, moving shot captures the Auckland War Memorial Museum under an overcast sky. The large, symmetrical building, constructed from white stone in a Neoclassical style, appears light pink due to the camera's capture. It features a central portico with tall columns flanked by two wings with rows of windows. The museum is situated on a grassy incline, with a broad staircase ascending to the main entrance. In the plaza before the stairs stands a tall, rectangular stone cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath. The ground appears wet, and the camera's movement from a passing vehicle causes the immediate foreground to blur, creating a sense of motion past the grand structure.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, moving perspective. A large building is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying the middle half of the frame, with a cloudy sky in the background. In front of the building, a wide staircase and a tall cenotaph are also located in the middle ground; the cenotaph is positioned in the center-right of the frame. The camera moves horizontally from left to right, causing a blurred surface in the immediate foreground to sweep across the bottom of the frame. Due to this motion, the cenotaph appears to shift slightly leftward relative to the stationary building behind it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
