  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape with no major subjects. Initially, the frame captures a forest in the middle ground, with a house in the bottom right and autumn-colored trees in the bottom left. A prominent double rainbow arches across the sky, with the main arc stretching from the top left toward the center. The video begins with a view of a double rainbow arching over a forested area with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, some of which have autumn foliage. The aerial camera begins at a level angle and shifts to a high angle, effectively capturing the expansive field, road, and woods below. From an aerial level position, the camera slowly ascends and moves forward, revealing more of the landscape behind the initial treeline. As the camera moves upward, the rainbow remains prominent, and the tops of houses and trees become less visible. Utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field, the drone POV maintains smooth forward motion, performing a crane up midway to reveal the forest from above, ensuring steadiness throughout. As the camera rises, the forest shifts to occupy the foreground and the lower portion of the frame. The final view shows a highway with moving cars stretching horizontally across the middle ground, with fields and distant buildings visible beyond it, all set beneath the expansive double rainbow. The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor setting transitioning from a residential area to a more open landscape. It is set during the day, with a stunning double rainbow arching across the sky, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The sky is overcast, suggesting recent or impending rain, which enhances the visibility of the double rainbow. The overall atmosphere is serene, with natural elements like trees and fields dominating the view.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a speed ramp effect, seamlessly transitioning between fast and regular speed playback. The aerial camera begins at a level angle and shifts to a high angle, effectively capturing the expansive field, road, and woods below. Utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field, the drone POV maintains smooth forward motion, performing a crane up midway to reveal the forest from above, ensuring steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a focus on the natural landscape, highlighting a rainbow and the expansive view of trees and fields, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. In the latter portion, a highway with moving cars and several distant buildings come into view, adding a dynamic element to the serene scenery.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a double rainbow arching over a forested area with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, some of which have autumn foliage. As the camera moves upward, the rainbow remains prominent, and the tops of houses and trees become less visible. The camera continues to ascend, revealing more of the landscape, including a road with moving vehicles and a distant town. The rainbow remains the central focus as the camera reaches a higher altitude, showing a broader view of the surrounding area, including fields and more trees.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor setting transitioning from a residential area to a more open landscape. It is set during the day, with a stunning double rainbow arching across the sky, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The environment features a mix of dense evergreen and deciduous trees, with some displaying autumnal hues of red and orange. In the residential area, houses with sloped roofs are visible, nestled among the trees. As the scene transitions, the landscape opens up to reveal fields and a distant view of a road with vehicles, indicating a rural or suburban area. The sky is overcast, suggesting recent or impending rain, which enhances the visibility of the double rainbow. The overall atmosphere is serene, with natural elements like trees and fields dominating the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
