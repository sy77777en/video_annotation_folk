  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot of an elderly man with light skin and short, gray hair, whose face is centrally positioned in the foreground of the frame. His face is characterized by prominent wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes, and he is wearing a dark green collared shirt. Initially, his head is bowed with his eyes closed, causing his forehead and the upper part of his face to be the most prominent features within this central framing. The camera is at a level angle and uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. In a dimly lit indoor setting, the background is out of focus and appears to be a plain wall, suggesting a simple interior. In the bottom-left corner, there is a dark-colored cabinet that is mostly obscured by the man's body, with some parts of it being out of focus. The lighting is warm and soft, casting subtle shadows on the man's features, and the overall color palette is muted, dominated by earthy tones. The elderly man then slowly lifts his head a small amount, opening his eyes, which are light-colored. This movement brings his eyes and more of his lower face into direct view as his gaze shifts from looking slightly upwards to a forward direction, while his face remains the central element in the foreground. He subtly turns his head to his left before shifting his gaze to a direct, focused look.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
