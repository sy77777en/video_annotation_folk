  "merged_caption": "The video captures a full shot of the scene, featuring a large passenger airplane in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground and extending into the middle ground. The airplane, with its distinctive silver-white color and a prominent dark emblem on the tail resembling a bird, dominates most of the frame. Centrally positioned and slightly to the left, the damaged hangar is visible, with its collapsed roof and walls. Debris from the collision is scattered across the middle ground on the left, while smoke is the only motion in the scene, billowing from the damaged area, adding depth to the scene. The wet tarmac, reflecting bright lights, spans the entire bottom of the frame, enhancing the visual impact. Various airport vehicles and equipment are visible in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The camera features an aerial-level view at a high angle, looking down on the airplane crash scene. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene, and smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the airplane, providing a dynamic view of the spatial arrangement and the extent of the damage with minimal shaking. The scene is set in an outdoor airport environment at night, illuminated by artificial lights, casting reflections on the wet tarmac, suggesting recent rain. The structure is illuminated by bright lights, highlighting the extent of the destruction. Surrounding the scene are various airport vehicles and equipment, contributing to the industrial environment. The area is illuminated by artificial lights, casting reflections on the wet tarmac, suggesting recent rain. The scene is set on a wet tarmac, reflecting the lights and adding to the dramatic visual impact.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down on an airplane crash scene. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. It smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the airplane, providing a comprehensive view of the crash site with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a distinctive tail design, which has collided with a building. The aircraft is silver and white, with a prominent dark emblem on the tail that resembles a bird. The building, which appears to be a hangar, is partially collapsed, with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke is rising from the damaged area, and the structure is illuminated by bright lights, highlighting the extent of the destruction. The scene is set on a wet tarmac, reflecting the lights and adding to the dramatic visual impact.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a large airplane with a distinctive tail design that has crashed into a building, coming to a complete stop with no movement visible. Smoke is the only motion in the scene, billowing from the damaged area, while the building's roof is partially collapsed, indicating a severe structural failure. The tarmac is wet, reflecting the lights from the scene, and the surrounding area appears to be an airport or airfield.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor airport setting at night. The scene features a large aircraft that has collided with a hangar, causing significant structural damage. The hangar's roof and walls are partially collapsed, with debris scattered around. The aircraft is light-colored with a distinctive emblem on its tail. The area is illuminated by artificial lights, casting reflections on the wet tarmac, suggesting recent rain. Smoke or mist rises from the damaged hangar, adding to the dramatic atmosphere. Surrounding the scene are various airport vehicles and equipment, contributing to the industrial environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
