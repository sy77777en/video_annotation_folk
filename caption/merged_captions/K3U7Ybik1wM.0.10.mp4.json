  "merged_caption": "From a bird's-eye perspective, a pair of light-skinned, bare feet and the lower portion of loose-fitting blue pants are positioned in the bottom center foreground. The person walks forward on a brown, textured carpet that fills the entire frame in a dimly lit indoor setting. A warm, orange-hued light source illuminates the center and lower right side, casting a large, dark shadow of the person from the bottom of the frame, extending into the center and left middle ground. As the person moves, the entire frame glides forward, with the feet taking alternating steps at the bottom of the screen, while the camera maintains its top-down angle. The slightly unsteady camera simulates the person's gait, moving steadily ahead. A deep focus keeps both the feet and the floor in sharp detail, enhancing the first-person point of view as if through the character’s eyes.",

    "Camera": "From a first-person, bird's-eye perspective, the camera looks down at a pair of bare feet walking on a carpet. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward, simulating the person's gait. A deep focus keeps both the feet and the floor in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person point of view, a person with light-skinned, bare feet is seen walking forward. They are wearing loose-fitting, blue pants that cover their legs down to the ankles. The person is walking on a brown, textured carpet in a dimly lit environment, with a warm light source casting a large, dark shadow of their legs and body onto the floor in front of them.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person walks forward across a brown carpet in a dimly lit room. Their bare feet are visible as they take successive steps, moving steadily ahead.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down at a pair of bare feet walking across a carpeted floor. The indoor setting is dimly lit by a warm, orange-hued light source, which casts a large, dark shadow of the person onto the beige, short-pile carpet. The individual is wearing loose-fitting blue pants as they take slow steps forward.",
    "Spatial": "From a bird's-eye perspective, a pair of bare feet and the lower portion of blue pants are positioned in the bottom center foreground. A large, dark shadow of the person is cast from the bottom of the frame, extending into the center and left middle ground. The subject walks forward on a brown carpet that fills the entire frame, with a warm light source illuminating the center and lower right side. As the person moves, the entire frame glides forward, with the feet taking alternating steps at the bottom of the screen, while the camera maintains its top-down angle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
