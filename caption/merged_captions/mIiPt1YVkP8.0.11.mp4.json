  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a large white commercial airplane is positioned in the foreground, centered in the top half of the frame. The camera tracks the airplane from a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field for clarity throughout the scene. Initially positioned below and behind the airplane, the camera moves forward with a slight upward trajectory, incorporating rolling motions for a dynamic feel while maintaining a consistent angle. As the airplane descends towards the runway, the camera follows smoothly, with minimal shaking, transitioning to be at the subject's level. This movement makes the runway in the middle ground appear to rise toward the descending plane in the foreground. The airplane's wings are extended horizontally, with engines visible beneath them, and its tail fin prominently displayed. Below the aircraft, an illuminated airport runway is situated in the center of the middle ground, marked by bright lights that contrast with the surrounding darkness, highlighting its path. To the left of the runway, small, lit structures resembling airport buildings are visible, characterized by their structured layout and subtle lighting, providing context against the dark background. The entire scene is set against a dark background, emphasizing the airplane and runway lights. The video captures the precision and control involved in landing, showcasing the motion of the aircraft as it nears the ground. As the airplane is tracked, it becomes larger in the frame, enhancing the focus on the plane's descent. The scene captures the structured environment of the airport at night, with the airplane's sleek, aerodynamic shape clearly defined against the night sky.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera tracking an airplane from a level angle, aerial level perspective, moving forward with a slight upward trajectory. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene. It incorporates rolling motions, creating a dynamic feel, while maintaining a consistent angle. The movement is smooth, with minimal shaking, and as the airplane is tracked, it becomes larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large, white commercial airplane viewed from behind, flying towards a runway. The aircraft's wings are extended horizontally, and its engines are visible under the wings. The plane is centered in the frame, with its tail fin prominently displayed. Below the aircraft, the runway is illuminated with lights that guide the plane's approach. To the left, there are structures resembling airport buildings, which are lit and appear small in comparison to the plane. The scene is set against a dark background, emphasizing the airplane and runway lights.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a large, white commercial airplane from behind as it makes a gradual approach towards the runway, showcasing the precision and control involved in landing. The aircraft's wings are extended horizontally, with engines visible beneath them, and its tail fin prominently displayed. The runway below is illuminated with guiding lights, enhancing the focus on the plane's descent. To the left, small, lit structures resembling airport buildings provide context against the dark background, emphasizing the airplane and runway lights.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor nighttime scene featuring an airplane approaching a runway. The setting is an airport, with the aircraft centrally positioned, viewed from behind as it descends towards the illuminated landing strip. The runway is marked by bright lights that contrast with the surrounding darkness, highlighting its path. To the left of the runway, airport buildings are visible, characterized by their structured layout and subtle lighting. The airplane is white, with a sleek, aerodynamic shape, and its engines and tail are clearly defined against the night sky. The scene captures the motion of the aircraft as it nears the ground, emphasizing the structured environment of the airport at night.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a large white airplane is positioned in the foreground, centered in the top half of the frame. Below the aircraft, an illuminated airport runway is situated in the center of the middle ground, with lit airport buildings visible to the left. The entire scene is set against a dark background. The camera is initially positioned below and behind the airplane. As the airplane descends towards the runway, the camera follows, maintaining its position relative to the aircraft and transitioning to be at the subject's level. This movement makes the runway in the middle ground appear to rise toward the descending plane in the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
