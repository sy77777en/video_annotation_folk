  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning the main football player, a man with a dark skin tone in a yellow jersey with black shoulders and the white number \"86\" on the front, in the left foreground as he runs with a brown football toward the right side of the frame. He wears black pants with a white stripe down the side and a black helmet. In the bottom foreground, two other players are tangled on the ground: a teammate in a similar yellow and black uniform and an opposing player in a light blue and white uniform. Other players from both teams are scattered across the middle ground, running in various states of motion, with a large crowd of spectators, many wearing yellow, filling the background in the outdoor football stadium. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, tracks the main player's run, smoothly transitioning into a full shot. The camera trucks to the right, first panning slightly right and then left to keep the player in frame, with the movement slightly unsteady and some shaking. As the main player runs past, an opposing player dives onto the ground in the foreground. The main player predominantly remains on the center-left of the frame throughout the video but concludes positioned in the center of the frame. A deep focus keeps both the player and the background crowd relatively sharp, capturing the dynamic action of the football game in progress on the green grass field marked with white yard lines.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot tracks a football player from the side as he runs with the ball. The camera trucks to the right, first panning slightly right and then left to keep the player in frame. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and a deep focus keeps both the player and the background crowd relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a football player, a man with a dark skin tone, running across a green field while holding a brown football. He wears a yellow jersey with black shoulders and the white number \"86\" on the front, along with black pants that have a white stripe down the side and a black helmet. On the ground, another player in a similar yellow and black uniform is tangled with an opposing player in a light blue and white uniform. Other players from both teams are visible in the background, also running on the field. A large crowd of spectators, many wearing yellow, can be seen in the stands.",
    "Motion": "A football player in a yellow jersey runs with the ball across the field toward the right. He passes a teammate on the ground who has just tackled an opposing player in a light blue uniform. Other players from both teams run in the background, some chasing the ball carrier.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor football stadium is filled with a large crowd of spectators, many of whom are wearing yellow, creating a dense, colorful backdrop in the stands. On the green grass field, marked with white yard lines, a football game is in progress. A player in a yellow and black uniform with the number 86 on his jersey runs with the ball. An opposing player in a light blue and white uniform is nearby. The point of view is slightly shaky, suggesting that a camera operator might be running on the field. Other players from both teams are scattered across the field in various states of motion.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning the main football player in a yellow jersey in the left foreground as he runs toward the right side of the frame. In the bottom foreground, two other players are tangled on the ground, with more players scattered across the middle ground and a large crowd filling the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, tracks the main player's run, smoothly transitioning into a full shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
