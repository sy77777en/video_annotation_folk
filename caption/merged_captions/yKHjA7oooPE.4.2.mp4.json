  "merged_caption": "On the right side, a large, pink, intricately textured organic mass resembling a brain rests on a dark green base with spiky protrusions. To its left, in the center, is a dark green, spiky oval structure with a brightly glowing, yellow-green center. Further to the left, a dark red, irregularly shaped opening is visible, characterized by several yellowish-white, fang-like protrusions pointing inwards. A small, black, silhouetted creature with pointed ears and a tail, akin to a cat or demon, is expelled from this red opening, moving towards the right. Simultaneously, three human-like figures, dressed in dark jackets and pants, are also ejected from the red opening; they move upwards and to the right, tumbling into the glowing center of the dark green oval. One of these figures has a white pentagram symbol on their back. The cat-like creature continues to move and crawl in the area to the right of the green oval. The scene is set within a vibrant and abstract, otherworldly environment, rendered in a palette of intense pinks, purples, greens, and reds, with neon-like outlines. The background is filled with smaller, floating organic shapes and crisscrossing thin, glowing lines of yellow, pink, and blue. The camera is static, capturing the dynamic motion of the figures and creature within this surreal landscape.",

    "Subject": "A large, pink, intricately textured organic mass, resembling a brain or fleshy growth, rests upon a dark green base with spiky protrusions. To its left is a prominent, dark green, oval-shaped object featuring purple spikes around its perimeter and a brightly glowing, yellow-green center. Further left, a dark red, irregularly shaped opening is visible, characterized by several yellowish-white, fang-like protrusions pointing inwards. A small, black, silhouetted creature with pointed ears and a tail, akin to a cat or demon, is expelled from the red opening simultaneously with three human-like figures, dressed in dark jackets and pants, who appear to be falling or tumbling; one of these figures has a white pentagram symbol on their back. While the human-like figures are thrown into the dark green oval, the cat-like demon continues to move and crawl outside, remaining near the opening.",
    "Motion": "A black, silhouetted creature and three human-like figures are simultaneously expelled from a dark red, irregularly shaped opening. The three human-like figures tumble towards and into a dark green, oval-shaped object. The cat-like creature, after being expelled, moves and crawls near the red opening.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a vibrant and abstract, otherworldly environment, rendered in a palette of intense pinks, purples, greens, and reds, with neon-like outlines. Large, organic, and unusual forms populate this space. Prominently, a substantial, brain-like, pinkish-red mass sits on a dark green base from which dark tendrils extend downwards. Nearby, a large, spiky, dark green and purple oval structure features a bright, yellow-green, glowing center. To the left, a reddish, irregularly shaped opening is visible, distinguished by yellowish-white, tooth-like protrusions along its inner edge. The background is filled with smaller, floating organic shapes and crisscrossing thin, glowing lines of yellow, pink, and blue. A small, black, cat-like silhouette navigates this landscape, moving away from the reddish opening, while other indistinct figures are briefly observed tumbling or being drawn towards the spiky oval structure.",
    "Spatial": "On the right side, a large, pink, brain-like mass is positioned on a dark green base. To its left, in the center, is a dark green, spiky oval structure with a brightly glowing, yellow-green center. Further to the left, a dark red, irregularly shaped opening is visible. A small, black, cat-like creature is expelled from this red opening, moving towards the right. Simultaneously, three human-like figures are also ejected from the red opening; they move upwards and to the right, tumbling into the glowing center of the dark green oval. The cat-like creature continues to move in the area to the right of the green oval. The background consists of smaller, abstract organic shapes and glowing lines."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
