  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a large, dark, and heavily rusted submarine lies wrecked and partially buried in a vast landscape of white sand dunes, positioned slightly left of the center and angled diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right. A makeshift settlement is built around the submarine's midsection, consisting of small, white-painted shacks, wooden platforms, and scaffolding, also in the middle ground. To the right of the settlement, several old, rugged vehicles, including a green truck and what appears to be a mobile launcher, are parked. Numerous small, skeletal wind turbines with lattice towers and anemometers are scattered across the scene, some spinning; they are in the middle ground to the left and right of the submarine, with one positioned in the bottom right middle ground. A large shadow moves from left to right in the middle of the video, extending from the left middle ground toward the right. The entire scene is set on vast white sand dunes that extend from the foreground to the background, where a range of rocky mountains is visible across the top of the frame, adding depth to the setting. The camera is positioned high above the subjects, providing an aerial perspective, and features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera moves smoothly and slowly, moving backward and upward, capturing the scene without any shaking. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and desolation, with the sun casting sharp shadows across the sand under a clear blue sky, emphasizing the arid environment devoid of vegetation.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera moves smoothly and slowly, moving backward and upward, capturing the scene without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "In a vast landscape of white sand dunes, a large, dark, and heavily rusted submarine lies wrecked and partially buried. Its hull is broken in several places, and a makeshift settlement is built around its midsection, consisting of small, white-painted shacks, wooden platforms, and scaffolding. Several old, rugged vehicles, including a green truck and what appears to be a mobile launcher, are parked near the settlement. Numerous small, skeletal wind turbines with lattice towers are scattered across the dunes, some standing on their own and others mounted on wheeled bases.",
    "Motion": "The scene features a wrecked submarine, a surrounding settlement, and parked vehicles, with wind turbines and anemometers spinning across the sand dunes. A large shadow moves from left to right in the middle of the video.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a vast desert landscape with rolling sand dunes under a clear blue sky. In the center, a large, weathered submarine is partially buried in the sand, surrounded by a cluster of makeshift structures and equipment. These structures are composed of various materials, including metal and wood, and are scattered around the submarine, suggesting a settlement or outpost. The scene is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the arid environment. In the background, a range of rocky mountains adds depth to the setting. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and desolation, with the sun casting sharp shadows across the sand.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a large, wrecked submarine is positioned slightly left of the center, occupying the middle ground and angled diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right.

Numerous wind turbines and anemometers are scattered across the scene, some spinning; they are in the middle ground to the left and right of the submarine, with one positioned in the bottom right middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
