  "merged_caption": "The video illustrates a hypothetical terraforming process of Mars, featuring two celestial bodies: Mars and a small, asteroid-like gray object. Initially, Mars, a reddish-brown planet, is centered in the frame against a starry backdrop. The gray object appears in the foreground on the lower left, moving out of the frame as the video progresses. The camera, set in outer space, smoothly approaches Mars, which is initially covered in dirt. As the video progresses, Mars undergoes a transformation, rotating from left to right. Its surface gradually changes from reddish-brown to reveal vibrant blue and green areas, indicating the formation of Earth-like features. Detailed features such as continents and oceans become visible, and the transformation culminates in a fully terraformed planet with visible cloud formations and a vibrant blue and green surface. A counterclockwise rotating halo is visible in the upper right corner, adding dynamic visual interest. The setting is the vast, dark expanse of space, dotted with distant stars, providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets. The video effectively captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective.",

    "Camera": "The video features a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, set in outer space, smoothly approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, which transforms into an Earth-like appearance. The camera movement is slow and steady.",
    "Subject": "The video explores the hypothetical terraforming process of Mars. It begins with a focus on two celestial bodies: Mars, a reddish-brown planet with a textured surface marked by craters and dark patches, and a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid. As the video progresses, it illustrates Mars gradually transforming into a vibrant blue and green planet, complete with swirling white cloud formations, symbolizing the successful terraforming of Mars into an Earth-like environment.",
    "Motion": "The video illustrates the hypothetical terraforming process of Mars. It begins with a view of Mars, a reddish-brown planet, alongside a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid. This object moves away from Mars, exiting the frame towards the lower left corner. As the video progresses, Mars undergoes a transformation, rotating from left to right. Its surface gradually changes from reddish-brown to reveal vibrant blue and green areas, indicating the formation of Earth-like features. Detailed features such as continents and oceans become visible, and the transformation culminates in a fully terraformed planet with visible cloud formations and a vibrant blue and green surface.",
    "Scene": "The video offers a captivating view of outer space, focusing on a hypothetical terraforming process of Mars. It primarily features two celestial bodies: Mars and a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid. Initially, Mars is depicted with its reddish-brown surface, marked by craters and canyons. The video illustrates Mars gradually transforming into a vibrant blue and green planet, showcasing its potential future. The setting is the vast, dark expanse of space, dotted with distant stars, providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets. The video effectively captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective.",
    "Spatial": "The video illustrates a hypothetical terraforming process of Mars, featuring two celestial bodies: Mars and a small, asteroid-like gray object. Initially, Mars, a reddish-brown planet, is centered in the frame against a starry backdrop. The gray object appears in the foreground on the lower left, moving out of the frame as the video progresses. Mars gradually transforms into a vibrant blue and green planet, maintaining its central position. A counterclockwise rotating halo is visible in the upper right corner, adding dynamic visual interest. The transformation highlights the change in Mars' appearance, with detailed surface features becoming more apparent as the gray object exits the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
