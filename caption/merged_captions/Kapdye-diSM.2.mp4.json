  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a red, two-door Land Rover Defender with a white roof is positioned in the middle ground center, next to a large stone building that occupies the left side of the frame. The vehicle is outfitted with a black roof rack carrying a grey, covered, rectangular item, likely a rooftop tent, and several round spotlights are mounted on the front of the rack. A black snorkel runs up the A-pillar on the vehicle's right side, and a black-covered spare tire is mounted on the hood. The lower section of the vehicle's body is silver, and it is fitted with white wheels and thick, off-road tires. The street fills the bottom half of the frame, while other parked cars, including a white van, a white sedan, and a gray car, and buildings are visible in the middle ground and background on the right. An overlay element in the bottom right corner reads 'STRADMAN' in red, with a smaller white 'the' positioned above the letter 'M'. From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera moves forward, pans right, and then shifts left to center on the red Land Rover Defender parked diagonally in a roadside parking spot, prominently centered in the frame. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the vehicle and the background architecture sharp. The scene is set on an overcast day on a city street lined with large, classical buildings made of light-colored stone. In the further middle ground and background, black flags hang from the buildings opposite. The perspective moves slowly forward, panning along the side of the vehicle, capturing the dynamic environment and the unique features of the Land Rover Defender.",

    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set on an overcast day on a city street lined with large, classical buildings made of light-colored stone. A red, two-door Land Rover with a white roof is parked diagonally in a marked bay on the asphalt. The vehicle is outfitted with a black roof rack carrying a covered load, additional spotlights, and a snorkel. The perspective moves slowly forward, panning along the side of the vehicle. In the further middle ground and background, other cars are parked along the street, and black flags hang from the buildings opposite. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"the STRADMAN\" in red and black.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
