  "merged_caption": "This 2D video captures a static camera shot with slight unsteadiness, showcasing a hand-drawn animated scene featuring a silhouetted woman in a black-and-white style. Initially, a dark, textured slope occupies the bottom of the frame, rising from the bottom right to the higher bottom left. The woman appears on the left, walking down the slope toward the right while pulling a small suitcase. As she moves, a textured blue area expands from her back, moving rightward to fill the background. Simultaneously, the portion of the dark slope transforms into a green, grassy hill, a change that also progresses from left to right. The words \"CAPABLE of LOVE\" appear in the top center in a simple black font. As the blue area sweeps across them, the font transforms into a green, vine-like style from left to right. Shortly after the font fully transforms, the text disappears completely. Small, red, star-shaped flowers sprout on the newly green ground, followed by the upward growth of larger purple flowers with yellow centers and green stems across the slope. The part to the left of the woman transforms into a colorful, crayon-like drawing, enhancing the vibrant scene.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a hand-drawn animated scene featuring a silhouetted woman in a black-and-white style. She is initially seen walking down a dark, barren slope while pulling a small suitcase. A large, textured, light-blue area is present from the beginning and gradually extends as the scene transforms. As the woman walks, the ground becomes a green, grassy hill. The words \"CAPABLE of LOVE\" appear in a simple black font and gradually change to a green, vine-like font as the blue area sweeps across them. Small, red, star-shaped flowers sprout all over the hill within the green-colored ground area, followed by the growth of larger purple flowers with yellow centers and green stems across the slope.",
    "Motion": "A woman in a black-and-white style walks down a dark, sloping hill while pulling a suitcase. As she proceeds, a hand-drawn, light-blue area expands from the left, transforming the dark ground into a green, grassy hill. The text \"CAPABLE of LOVE\" appears, with the word \"CAPABLE\" gradually transforming into a green, vine-like font as the light-blue area moves across it. The words disappear shortly after turning completely green. Small, red, star-shaped flowers then sprout on the newly green ground, followed by the upward growth of larger purple flowers across the slope.",
    "Scene": "This animated video presents a stylized outdoor scene. Initially, a black-and-white stylized woman pulling a suitcase walks down a dark, textured hill against a stark white background. The part to the left of the woman transforms into a colorful, crayon-like drawing. A textured blue area gradually extends from behind the woman to cover the front of her, filling the background, and the corresponding section of the hill turns a vibrant green, sprouting red, star-shaped flowers and larger purple blossoms. Text appears across the top center, with \"CAPABLE\" and \"of LOVE\" initially in a simple black font. As the blue area sweeps across them, the words change to a green, vine-like font. Finally, the words all disappear after they become completely green.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
