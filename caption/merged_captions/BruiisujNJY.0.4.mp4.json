  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide shot focused on two distinct textures under dim, warm lighting. Initially, the frame is split, with a light tan, grid-patterned surface with dark specks occupying the foreground on the left. To its right and in the background is a darker, reddish-brown surface featuring a horizontal row of dark, circular indentations aligned along a vertical seam. The overall color palette is monochromatic, consisting of shades of brown. The camera, with a slightly unsteady motion, moves forward, pans left, and then moves to the right, framed from a level angle and utilizing a deep focus, resulting in a large depth of field where most of the scene is in focus. As the shot progresses, the tan surface on the left moves horizontally out of the frame from the left, causing the reddish-brown surface to shift left and eventually fill the entire view. The reddish-brown material extends behind the sandy-colored surface, and as the video progresses, the sandy-colored surface on the left gradually moves out of the frame, allowing the reddish-brown material to occupy the entire frame. The dim, warm lighting enhances the tactile nature of the scene, drawing attention to the textures themselves rather than a specific object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an abstract, wide scenery shot that emphasizes texture and form over a discernible subject. The composition is split between two contrasting surfaces, with the focus placed on the environment's material qualities to create a mysterious atmosphere. On the left, a rough, sandy-colored surface is marked by a faint grid pattern and dark specks. Juxtaposed against it on the right is a dark, reddish-brown material with a leathery or wooden texture, distinguished by a horizontal row of dark, circular indentations. The reddish-brown material extends behind the sandy-colored surface. As the video progresses, the sandy-colored surface on the left gradually moves out of the frame, allowing the reddish-brown material to occupy the entire frame. The dim, warm lighting enhances the tactile nature of the scene, drawing attention to the textures themselves rather than a specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a wide shot of two contrasting surfaces. On the left is a light brown, textured surface, and on the right is a dark, reddish-brown surface with a row of circular indentations. The camera moves unsteadily forward and to the right while slightly panning to the left, eventually causing the light brown surface to go out of frame and allowing the reddish-brown surface to occupy the entire frame.",
    "Scene": "A wide shot reveals two contrasting textures under dim, warm lighting. On the left, a light tan surface with a faint grid-like texture and dark specks has an irregular edge. To its right and behind is a darker, reddish-brown surface with a vertical seam. A horizontal row of dark, circular indentations is aligned along this seam. The overall color palette is monochromatic, consisting of shades of brown.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a wide shot focused on two distinct textures. Initially, the frame is split, with a light tan, grid-patterned surface occupying the foreground on the left. To its right and in the background is a dark, reddish-brown surface featuring a horizontal row of circular indentations. As the shot progresses, the tan surface on the left moves horizontally out of the frame from the left, causing the reddish-brown surface to shift left and eventually fill the entire view. The camera moves forward and rightward while panning slightly left throughout this transition."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
