  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a river landscape. A wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white rapids occupies the bottom half of the frame, running from the middle ground toward the foreground. It is flanked by expansive, pebbly banks in the foreground and middle ground on both the left and right sides. The camera is positioned at a slightly elevated height above eye level, capturing the scene from a fixed, straight-on perspective. The camera remains fixed with a stable angle, employing a deep focus that keeps the entire scene, from the rocky riverbanks in the foreground to the distant mountains, sharp and clear. A line of lush green trees extends across the middle ground, situated behind the riverbanks. In the background, rolling green hills covered in dense green trees line the horizon, with more distant, hazy mountains visible behind them. One of the hills on the right has a large, exposed section of light-colored earth. The top half of the frame is filled with a bright blue sky and large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. The composition is intended to capture the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment, focusing on the interplay between the powerful river and the serene mountain landscape rather than a specific object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white rapids. The river is bordered by expansive, grey, pebbly banks. In the background, a line of lush green trees and vegetation gives way to rolling green hills and distant mountains, all set against a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the composition is intended to capture the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment, focusing on the interplay between the powerful river and the serene mountain landscape rather than a specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is a static, wide shot of a scenic river landscape. A wide, blue river with a noticeable current flows through the center of the frame, its banks broad and covered in gray stones and pebbles. In the background, lush green hills and mountains rise against a bright blue sky filled with large, white, puffy clouds.",
    "Scene": "A wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white ripples runs through a valley on a clear day. The river is bordered by broad, gray, rocky shores covered in stones and pebbles. In the background, rolling hills covered in dense green trees line the horizon under a bright blue sky with scattered, white cumulus clouds. One of the hills on the right has a large, exposed section of light-colored earth. More distant, hazy mountains are visible behind the hills.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
