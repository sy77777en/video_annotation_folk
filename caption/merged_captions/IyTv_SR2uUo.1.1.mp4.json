  "merged_caption": "From a rear-facing perspective mounted on a motorcycle, the rider's lower back is positioned on the left side of the frame, with the tail of their bike occupying the bottom left foreground. The camera, mounted on the motorcycle’s tail, provides a slightly unsteady, high-angle, ground-level perspective, following the rider from behind as they race forward. The camera rolls with the bike, creating a varying Dutch angle, while also trucking left simultaneously. At the start, the front wheel of another motorcycle is visible in the top right middle ground before it quickly moves out of the frame to the right. A second motorcycle is located in the middle ground to the right of the main rider, and a third is further back in the middle ground, also on the right. As the camera's vehicle advances, it overtakes the second motorcycle, which exits at the top. The third motorcycle remains in the middle ground on the right. Additionally, there is a fourth motorcycle further to the right than the second one, which can be partially seen in the first part of the video. The rider's shadow is cast onto the track in the right foreground and middle ground, moving along with the camera. The paved track fills the right and central portions of the frame, receding into the background where the sky is visible at the top. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The scene unfolds during a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds, capturing a race from a slightly higher angle on a paved track. The rider in blue, white, and black leathers with the word \"MEGLIO\" in white text is seen overtaking another racer on a red and orange motorcycle to its right, which moves out of the top right of the frame. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "From a rear-facing perspective on a motorcycle, a racer is seen in a crouched position. This person is wearing a blue, white, and black leather racing suit with the word \"MEGLIO\" in white lettering with a black outline across the lower back. A portion of the motorcycle's white tail section, featuring a black stylized \"io\" logo, is visible on the left. Alongside and slightly ahead, another racer on a red, orange, and white motorcycle is wearing a red, orange, and white suit, who later exits the frame from the top right as the camera passes them. Further in the distance, a third racer in a red and white suit rides a similar red and white motorcycle. At the very beginning, the front wheel and part of the front fairing of a red and white motorcycle are also visible.",
    "Motion": "From a rear-facing perspective, a motorcycle moves forward along a racetrack, overtaking another racer on a red and orange motorcycle to its right. As the camera's motorcycle continues ahead, the passed racer moves out of the top right of the frame. In the distance, other motorcycles also travel along the track.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to the rear of a motorcycle, captures a race from a slightly higher angle on a paved track. During a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds, the camera looks forward over the back of a rider in blue, white, and black leathers that have the word \"MEGLIO\" in white text. The dark shadow of the rider and their vehicle is cast onto the gray asphalt. Other racers on motorcycles, including one in red and white, are in close proximity, maneuvering on the track to the side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
