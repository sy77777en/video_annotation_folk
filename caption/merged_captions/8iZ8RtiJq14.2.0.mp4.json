  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a corkboard, which serves as the background. Initially, a light blue sticky note with the text \"UNCLE JERRY\" is positioned in the center-bottom of the frame. Directly above it, in the center, a red thumbtack holds multiple red strings that radiate outwards across the frame. The camera smoothly and gradually approaches the sticker on the corkboard with a slight clockwise roll, using a deep focus to keep the entire board sharp. A red sticky note, displaying the text \"JEROME JACOBSON,\" then slides into the frame from the bottom-right. It moves through the strings and appears beneath them, settling in the right-center bottom of the frame, to the right of the blue note. The scene is set indoors, featuring a corkboard with a textured, mottled surface. The lighting is brighter in the center, highlighting the board's details and the vibrant color of the strings. The strings connect the papers, suggesting a network or connection between them. At the end of the video, the camera movement becomes progressively slower. There is an overlay in the bottom left that says \"[4,5].\"",

    "Camera": "Due to the close-up nature of the shot, the camera's angle is unclear. The camera smoothly and gradually approaches the sticker on the corkboard with a slight clockwise roll. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire board sharp. At the end of the video, the camera movement becomes progressively slower.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up of a brown, textured corkboard. Several red strings radiate from a central point on the board, held in place by a red, round-headed thumbtack. Pinned beneath the thumbtack is a small, square, light blue sticky note with the words \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in black, block capital letters. Subsequently, another small, square, red sticky note appears to the right of the light blue note, passes through the strings, and appears beneath them. This red note displays the text \"JEROME JACOBSON\" in black, block capital letters.",
    "Motion": "A red sticky note enters the frame from the bottom right, passing through the red strings pinned to a corkboard, and settles beneath them to the right of a light blue sticky note.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, featuring a corkboard with a textured, mottled surface. Red strings are pinned to the board, radiating from a central red pin. Two pieces of paper are attached to the board: one is light blue with \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in bold letters, and the other is red with \"JEROME JACOBSON\" inscribed. The strings connect these papers, suggesting a network or connection between them. In the second part of the video, the red sticky note passes through the strings and appears beneath them. The lighting is brighter in the center, highlighting the board's details and the vibrant color of the strings. There is an overlay in the bottom left that says \"[4,5].\"",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a corkboard, which serves as the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
