  "merged_caption": "A young, light-skinned man with brownish-blonde hair styled back from his forehead is consistently positioned in the center of the frame, wearing a dark, collared coat over a white collared shirt. The scene unfolds outdoors at dusk or dawn, characterized by dim, cool-toned lighting with a prominent teal cast. Initially, the man is seen in profile facing left against a dark, out-of-focus background. The camera, maintaining a smooth, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, moves in a counterclockwise arc around him, keeping the man in focus while the background remains blurred. As the camera moves, blurry yellow buses appear in the background, parked near some trees. The man stands still with his eyes closed as the camera continues its arc, revealing him from the back. Eventually, the camera returns to a profile view, and as it completes its movement, the man opens his eyes and looks ahead, facing directly toward the camera with a calm expression. In the final shot, the background includes a blurry view of trees and a building, with the camera remaining at the man's level throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot that arcs counterclockwise around a man. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in focus while the background is blurred.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with brownish-blonde hair styled back from his forehead is shown in a series of close-up shots. He has a faint mustache and is wearing a dark, collared coat over a white collared shirt. The video captures him from various angles, including in profile with his eyes closed, from the back, and eventually turning to face forward with a calm expression.",
    "Motion": "A man stands still in profile with his eyes closed as the camera moves in a counterclockwise direction around him. As the camera completes its movement, he opens his eyes and looks ahead.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds at dusk or dawn, characterized by dim, cool-toned lighting with a prominent teal cast. In the out-of-focus background, several stationary, yellowish buses are parked near some trees. The shallow depth of field keeps the foreground clear, where a man in a dark coat stands.",
    "Spatial": "A man is consistently positioned in the center of the frame, with the camera moving in a counterclockwise arc around him. Initially, he is seen in profile facing left against a dark, out-of-focus background. As the camera moves, blurry yellow buses appear in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
