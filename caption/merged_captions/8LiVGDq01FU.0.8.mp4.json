  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot frames a person wearing a space helmet on the right side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The individual has light skin and appears focused, looking intently out of a window. The helmet is predominantly dark with lighter accents, featuring a clear visor that reveals their face. On the left, a bookshelf spans the entire frame, extending from the foreground to the background, with some book spines visible in the foreground on the far left. The setting suggests an enclosed space, possibly a spacecraft or similar environment. The lighting is dim, casting shadows and highlighting reflections on the helmet's visor, emphasizing the contours of their face and helmet. The person, shown in profile looking towards the left, slightly tilts their head upwards, with their mouth visibly moving, suggesting that they are speaking. The camera, positioned at eye level, starts with a level angle that shifts to a low angle as the astronaut looks upward, then returns to level when the astronaut lowers their head. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the astronaut in the midground. It remains mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness, tilting up and down to follow the astronaut's head movements. The background consists of bookshelves filled with books, indicating an indoor environment, possibly a library or study area. The lighting is low, casting shadows and enhancing the focus on their expression and the details of the helmet. The person slightly tilts their head upwards before returning to the initial side view, and the camera maintains a position level with the subject throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level, starting with a level angle that shifts to a low angle as the astronaut looks upward, then returns to level when the astronaut lowers their head. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the astronaut in the midground. It remains mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness, tilting up and down to follow the astronaut's head movements.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing a space helmet with a clear visor, revealing their face. The individual has light skin and appears to be focused, looking intently out of a window. The helmet is predominantly dark with lighter accents, and the person is positioned in profile, facing to the left. The lighting highlights the contours of their face and helmet, emphasizing the reflective surface of the visor. The setting suggests an enclosed space, possibly a spacecraft or similar environment.",
    "Motion": "The person, wearing a space helmet, is seen in a close-up shot, with their face visible through the visor. The individual slightly moves their head, tilting it backward to look up, and their mouth is visibly moving, suggesting that they are speaking. The background consists of bookshelves filled with books, indicating an indoor environment, possibly a library or study area. The dim lighting casts shadows on the helmet and the person's face, enhancing the focus on their expression and the details of the helmet.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors within a dimly lit space. The primary visual element is a bookshelf densely packed with books, their spines facing outward. Positioned in profile before the bookshelf is an individual wearing a white and grey astronaut helmet featuring a clear visor, through which their face is visible. The lighting is low, casting shadows and highlighting reflections on the helmet's visor. Throughout the video, the individual's head shifts slightly.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot frames a person wearing a space helmet on the right side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. On the left, a bookshelf spans the entire frame, extending from the foreground to the background, with some book spines visible in the foreground on the far left. The person, shown in profile looking towards the left, slightly tilts their head upwards before returning to the initial side view. The camera maintains a position level with the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
