  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a man with light brown skin, a black afro, a mustache, and a light goatee stands in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. He wears a long-sleeved, textured red sweater and a silver necklace with a small pendant. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking downward at the man, and is tilted counterclockwise twice, resulting in a series of Dutch angle shots. The video is filmed from an unsteady, high, eye-level angle with mild barrel distortion. The camera performs two rapid counterclockwise rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the man in the foreground, and the quick movements produce noticeable motion blur. He gestures with both hands raised and open, moving his entire body while performing lyrics. His hands move around the central area of the frame. In the middle ground to the right, a large, round mirror is positioned next to a vertical orange neon light. In the background, a television displaying static is located behind the man's head, with a purple neon sign to its left. The floor and lower walls in the background are covered in a checkerboard pattern. The indoor room has a retro aesthetic, featuring a black-and-white checkerboard pattern on the floor and lower walls. The space is dimly lit with a green and teal glow, accented by a vertical orange neon light beside a large, round, wood-framed mirror. In the background, a purple neon sign is mounted on the wall near a vintage television displaying static. Behind his right shoulder, a shelf displays female mannequin heads with long hair. The man dynamically performs lyrics in the center of the room, continuously gesturing with his arms and moving his entire body in sync with the rhythm.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
