  "merged_caption": "This medium shot initially frames a light-skinned man wearing a blue short-sleeved t-shirt and a beige apron in the right middle ground, with a large, open grey insulated bag occupying the left foreground. The man stands over the bag, moving his hands near the top. The scene is set within a brightly lit commercial kitchen during the daytime, featuring stainless steel work surfaces and various kitchen equipment, including three large stand mixers. In the left background, another person is visible from the back, wearing a dark blue shirt and a light blue apron tied at their waist, working near a window. The camera, positioned at a high, eye-level angle, smoothly pans slightly to the right, following the man in the apron as he turns to his left and steps towards a counter. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the midground in sharp focus. As he moves, he ends up in the center of the frame, standing by a counter that enters from the right edge.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set within a brightly lit commercial kitchen during the daytime. In the middle ground, a person wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron stands before a large, rectangular, grey insulated delivery bag with black interior straps. The background features stainless steel work surfaces, various kitchen equipment including three large stand mixers, and another individual working near a window. The person in the middle ground moves their hands and then turns toward a counter as the camera pans slightly to the right.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot initially frames a man in the right middle ground, with a large, open insulated bag occupying the left foreground. The man in the middle ground turns and moves toward the right, and the camera pans slightly to the right to follow his motion.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
