  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a light-skinned human hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, spanning both the foreground and middle ground due to the extremely shallow focus. It holds a small, light gray, cylindrical object at the mouth of a stylized head sculpture, which is located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The sculpture is rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style, with its features formed by flat, angular planes and a matte, light gray color. The background is dark and out of focus, with cool, greenish-toned lighting illuminating the central objects. A very small white [28] is visible in the lower left corner of the screen. The scene remains completely still throughout the video, with no discernible movement from the hand, object, or sculpture. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level but slightly at a high angle, moving forward and rolling counterclockwise with noticeable unsteadiness. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the hand inserts the cylindrical object into the mouth of the polygonal sculpture. The exact camera height is difficult to determine due to the lack of background information.",

    "Subject": "A close-up shot shows a light-skinned human hand holding a small, light gray, cylindrical object near the mouth of a stylized head sculpture. The sculpture is rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style, with its features formed by flat, angular planes. It is a matte, light gray color and is seen in profile. The hand appears stationary, making it look as though it might be pushing or pulling the cylindrical piece between the sculpture's abstract lips.",
    "Motion": "A hand holds a small, white, cylindrical object near the mouth of a stylized, geometric head sculpture. The scene remains completely still throughout the video, with no discernible movement from the hand, object, or sculpture.",
    "Scene": "In a close-up shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, a hand places a small, light gray, cylindrical object into the mouth of a light gray, geometric head sculpture. The sculpture is rendered in a low-polygon style, with angular, faceted features and a matte finish. The background is dark and out of focus, with cool, greenish-toned lighting illuminating the central objects. A very small white [28] is visible in the lower left corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
