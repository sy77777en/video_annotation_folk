  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot of a 2D video, an animated man with a stylized, angular appearance, pale skin, intense dark eyes, and spiky black hair is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, seated at a light-brown counter that spans the foreground. He is dressed in a white t-shirt and a black jacket with a high collar. A pile of cards and keys rests on the counter in the bottom-left foreground. To his right, the left side of the frame, and behind him, a large, translucent, glowing pink humanoid entity with two bright, glowing white eyes occupies the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. The dimly lit indoor setting is bathed in a reddish-pink glow, with simple, dark tables faintly visible in the background. The entity's arm moves from behind the man, extending forward over the counter toward the pile of items in the bottom-left. Initially, the man is looking down at an open pink wallet in his left hand while his right hand reaches across the counter to grab a key. The entity attempts to take the key from him, and a golden crown briefly appears on its head. The man then places the wallet on the counter and engages in a struggle with the entity to retain possession of the key. The camera smoothly zooms in on the animated man sitting at the table, focusing on him as he pulls his right hand back toward his body.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
