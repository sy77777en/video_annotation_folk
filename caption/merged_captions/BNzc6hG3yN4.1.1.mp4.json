  "merged_caption": "In an initial full shot from a level perspective, two dark-skinned men are positioned in the middle ground, with one in the center-left wearing a black patterned coat over a black hooded sweatshirt and a gray-and-white scarf, gesturing toward the camera, and the other to his right in a black hooded sweatshirt with a graphic on the chest and a silver necklace, also gesturing. They stand near three custom all-terrain vehicles, with the closest ATV on the right having a purple seat, wide tires, and iridescent blue and purple details on its frame and fenders. Further back, a man wearing a black beanie and black hooded sweatshirt sits on a pink and black ATV, with another man in a black jacket and a red beanie standing behind him near another ATV. The scene is set in a large, paved industrial lot at dusk, with a pale sky visible above a line of distant buildings and shipping containers. A wooden pallet rests on the ground nearby. The camera begins with a smooth, hip-level, level-angle shot of the four men and then cranes up, transitioning to a bird's-eye angle, overhead level view. As the camera cranes upward, the two men in the front transition from the middle ground to the foreground, with the man in the black hoodie now in the center-left of the frame, the man in the patterned coat partially visible at the bottom-center, the purple-seated ATV on the center-right, and the pink ATV going out of frame from the top. The man in the black hoodie raises his forearms toward his chest. A deep focus is used throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp, while the wooden pallet briefly appears in the top-left during the process but soon disappears from the top.",

    "Subject": "In the middle ground, two dark-skinned men are featured.

    "Motion": "Two men gesture and move their bodies while facing the camera in an industrial lot. The man in the middle ground, wearing a patterned coat, gestures with his hands, while another man in a black hoodie moves behind him. The camera then cranes up to a bird's eye angle shot, where the man in the black hoodie raises his forearms toward his chest. Three all-terrain vehicles remain stationary in the middle ground, while two other people exhibit minor movements.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a large, paved industrial lot at dusk, with a pale sky visible above a line of distant buildings and shipping containers. Several customized all-terrain vehicles are parked on the asphalt. One ATV on the right has a purple seat and iridescent, multi-colored bodywork with wide tires. Another ATV is pink and black. A wooden pallet rests on the ground nearby. The camera's perspective shifts from a hip-level view to a high-angle, top-down shot, focusing on the vehicles with purple seats and the men wearing jackets over black hoodies near it.",
    "Spatial": "In an initial full shot from a level perspective, two men are positioned in the middle ground, with one in the center-left and the other to his right. There are two additional men in the further middle ground. In the middle ground, a purple-seated ATV is on the right, while another ATV with a rider is in the center. A fourth man stands in the further middle ground. The camera then cranes directly upward, transitioning to a bird's eye angle, overhead level view. From this new perspective, the man in the black hoodie is now in the center-left of the frame, the man in the patterned coat is partially visible at the bottom-center, the purple-seated ATV is on the center-right, and the pink ATV goes out of frame from the top at last, with a wooden pallet briefly appearing in the top-left during the process but soon disappearing from the top. As the camera cranes upward, the two men in the front transition from the middle ground to the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
