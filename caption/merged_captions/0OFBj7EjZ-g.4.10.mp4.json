  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of two posters hanging from black binder clips against a dark background in a dimly lit interior. Initially, both posters are dimly lit, with the left poster positioned in the center-left of the frame and the right poster next to it. The left poster is in the foreground, while the right poster appears obscured in the middle ground due to the camera's left-leaning angle and dim lighting. As the scene progresses, a spotlight abruptly turns on, illuminating the left poster, which features the word \"Glue\" in a large, black, sans-serif font on its upper half. Below the text is a color photograph of a short, cylindrical, metallic-looking object with a hole in its center, resting on a dark, gridded surface. This poster becomes the focal point, with its bright white surface contrasting against the dark surroundings. The right poster remains in shadow, maintaining its position in the middle ground, showing a black rectangular space. Light-colored lines are visible in the background from which the posters are suspended. The camera effectively uses a level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field to keep the paper in sharp focus, as it moves forward and pans smoothly from left to right, emphasizing the posters' details and their spatial relationship within the frame. The two posters hang motionless throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, indoor setting, two posters hang from binder clips against a black background. The poster on the left is white and brightly illuminated by a spotlight. It displays the word \"Glue\" in bold, black letters above a photograph of a reflective, cylindrical object with a central hole. To the right, a second poster is mostly in shadow, showing a black rectangular space. Light-colored lines are visible in the background from which the posters are suspended.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
