  "merged_caption": "A shoulder-up shot frames a humanoid figure resembling a young boy in the left foreground, positioned at eye level with the camera. The figure, with short, curly black hair and a mannequin-like face, wears a blue shirt and has pale, light-bluish skin. It looks over its left shoulder toward a closed white door located in the center background. The scene is set within a dimly lit room, bathed in a cool, blue-toned light, with lighter blue-gray walls contrasted by white baseboards and a white light switch plate visible to the right of the door. A wooden floor with a herringbone pattern occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera begins at a Dutch angle and performs a subtle, complex movement, craning around the figure while slightly rolling clockwise. Initially, the shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the humanoid figure. As the camera's focus transitions to the door in the background, the figure in the foreground becomes slightly blurry while the door comes into sharp focus. During this shift, a few small, glowing specks of light drift slowly in the air near the top of the door, and small, dust-like particles float faintly in the air.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, the camera begins at a Dutch angle and performs a subtle, complex movement, craning around a human-like figure while slightly rolling clockwise. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the foreground figure before executing a rack focus to the door in the background.",
    "Subject": "The video features a humanoid figure, resembling a young boy, positioned on the left side of the frame. The figure has short, curly black hair and is wearing a blue shirt. Its skin is a pale, light-bluish color, and its face is featureless, giving it a mannequin-like appearance. The figure is shown from a front-side profile, looking over its left shoulder. Initially, the figure is in sharp focus, but the focus then shifts to a white door in the background, rendering the humanoid figure slightly blurry.",
    "Motion": "The humanoid figure remains stationary, looking over its left shoulder toward a closed door. The camera's focus transitions from the figure in the foreground to the door in the background. As this happens, a few small, glowing specks of light drift slowly in the air near the top of the door.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit room, bathed in a cool, blue-toned light. A closed, white, paneled interior door with a dark lever handle is positioned in the background. The surrounding walls are a lighter shade of blue-gray, contrasted by white baseboards and a white light switch plate visible to the right of the door. A wooden floor with a herringbone pattern is visible at the bottom of the scene. In the foreground, a figure with black hair is seen from a front-side profile, looking towards the closed door. Small, dust-like particles float faintly in the air.",
    "Spatial": "A shoulder-up shot frames a humanoid figure in the left foreground, positioned at eye level with the camera. The figure looks toward a closed white door located in the center background. To the right of the door, a light switch is visible on the wall in the background, while a wooden floor occupies the bottom of the frame. The focus then shifts from the humanoid figure to the door, causing the figure in the foreground to become slightly blurry while the door in the background comes into sharp focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
