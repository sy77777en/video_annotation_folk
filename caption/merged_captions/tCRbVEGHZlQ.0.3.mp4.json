  "merged_caption": "A black stick figure stands on a black horizontal line with sparse tufts of green grass, set against a plain white background. The character, depicted with a round head, a thin torso, and slender limbs, holds an orange phone to its head with its left arm, which is bent. The figure appears to make a call and then lowers its arm to its side. Suddenly, the character appears to become stronger. The scene is a minimalist, two-dimensional animated environment, with the overall style being stark and simple, defined by these few elements. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's height throughout the scene, capturing the entire sequence without any movement.",

    "Camera": "This is a static shot of an illustrated 2D animation with no camera movement.",
    "Subject": "A black stick figure character is depicted with a round head, a thin torso, and slender limbs. The character is holding an orange phone, making a call, and then lowers its hand.",
    "Motion": "A black stick figure stands holding an orange phone with its left hand, appearing to make a call. It then lowers the phone and suddenly appears to become stronger.",
    "Scene": "In a minimalist, two-dimensional animated scene set against a plain white background, a single black horizontal line delineates the ground. Scattered along this line are a few sparse tufts of dark green, sketch-like grass. A black stick figure stands on this surface, holding an orange phone. The character makes a call and then lowers its hand. The overall style is stark and simple, with the environment defined by these few elements.",
    "Spatial": "A black stick figure stands on a black horizontal line with sparse tufts of green grass. Initially, the character holds an orange phone to its head with its left arm, which is bent. The figure then lowers its arm to its side. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's height throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
