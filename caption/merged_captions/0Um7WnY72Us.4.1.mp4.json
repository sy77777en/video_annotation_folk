  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a shirtless man with a light skin tone, seated in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. He has medium-length, dark, wavy hair and a beard, with a neutral expression. His torso, marked with visible bruises and wounds, particularly on his chest and shoulder, is prominently displayed. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing him from the waist up with a shallow focus. The setting is indoors in a dimly lit room, which is chaotic and disorganized. The walls are densely covered with various papers and documents, occupying a substantial part of the upper and right sections of the frame, creating a cluttered backdrop. In the bottom right corner, in the foreground, a desk is partially visible, cluttered with scattered papers. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows, and the overall color palette is muted. The camera moves backward and downward smoothly and slowly, revealing more of the man's torso while maintaining a mostly consistent shot size. The subject remains seated and motionless, except for blinking one time, throughout the entire video. The camera angle and framing stay constant, focusing on the subject and the immediate surroundings without any significant shifts or transitions. The setting suggests a workspace or study area, adding to the sense of a personal or investigative environment. The scene remains static, emphasizing the enclosed, intimate nature of the space.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow focus. It moves backward and downward smoothly and slowly, maintaining minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a shirtless man with a light skin tone, sitting and facing forward. He has medium-length, dark, wavy hair and a beard. His expression is neutral. His torso is marked with visible bruises and wounds, particularly on his chest and shoulder. The setting suggests an indoor environment with papers on the wall behind him.",
    "Motion": "The video features a shirtless man with visible bruises and wounds on his chest and shoulder, sitting and facing forward. The background consists of a wall covered with various papers and documents. The camera zooms out, revealing more of the man's torso. The subject remains seated and motionless, except for blinking one time, throughout the entire video.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit room which is chaotic and disorganized. The walls are covered with various papers and documents, fixed in place, creating a backdrop of scattered information. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows. The setting suggests a workspace or study area, with a desk partially visible, adding to the sense of a personal or investigative environment. The overall color palette is muted. The scene remains static, emphasizing the enclosed, intimate nature of the space.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium shot of a shirtless man seated in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. His torso, marked with bruises and wounds, is prominently displayed. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, captures him from the waist up, with a subtle backward and downward movement that reveals more of the scene and the man's body, while maintaining a mostly consistent shot size. The wall, densely covered with papers and documents, occupies a substantial part of the upper and right sections of the frame, creating a cluttered backdrop. In the bottom right corner, in the foreground, a desk is partially visible, cluttered with scattered papers. The man remains stationary, with no noticeable changes in his position or the arrangement of elements around him. The camera angle and framing stay constant, focusing on the subject and the immediate surroundings without any significant shifts or transitions."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
