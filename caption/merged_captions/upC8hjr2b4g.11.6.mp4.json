  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring multiple figures arranged with significant depth. In the foreground, the backs of several seated figures occupy the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. The central focus is in the middle ground, where a single figure stands in the center, facing away from the camera. This individual is positioned before a line of standing figures, also in the middle ground, who are illuminated and face forward. Among them, a prominent figure with arms crossed is located in the center-right. The composition creates a clear aisle on the tiled floor between the two rows of seated figures, leading the eye from the foreground to the central confrontation in the middle ground, all set against a dark background. In the right background of the frame, two additional figures are positioned in the corner against the wall. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The video begins with a wide shot of a room where a central figure, a man with arms crossed, stands out in the center, illuminated by a focused light. The camera smoothly moves forward over the audience, revealing more details of the central man and the surrounding figures, who are uniformly colored and mostly positioned in a line behind him. Both the seated and standing figures remain stationary throughout the video. The background is a dimly lit, empty room, emphasizing the central figure's prominence. As the camera continues to move forward, the details of the seated figures in the foreground become clearer, showing their silhouetted shapes. The overall atmosphere is formal and structured, with the central figure remaining the focal point throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The primary emphasis is on the men under the spotlight, drawing the viewer's attention to them. The camera moves smoothly forward over the audience throughout the video, maintaining steadiness without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a central figure, a man standing confidently with arms crossed, wearing a light-colored suit. He is positioned prominently in the center, illuminated by a focused light, which highlights his authoritative presence. Behind him, several other figures are standing in a line, dressed in similar attire, contributing to a formal or observational setting. In front of the central figure, one individual is positioned with his head down, facing him. All the figures appear to be wearing the same color, with shadows creating the illusion of variation. The overall composition suggests a scene of focus and attention on the central figure, with the surrounding individuals contributing to a structured and formal atmosphere.",

    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of gray. The environment resembles a dimly lit room with a tiled floor, where several figures are positioned. In the foreground, seated figures face a group of standing figures in the middle ground. Contrary to the initial description, the standing figures are mostly arranged in a line, with two figures prominently illuminated in the center. One of these figures is facing the line, while the other is positioned to the front right of the figure facing the line. The seated figures are in shadow, creating a contrast with the lit background. The room's atmosphere is subdued, with minimalistic design elements. An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video reads \"[26]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
