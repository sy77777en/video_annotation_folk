  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a dark, blocky shipwreck resting on its side at the bottom of the sea, positioned centrally in the middle ground and angled slightly from the top left towards the bottom right. The shipwreck is surrounded by deep, murky blue water with some particulate matter visible, and some metallic and possibly rusted sections are discernible. A small, beige rectangular overlay with the number \"1901\" is present in the bottom left corner throughout the video. The camera is underwater, initially at a high angle looking down at the sunken shipwreck. It steadily tilts up while panning left, revealing the surrounding blue water. As the camera continues to tilt, it slightly zooms in to emphasize a diver who comes into view, silhouetted against the lighter blue water. The diver, wearing a full-body wetsuit, a helmet, and shoes, is stationary and suspended in the water, tethered by a thin line extending upwards. The camera eventually transitions to a worm's eye angle, positioned below the diver, with the line extending upwards from the diver towards the top of the frame, also in the middle ground. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field. As the scene transitions to a full shot of the silhouetted diver in the center middle ground, the \"1901\" overlay partially disappears, leaving only \"19\" visible.",

The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "The video initially shows a dark, blocky shipwreck resting on the seabed in murky blue water, with some metallic and possibly rusted sections visible. The view then transitions upwards, away from the shipwreck, to reveal a diver. The diver, silhouetted against the lighter blue water, is wearing a full-body wetsuit, a helmet, and shoes, and is tethered by a thin line extending upwards.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a sunken shipwreck on the seabed, with the year '1901' displayed in the lower left corner. The camera then tilts upward, revealing the surrounding blue water. As the camera continues to tilt, a diver comes into view, suspended in the water and tethered by a thin line. The diver remains stationary, floating in the blue water, with the line extending upwards.",
    "Scene": "The video opens on a dark shipwreck lying on its side at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by deep blue water with some particulate matter visible. The scene then transitions to a wider view of the blue water, where a diver in a dark, full-body suit is seen stationary, attached to a thin line extending upwards. A small, beige rectangular overlay with the number \"1901\" is present in the bottom left corner throughout the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot of a dark shipwreck, positioned centrally in the middle ground and angled slightly from the top left towards the bottom right. A small, beige \"1901\" overlay is fixed in the bottom left. The scene transitions to a full shot of a silhouetted diver, who appears in the center middle ground, suspended in the blue water, with the camera now positioned below them. A thin tether line extends upwards from the diver towards the top of the frame, also in the middle ground, while the \"1901\" overlay partially disappears, leaving only \"19\" visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
