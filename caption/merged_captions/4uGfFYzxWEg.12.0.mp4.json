  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot, with three low-polygon humanoid figures on a large red cube occupying the center of the frame. One figure, dressed in a dark blue shirt and light-colored pants, is on the left side of the cube, another in a reddish-brown outfit is on the right, and a translucent greenish figure is positioned behind them. The camera, from a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective, slowly zooms out, transitioning into a high-angle wide shot that reveals a massive, static crowd of similar grey, low-polygon figures surrounding the central cube. As the camera continues to zoom out, the crowd fills the entire frame, with the initial subjects on the cube remaining in the center, now significantly smaller in scale. The entire assembly is divided by lighting, with a bright white light illuminating the figures on the left and a reddish light cast upon those on the right. The crowd is starkly lit, with the figures on the left illuminated by a bright white light and those on the right bathed in a red glow. The three figures seated on the cube, as well as the figures in the surrounding crowd, remain completely motionless throughout the shot. An overlay of white text in the bottom left corner reads \"[20]\".",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective, the camera zooms out to reveal a growing crowd of low-poly figures surrounding three central characters. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire expanding scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video centers on three low-polygon humanoid figures on a large red cube. A figure on the left, dressed in a dark blue shirt and light-colored pants, sits leaning forward with its elbows on its knees. To its left, another figure in a reddish-brown outfit sits with one elbow raised. Seated behind these two is a translucent, greenish figure. A vast crowd of similar low-polygon, grey-colored humanoid figures stands around the cube, oriented in various directions. The crowd is starkly lit, with the figures on the left illuminated by a bright white light and those on the right bathed in a red glow.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly zooms out, revealing a vast, static crowd of low-polygon figures that surrounds a central red cube. The three figures seated on the cube, as well as the figures in the surrounding crowd, remain completely motionless throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, abstract environment, three stylized, low-polygon figures are positioned on a large, red geometric block. A translucent green figure is seated behind two other seated figures, one dressed in blue and white and the other in reddish-brown. The view pulls back and up to reveal that the central block is surrounded by a massive crowd of similar grey, low-polygon figures. The entire assembly is divided by lighting, with a bright white light illuminating the figures on the left and a reddish light cast upon those on the right. An overlay of white text in the bottom left corner reads \"[20]\".",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot, with three low-polygon figures on a red cube occupying the center of the frame. One figure is on the left side of the cube, another is on the right, and a third figure is positioned behind them. The camera then zooms out, transitioning into a high-angle wide shot that reveals a massive crowd of similar figures surrounding the central cube. As the camera continues to zoom out, the crowd fills the entire frame, with the initial subjects on the cube remaining in the center, now significantly smaller in scale. The crowd is visually divided, with the figures on the left side of the frame illuminated by a bright white light and the figures on the right bathed in a red glow."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
