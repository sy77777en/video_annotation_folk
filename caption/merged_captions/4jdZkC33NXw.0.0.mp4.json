  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet, rain-soaked urban street from a slightly elevated perspective. The scene begins with a view from the top of a descending staircase, positioned centrally in the frame, leading down to a wet road. The road runs vertically through the center, flanked by lush green trees on both sides, positioned in the middle ground. Modest residential buildings are visible on the right and left, also in the middle ground. Power lines crisscross the top of the frame, adding to the urban atmosphere, and are situated in the background. Overlay elements include white text displaying \"Nagoya, Japan\" in the center and \"10 AM - May 2021\" beneath it, which then disappear. A rain symbol appears, accompanied by a red \"14°C\" and \"Rainy weather\" in white text on a blue background, positioned at the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus throughout. It moves forward smoothly, incorporating a downward motion as it descends the stairs, with some shaking, reflecting a first-person point of view similar to the natural motion of a person walking. The camera's forward movement highlights the wet pavement and overcast sky, suggesting a calm, rainy day. The setting appears peaceful and serene, with the gentle slope of the road emphasized by the camera's descent, enhancing the sense of depth and tranquility in the scene. The rain creates a glossy sheen on the pavement, adding to the tranquil mood. The focus is on the serene environment and the interplay of rain and greenery, rather than any specific object, creating a tranquil and atmospheric mood.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
