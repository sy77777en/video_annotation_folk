  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a small, light-skinned child's hand with slightly curled fingers extending from the top edge towards the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The hand holds a small blue ball, also in the center foreground, directly above a large, round, transparent glass container with a metallic-looking rim that occupies most of the frame and sits in the middle ground. This container is filled with a multitude of small, irregularly shaped, light-colored granular pieces, possibly cereal or pet food, in mixed shades of yellow and white, visible in the middle ground and background within the container. The scene appears to be set indoors with even, diffused lighting. The child's hand, initially positioned in the center of the opening of the round container, releases the small blue ball. After releasing the ball, the hand retracts slightly, moving from the center of the frame to a position slightly towards the upper left. The ball falls downwards from its central position, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground as it moves through water towards the bottom of the container where the granular pieces are located, landing among them and sinking into them. The background outside the large round container at the frame's edges includes a striped pattern in the upper left corner, likely representing the floor, and some green elements in the upper right corner. The camera is at eye level, providing a bird's-eye view, and uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the hand in the foreground. The camera shows some minor, very smooth movement as it zooms out, enhancing the view of the scene as the action unfolds.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a small, light-skinned child's hand with slightly curled fingers, positioned at the center of a round container's opening. The container has a metallic-looking rim and appears to be transparent or translucent, revealing its contents: a multitude of small, irregularly shaped, light-colored granular pieces, possibly cereal or pet food, in mixed shades of yellow and white. The child is holding a small blue ball, which is naturally falling into the water within the container and sinking to the bottom.",
    "Motion": "The child's hand, initially positioned in the center of the opening of a round container, releases a small blue ball. After releasing the ball, the hand retracts outward from the center of the container. The ball falls downwards into the container, landing among the light-colored granular pieces and sinking into them.",
    "Scene": "A top-down POV shot shows a small, pale hand positioned above the center of a large, round, transparent glass container. The container is filled with a multitude of small, granular, multi-colored particles, predominantly light-colored with some yellow and darker specks. The scene appears to be set indoors with even, diffused lighting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
