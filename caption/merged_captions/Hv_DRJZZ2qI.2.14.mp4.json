  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot, placing a light-skinned woman with long, wavy blonde hair, wearing a white knit beanie, a black tank top, and a bright blue zip-up hoodie, in the center-left middle ground. She stands and speaks to a light-skinned man with short brown hair, a short beard, and a tattoo on his left forearm, dressed in a vibrant yellow and green long-sleeved motocross jersey with goggles resting on the back of his head, in the foreground on the right. In the left middle ground, three other people are visible: a man wearing a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and a backward baseball cap while holding a pole, and two women standing further back. The scene unfolds in a dry, hilly landscape characterized by reddish-brown earth and sparse, low-lying scrub brush, with larger red rock formations rising against an overcast sky in the background. The woman in the blue hoodie makes slight movements of her head and changes in her facial expression as she talks, while the man stands still, facing her. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, zooms in, reframing the composition to a medium close-up shot of the woman who remains in the middle ground on the center-left. The man in the yellow jersey stays in the right foreground, while the other people are no longer visible. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and due to the video's low resolution, the focus is somewhat soft, with the characters appearing clearer than the slightly blurred background. The terrain is uneven, with dirt paths winding through the arid environment, and a small group of people is gathered on one of the slopes, positioned amidst the natural scenery.",

    "Camera": "An eye-level, level-angle shot zooms in on the woman in the blue hoodie. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Due to the video's low resolution, the focus is somewhat soft, with the characters appearing clearer than the slightly blurred background.",
    "Subject": "The primary focus of the video is a light-skinned woman with long, wavy blonde hair, who is wearing a white knit beanie, a black tank top, and a bright blue zip-up hoodie. She is standing and speaking to a light-skinned man with short brown hair, a short beard, and a tattoo on his left forearm. This man is dressed in a vibrant yellow and green long-sleeved motocross jersey and has goggles resting on the back of his head. Positioned behind the main subjects are three other people observing the interaction: a man wearing a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and a backward baseball cap while holding a pole, and two women standing further back.",
    "Motion": "The woman in the blue hoodie stands and speaks to the man in the yellow jersey, with slight movements of her head and changes in her facial expression as she talks. The man stands still, facing her. In the background, three other people stand, observing the conversation.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds in a dry, hilly landscape characterized by reddish-brown earth and sparse, low-lying scrub brush. The terrain is uneven, with dirt paths winding through the arid environment. In the background, larger red rock formations rise against an overcast sky. A small group of people is gathered on one of the slopes, positioned amidst the natural scenery.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium full shot, placing a woman in a blue hoodie in the center-left middle ground and a man in a yellow jersey in the foreground on the right. In the left middle ground, three other people are visible, with a hilly, red-earth landscape in the background. The scene then zooms in, reframing the composition to a medium close-up shot of the woman who remains in the middle ground on the center-left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
