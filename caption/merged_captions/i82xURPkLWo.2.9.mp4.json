  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioned at eye level with three bonsai trees resting on a wooden surface. A deciduous bonsai with a thick, gnarled trunk and small green leaves sits in the right foreground in a dark rectangular pot. A juniper bonsai is in the center middle ground, and a third bonsai is on the left middle ground. The background consists of a blurry landscape of trees and open land under an overcast sky. The camera, in a smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focuses on the bonsai tree in the midground. It then moves upward with a slight tilt and pans to the right, causing the bonsai trees to shift toward the bottom of the frame. As the camera moves, the tops of the first two trees are revealed, showcasing their detailed branches and leaves, before they nearly move out of the frame. The canopy of the third tree remains in view. The movement stops to reveal the upper body of a man in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center, wearing a red T-shirt and with a short hairstyle. He stands with his arms raised toward a wooden structure, facing upward with a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in an activity or observing something above. The top of the juniper bonsai remains visible in the bottom center foreground. The background now shows more of the surrounding trees and a wooden structure, adding a natural setting to the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a bonsai tree in the midground. The camera moves upward with a slight tilt and pans to the right, transitioning towards the end to a slightly low-angle shot.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a medium shot of three bonsai trees. The first bonsai tree on the left has a lush, green canopy with a slightly twisted trunk, planted in a rectangular pot with moss. The second bonsai tree in the middle has dense, dark green foliage with a more intricate trunk structure, placed in a similar pot with visible soil and pebbles. The third bonsai tree on the right is taller than the other two. As the camera moves upward, the tops of the first two trees are revealed, showcasing their detailed branches and leaves, before they nearly move out of the frame. The canopy of the third tree remains in view. Eventually, the upper body of a man appears in the middle ground of the scene. He is wearing a red T-shirt and has a short hairstyle, positioned slightly to the right, facing upward with a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in an activity or observing something above. The background includes a large field with some trees and a structure in the distance, adding a natural setting to the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a static shot of three bonsai trees. The camera then moves upward, revealing the upper body of a person situated in the middle ground, standing with their arms raised toward a wooden structure.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting, several bonsai trees rest on a wooden surface. The foreground prominently features a deciduous bonsai with a thick, gnarled trunk and small green leaves, sitting in a dark rectangular pot. To the left, two bonsai trees with small green leaves add to the scene. The background, seen past a wooden railing, is a blurred natural landscape of trees and open land under an overcast sky. The camera moves upward to reveal a person in a reddish-brown shirt working on a wooden structure.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioned at eye level with the bonsai trees. A deciduous bonsai sits in the right foreground, while a juniper bonsai is in the center middle ground, and the  third bonsai is on the left middle ground. The background consists of a blurry landscape. The camera then moves upward, causing the bonsai trees to shift toward the bottom of the frame. The movement stops to reveal the upper body of a man in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center, with the top of the juniper bonsai remaining visible in the bottom center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
