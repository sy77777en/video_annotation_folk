  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a red sedan is positioned lower in the center of the frame, located in the middle ground. It drives away from the camera along a right-angled highway that stretches from the bottom center of the frame towards a steep incline in the middle of the frame. The highway, marked with yellow lines, is flanked on the left and right by a vast body of rippling water that curves steeply upward, creating a captivating visual effect. The camera, starting from an almost bird’s-eye view, maintains a consistent focus on the car as it smoothly tracks its movement from above and behind, gradually descending and moving forward to enhance the dynamic perspective. As the camera tracks forward, the car remains lower-centered while moving further into the background up the incline. The camera's height and angle are ambiguous, though it consistently focuses on the red car, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. Overlaid at the bottom of the scene is white text that reads \"CHARGES WHEN YOU PLUG-IN\" in a blocky, digital-style font with a slight glitch effect. To the right of the text is a white outline of a charging plug with a segment of wire.",

    "Camera": "In a digitally manipulated scene where the ocean curves upward around a highway, the camera's height and angle are ambiguous, though it consistently focuses on the red car. The camera quickly and smoothly tracks the red car from above and behind, starting from an almost bird’s-eye view and moving downward and forward. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A red sedan is shown in a digitally manipulated scene where the ocean curves upward around a right-angled highway.

    "Motion": "In this digitally manipulated scene, a red car drives steadily along a highway that intriguingly curves upward through an ocean, creating a captivating visual effect. The camera, starting from an almost bird’s-eye view, maintains a consistent focus on the car as it smoothly tracks its movement from above and behind, gradually descending and moving forward to enhance the dynamic perspective.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a digitally altered scene featuring a right-angled highway extending over a vast body of rippling water during the daytime. The camera consistently focuses on a single red car, maintaining a smooth tracking motion from above and behind, transitioning from a bird’s-eye view to a more forward angle. The two-lane highway, marked with yellow lines, curves upward, with the red car driving along the right side, ascending the steep incline. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the text \"CHARGES WHEN YOU PLUG-IN\" in a white, blocky font. To the right of the text is a white outline of a charging plug with a segment of wire.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot, a red car is positioned lower in the center of the frame, located in the middle ground. It drives away from the camera along a highway that stretches from the bottom center of the frame towards a steep incline in the middle of the frame. The highway is flanked on the left and right by a body of water that curves steeply upward. As the camera tracks forward, the car remains lower-centered while moving further into the background up the incline. An overlay text spans across the bottom of the screen, with an overlay icon on the bottom right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
