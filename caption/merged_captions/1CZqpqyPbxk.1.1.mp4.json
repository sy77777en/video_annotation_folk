  "merged_caption": "The video shows a static screen recording of a video editing software interface. In the central area of the frame, there is an image with a green tint, depicting a person holding a camera in profile view. This image is positioned at the top-center of the frame. The editing software's interface surrounds the image, with various controls and tools occupying the top, bottom, and sides of the screen. The color wheels and scopes are located at the bottom, while the timeline and playback controls are situated along the top and bottom edges. Throughout the video, the image gradually becomes brighter and its contrast is enhanced. The camera angle remains fixed, providing a direct view of the software interface and the image being adjusted. The main focus is on a static photograph of a person holding a camera, viewed in profile, with their head slightly tilted forward and the camera held close to their face, remaining motionless during the shot. The person appears to be concentrating on taking a photograph, with their eyes focused on the subject. The camera is held with both hands, and the person's facial features are partially visible due to the lighting. The video is a screen recording of an image editing app interface, showcasing the editing process of a photograph. The image being edited features a person with short hair, viewed in profile, holding a camera close to their face. The person appears to be concentrating on taking a photograph, with their head slightly tilted forward. The camera is held with both hands, and the person's facial features are partially visible due to the lighting. The software interface provides a structured and technical setting. The overall color scheme is dark, with the green-tinted video clip contrasting against the darker interface. The screen's brightness and the software's dark theme suggest a focus on clarity and detail.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
