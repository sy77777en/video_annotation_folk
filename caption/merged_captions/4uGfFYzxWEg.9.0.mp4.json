  "merged_caption": "The scene displays a static graphic composition with a bar chart occupying the center, featuring a y-axis label on its left and an x-axis label below it at the bottom center. The chart's title, \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whitlock,\" is situated above the bars at the top center. A red vertical line is positioned towards the right side of the chart's main distribution peak. Additional text is located at the bottom center, while a watermark reads, \"Liam Shaw - A Statistical Analysis of Coughing Patterns on 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' (2020)\" in the bottom left. The video begins with this bar chart showing a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis. As the video progresses, the camera features a smooth, slow zoom-in on the bar chart, making the details of the data points and the red vertical line more prominent. The environment is minimalistic, emphasizing the chart's details. There are no changes in the spatial arrangement of these elements during the video.",

The chart displays data related to simulations of coughs, with the x-axis labeled for coughs during specific periods and the y-axis indicating the number of simulations. A red vertical line marks a specific data point on the chart. The environment is minimalistic, emphasizing the chart's details. Overlay elements include text in the bottom left corner that reads, \"Liam Shaw - A Statistical Analysis of Coughing Patterns on 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' (2020),\" along with a title and watermark at the bottom, indicating the source and topic of the analysis. The overall scene is static, with no visible changes in time or motion.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
