  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a person with medium-length, slightly wavy brown-red hair, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with their chest-up body and head filling most of the frame. Positioned in the foreground, the person faces a closed door that spans the entire background of the frame. The person raises their left hand, moving it towards the door to knock. This action occurs on the left side of the frame, indicating a slight shift in the subject's arm position. The camera maintains a steady angle at the subject's height throughout, capturing the interaction between the person and the door without any noticeable changes in shot size or perspective. The overall spatial framing focuses on the subject's back and the door, emphasizing the knocking gesture. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, focusing on the person in the foreground. The person, wearing a white collared shirt, is seen from behind as they knock on a closed door with their left hand. The person continues to knock on the door in a rhythmic manner. After knocking, the person lowers their hand and remains still, facing the door. The video depicts an outdoor setting in front of a closed door, likely part of a residential building. The scene is captured during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. The door is a neutral color, possibly beige or light gray, with a smooth surface and subtle paneling. The environment is calm, with the person actively knocking on the door, adding a sense of motion to the scene. The focus remains on the interaction with the door.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
