  "merged_caption": "In a largely static medium shot filmed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera is positioned at the subjects' level in a dimly lit, cavernous indoor space with a cool, blue-green color cast and soft, hazy light from an unseen source above, suggesting a hangar or warehouse. Initially, the back of a person occupies the left foreground, blurred due to the shallow depth of field. As the video progresses, a hand enters from the left side of the frame, holding a dark hood, and places it over this person's head. In the middle ground, a man with a prominent mustache and beard stands slightly right of center, wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch over a dark shirt while holding a rifle across his chest. To his left, closer to the right edge of the frame, stands a woman with shoulder-length, light brown hair, dressed in a light-colored collared jacket over a dark top. Both are looking toward the person in the foreground. A small portion of another person's shoulder is faintly visible in the right foreground. The scene is largely static, but as the camera zooms in towards the end of the scene, the man and woman in the background exchange glances, appearing to communicate silently with each other. The framing and positions of all subjects remain unchanged throughout the clip, with the camera maintaining a slightly unsteady, static shot from an eye-level perspective with a level angle, keeping the man in the beanie in focus while the person in the foreground remains blurred.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, static shot from an eye-level perspective with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the beanie in the midground in focus while the person in the foreground is blurred.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit scene, a man with a prominent mustache and beard stands slightly to the right of the center, wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch over a dark shirt while holding a rifle across his chest. To his left, a woman with shoulder-length, light brown hair is visible, dressed in a light-colored jacket over a dark top. Both are looking toward a third individual in the foreground. As the video progresses, a hand holding a mask enters from the left side of the frame and places it over the head of the person in the foreground. Additionally, a small portion of another person's shoulder is faintly visible on the right side of this individual.",
    "Motion": "The scene is largely static, with a man and a woman in the background standing still and looking toward a person in the foreground. A hand then enters the frame from the left and places a dark hood over the head of the individual in the foreground. As the camera zooms in towards the end of the scene, the man and woman in the background exchange glances, appearing to communicate silently with each other.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a large, dimly lit indoor space. The environment is dark and cavernous, with a cool, blue-green color cast and soft, hazy light coming from an unseen source above. The background is indistinct, suggesting a hangar or warehouse. Slightly to the right of the center, a man wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch holds a rifle. To his left stands a woman in a light-colored collared jacket.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
