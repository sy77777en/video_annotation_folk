  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast, dark cityscape under a heavily overcast sky. Initially, a large, robed statue stands in the center middle ground, surrounded by ornate, classical-style stone buildings. A circular plaza filled with swarming, indistinct dark figures and small explosions occupies the middle ground, while towering, futuristic skyscrapers rise in the background. The foreground features a few large birds occasionally flying by. The camera begins with a smooth, aerial rightward truck movement, surveying the war-torn city. As the camera transitions from a level angle to a high angle, it looks down on the destruction, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire cityscape sharp. The central statue collapses on its own, falling sideways and slightly backward, crashing into the middle ground plaza and sending up a large cloud of dust and debris from the bottom center of the frame. Smoke and fog drift through the streets, indicating widespread destruction, as the ground is densely covered with artillery fire and advancing troops. The shot concludes with a moderate forward dolly into the scene, capturing the oppressive atmosphere of a city under massive assault.",

    "Camera": "This smooth, aerial shot continuously trucks right to survey a war-torn city. The camera begins at a level angle and transitions to a high angle as it moves, looking down on the destruction. A deep focus keeps the entire cityscape sharp. The shot concludes with a moderate forward dolly into the scene.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dystopian cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the grand scale of destruction and the oppressive atmosphere rather than a single character or object. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to take in the full scope of the chaotic event unfolding. The scene is set in a vast, monochromatic city defined by a mix of ornate, classical architecture and towering, futuristic skyscrapers in the background, all shrouded in a dark, overcast sky. A massive, robed statue is violently toppled from its pedestal, crashing into a large circular plaza filled with swarming, indistinct dark figures and punctuated by small explosions. The air is thick with smoke and debris, conveying a powerful sense of a city under a massive assault.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a vast, dark, and futuristic cityscape under a gloomy, overcast sky. The architecture features a striking blend of ornate, classical-style buildings in the middle ground and towering, abstract skyscrapers in the distant background. Smoke and debris fill the air, indicating widespread destruction, as a massive statue crashes into a central plaza. The ground is densely covered with artillery fire and advancing troops, while a few birds can be seen flying across the foreground in the sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone pans over a vast, dark cityscape under a heavily overcast sky. The scene, rendered in a monochromatic palette of grays and blacks, features ornate, classical-style stone buildings arranged around a large, circular plaza, with taller, futuristic towers rising in the background. Smoke and fog drift through the streets, where numerous small figures are gathered. A massive stone statue of a robed figure, which initially stands in the center of the plaza, is struck and topples sideways and backward, crashing into the ground and sending up a large cloud of dust and debris as small explosions flash below.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast, dark cityscape. Initially, a large, robed statue stands in the center middle ground, surrounded by ornate buildings. A circular plaza filled with small figures and explosions occupies the middle ground, while towering, futuristic skyscrapers are visible in the background. The foreground features a few large birds occasionally flying by. The central statue collapses on its own, falling sideways and slightly backward. As it crashes into the middle ground plaza, a large cloud of dust and debris rises from the bottom center of the frame. The camera begins with a rightward truck movement, concluding with a moderate forward dolly into the scene, and shifts from a level angle to a high angle, observing the destruction from above."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
