  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot of a cityscape, captured by a drone during the daytime. A reddish-brown, metal truss bascule bridge extends almost horizontally from the left to slightly upper right of the frame, featuring stone control houses with tiled roofs at both ends. A convoy of tan military vehicles, including tanks, travels across this bridge from right to left. The wide, dark green river flows beneath the bridge, filling the majority of the frame. In the lower center right of the foreground, a bright orange tour boat filled with passengers moves down-right, while further back in the middle ground, to the left of the bridge, a larger white two-decker tour boat approaches the camera. Smaller speedboats navigate the water, leaving white wakes as they move away from the camera's position. The left riverbank occupies the bottom left foreground and middle ground, consisting of a paved road and walkway, while the right bank, visible in the middle ground to the right of the bridge, features a patch of grass and dirt. The background is composed of distant trees and buildings under a clear sky. The camera glides forward smoothly and pans slightly to the left, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, providing a comprehensive overview of the scene from an elevated viewpoint. The shot lacks a single main subject; its elevated and wide perspective is used to establish the scale of the urban environment and the juxtaposition of civilian leisure and military movement, focusing on the overall atmosphere rather than any specific character or object.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial, high-angle perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward while slightly panning left, offering a dynamic view of the bridge and the surrounding river.",
    "Subject": "This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot overlooking a wide, dark river flowing through a city. A prominent reddish-brown bascule bridge, distinguished by its truss structure and two stone control towers located at each end, spans the water, with a convoy of tan military vehicles crossing it from right to left. The river is active with various watercraft, including a bright orange tour boat filled with passengers in the foreground, a larger white tour boat further back, and smaller speedboats leaving white wakes on the surface. The shot lacks a single main subject; its elevated and wide perspective is used to establish the scale of the urban environment and the juxtaposition of civilian leisure and military movement. The focus is on the overall atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific character or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a high-angle, daytime shot of a large, reddish-brown bascule bridge spanning a wide city river. The bridge is occupied by a convoy of military tanks. Several tour boats and other vessels are present in the water below and around the bridge.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a daytime scene over a wide, dark green river flowing through a city. A reddish-brown, metal truss bascule bridge spans the water, featuring stone control houses with tiled roofs at both ends. A convoy of tan military vehicles is in motion on the bridge. In the river below, several boats, including a large two-decker tour boat and a smaller orange vessel, move through the water, leaving wakes behind them. The riverbanks consist of a paved road and walkway on one side and a patch of grass and dirt on the other, with trees and buildings visible in the background under a clear sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
