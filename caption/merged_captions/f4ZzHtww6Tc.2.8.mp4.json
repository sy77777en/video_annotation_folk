  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot as a man with light skin and visible tattoos on his arms and neck, wearing a tan short-sleeved button-up shirt, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a black baseball cap, glides out from behind the concrete steps on a skateboard. A black metal handrail is visible in the middle ground, running from the left along a sloped grassy area towards the center-right. Green tree leaves are in the extreme foreground, partially framing the top and left edges of the scene, while a tree trunk stands in the middle ground, right of center. The man approaches a set of stairs and jumps from the steps onto the handrail, grinding from left to right across the center of the frame, remaining in the middle ground and initially maintaining the full shot. The camera, at eye level, pans to the right and zooms in, tracking his movement. As he slides down the railing, the camera tilts down, then zooms in and tilts up as he lands on the concrete sidewalk in the foreground and skates further to the right. The shot dynamically transitions to a medium close-up of him, and the house with red brick and white porch columns shifts to the right and into the background, while the sidewalk becomes prominent in the bottom foreground. Throughout this sequence, other houses, parked cars, and trees form the distant background. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, maintaining a level angle with a brief high-angle shot before returning to level. The video starts with deep focus but transitions to out-of-focus near the end, capturing the skateboarder as he becomes larger in the frame.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, mostly maintaining a level angle with a brief high-angle shot before returning to level. The video starts with deep focus but transitions to out-of-focus near the end. The camera pans right to track the skateboarder, who becomes larger in the frame. During this tracking, the camera tilts down as the skateboarder slides down the railing, then zooms in and tilts up at the end. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video focuses on a man with light skin and visible tattoos on his arms and neck, who enters the frame skateboarding. He wears a tan short-sleeved button-up shirt, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a black baseball cap. The camera tracks him as he performs a trick, jumping onto a railing and then back to the ground, with the view of him transitioning from a full shot to a medium close-up as the video progresses.",
    "Motion": "A man on a skateboard approaches a set of stairs and begins to descend them. He then jumps onto a black metal railing, sliding down it while maintaining balance. After landing on the ground, he continues to skate forward, moving away from the railing. The background features a brick house with white columns and a porch, and there are yellow flowers and greenery around the area. In the second half of the video, several cars are visible parked along the roadside.",
    "Scene": "The video is an objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. It is set outdoors in a sunlit residential neighborhood where a red brick house with white porch columns and a white balustrade is prominent, featuring light blue-grey concrete steps to one side. Adjacent to the house, a sloped grassy area with two clusters of yellow flowers descends towards a concrete sidewalk. A black metal handrail lines the edge of this grassy incline. Beyond the sidewalk, an asphalt street with parked cars, other houses, and green trees form the background. Green tree leaves are visible in the foreground, partially framing the scene where a skateboarder moves along the handrail and onto the sidewalk.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot as a man in the midground glides out from behind the concrete steps. A black metal handrail is visible in the middle ground, running from the left along a sloped grassy area towards the center-right. Green tree leaves are in the extreme foreground, partially framing the top and left edges of the scene, while a tree trunk stands in the middle ground, right of center. The man, skating on a skateboard, jumps from the steps onto the handrail, grinding from left to right across the center of the frame, remaining in the middle ground and initially maintaining the full shot. The camera pans to the right and zooms in, tracking his movement. As he lands on the concrete sidewalk in the foreground and skates further to the right, the shot dynamically transitions to a medium close-up of him. Consequently, the house and porch shift to the right and into the background, while the sidewalk becomes prominent in the bottom foreground. Throughout this sequence, other houses, parked cars, and trees form the distant background, and the camera maintains a height level with the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
