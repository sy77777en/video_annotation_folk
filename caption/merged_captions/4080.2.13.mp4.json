  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a person with a light-to-medium skin tone is framed in profile, initially slightly to the right of the center of the screen, gradually shifting towards the left side of the frame. The subject is positioned in the middle ground, with a dark, out-of-focus element in the foreground obscuring the bottom portion of the frame. A diffuse blue light occupies the background. The camera, with an extremely shallow depth of field, initially focuses on the person's eyes in the midground. As the camera makes a minor, smooth movement, panning from left to right and slightly moving backward, the focus shifts and the person's eyes become out of focus. The person remains mostly still throughout the video, with subtle movements such as slow blinking, a slight head turn to the left, and a gentle lowering of the head. The shot highlights their eye, which has long eyelashes, and a small, dark, teardrop-shaped tattoo on their cheek just below the eye. Their features are partially obscured by shadow and a shallow depth of field, creating a hazy and atmospheric quality, with warm light on their face contrasting with a cool, blue-toned background. The side of a nose and an eye with visible lashes are partially illuminated, while a dark, blurry shape occupies the foreground, obscuring the lower part of the face. A small, dark mark is present on the person's cheek. The shallow depth of field creates a hazy and indistinct quality throughout the scene. The camera remains static at the subject's level, enhancing the intimate and atmospheric quality of the scene.",

    "Camera": "With an extremely shallow depth of field, the camera initially focuses on the person's eyes in the midground. As the camera makes a minor, smooth movement, panning from left to right and slightly moving backward, the focus shifts and the person's eyes become out of focus.",
    "Subject": "A person with a light-to-medium skin tone is depicted in an extreme close-up, soft-focus profile view, facing toward the right. The shot highlights their eye, which has long eyelashes, and a small, dark, teardrop-shaped tattoo on their cheek just below the eye. Their features are partially obscured by shadow and a shallow depth of field, creating a hazy and atmospheric quality, with warm light on their face contrasting with a cool, blue-toned background.",
    "Motion": "The person remains mostly still throughout the video, with subtle movements such as slow blinking, a slight head turn to the left, and a gentle lowering of the head.",
    "Scene": "A very close-up, softly focused view shows a person's face in profile, mostly cast in shadow. The background is a diffuse, out-of-focus field of blue-green light. The side of a nose and an eye with visible lashes are partially illuminated, while a dark, blurry shape occupies the foreground, obscuring the lower part of the face. A small, dark mark is present on the person's cheek. The shallow depth of field creates a hazy and indistinct quality throughout the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme close-up shot, a person's face is framed in profile, initially slightly to the right of the center of the screen, gradually shifting towards the left side of the frame. The subject is positioned in the middle ground, with a dark, out-of-focus element in the foreground obscuring the bottom portion of the frame. A diffuse blue light occupies the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
