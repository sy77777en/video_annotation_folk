  "merged_caption": "This medium shot centers on a neon sign for \"Flo's Cafe\" in the foreground against a solid purple background. The camera smoothly tilts vertically upward, starting with a view of the words \"Flo's Cafe\" on a neon sign, which is initially unlit. The sign gradually lights up in sequence, beginning with \"Flo's,\" followed by \"Cafe,\" and finally the \"V8\" symbol at the top. The sign consists of a dark green, oval-shaped base where the words \"Flo's\" and \"Cafe\" are written in pink, cursive neon letters, each outlined with a bright turquoise glow. Rising from the center of the oval is a large \"V8\" symbol. The \"V\" is formed by two angled lines of turquoise neon outlined in pink, and the number \"8\" positioned above it is rendered in turquoise neon with a pink outline. The camera tilts upward along this large V-shaped structure that rises from the center of the sign, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire sign sharp. The shot concludes by framing the top of the sign, which features a \"V8\" logo, now positioned in the center of the frame.",

The sign displays the words \"Flo's Cafe\" in pink and turquoise cursive neon, set against a green oval background. A large, dark V-shaped structure rises from the middle of the sign. The view tilts upward along this structure to reveal a \"V8\" logo at the top, also illuminated in pink and turquoise neon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
