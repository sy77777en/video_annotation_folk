  "merged_caption": "The video utilizes a full shot, captured from a low angle looking up at a person centered in the frame, standing on a metal fire escape. This individual, largely in shadow with some areas illuminated, wears a red and white mask with clown-like features, including red hair-like elements, and dark, indistinct clothing that appears to be a shirt and pants. They hold a device resembling a rifle in a two-handed grip, with the barrel pointed upwards and slightly to one side, and the stock near their shoulder. The fire escape structure spans from the foreground into the middle ground where the person is located, while a separate fire escape appears further in the distance in the background, along with the building facade. The scene is set at night, with the fire escape's crisscrossing bars and stairs creating a complex pattern of shadows and highlights against the dimly lit building facade, which features some lighter horizontal architectural details. The overall atmosphere is shadowy and high-contrast. The camera is initially at a low angle and smoothly cranes up in an arc to capture the full body of the figure standing on the balcony, prominently featuring the grappling hook gun, with a shallow depth of field keeping the foreground in focus. During the clip, the person raises the rifle-like device to their shoulder and fires it, causing a rope with a jagged metal point to shoot upwards and to the right side of the frame. The framing of the person remains consistent, keeping their full figure in view and centered, while the intricate patterns of light and shadow cast by the fire escape and on the building shift slightly with the subject's movement.",

    "Subject": "A person is positioned on a metal fire escape, their figure largely in shadow with some areas illuminated. This individual wears a red and white mask with clown-like features, including red hair-like elements. The clothing is dark and indistinct due to low lighting, making it difficult to determine the true color, but they appear to be wearing a shirt and pants. The person holds a device resembling a rifle in a two-handed grip, with the barrel pointed upwards and slightly to one side, and the stock near their shoulder. At the start of the video, the individual raises this rifle to their shoulder and then fires it, and a rope flies out, trailing from what appears to be a jagged metal point. ",

    "Scene": "The scene is set at night, looking up at a dark metal fire escape attached to the side of a building. The fire escape features crisscrossing bars and stairs, creating a complex pattern of shadows and highlights against the dimly lit building facade. The building itself is dark, with some lighter horizontal architectural details visible. A figure is positioned on the fire escape. The overall atmosphere is shadowy and high-contrast.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
