  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court during the day, surrounded by urban elements. The main subject, a basketball with a human face and expressive features, is prominently positioned in the bottom right-center of the middle ground. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the basketball sharp while the background is blurred. The shot remains stable, with the basketball as the central focus. In the background, several people are playing basketball, dressed in casual sportswear, including one person in a green jacket and white pants and another in a blue top. Their positions vary slightly as they move, primarily located towards the top left and top right. A person in blue trousers and white sneakers runs past the basketball, which appears to be talking as its mouth opens and closes, indicating it is speaking or reacting to the game. The players continue their game, moving around the court, adding dynamic energy to the scene. The court's surface is a textured red material, and it is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls and nearby buildings, enhancing the urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting fair weather, while trees with autumn foliage add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape. The focus remains on the animated basketball, which stands out due to its unusual and eye-catching design, while the players' movements add dynamic elements to the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
