  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot, where the camera is positioned above the subjects. A man, depicted in a blue, low-polygon style with short dark hair and wearing a suit-like attire, is seated in the middle ground, on the right side of the frame, facing away from the viewer. Across a white desk, positioned in the center middle ground, sits another man, rendered in a grey, low-polygon style and wearing a simple top, in the middle ground, left of center, facing the blue man. A white microscope is on the left side of the desk in the middle ground, and a white binder with a dark spine or label is on the left side of the desk. The background features a stark, white, tiled wall spanning the width of the frame, with a clock on the top left and a simple white door on the right. A wall-mounted bookshelf with several books is also visible. The text \"1960\" is overlaid in the bottom left foreground, accompanied by another number. The camera is initially at an eye-level, high angle, then transitions to a level angle as it trucks right, moves forward, and moves downward while slightly tilting upward to capture the essence of a face-to-face conversation between the grey and blue figures inside a lab room. The camera employs shallow focus, emphasizing the middle ground, and its movement is very smooth. As the scene progresses, the camera gradually moves in an arc towards the men, transitioning to a medium-full shot of the grey man and a medium shot of the blue man. By the end of the video, the blue man is positioned in the foreground, providing a point of contrast in the monochromatic color scheme.",

    "Subject": "A man, depicted in a blue, low-polygon style with short dark hair and wearing a suit-like attire, is seated on a white chair with his back to the viewer, facing a white desk. Across this desk sits another man, rendered in a grey, low-polygon style and wearing a simple top, who is facing the seated blue man. On the left side of the white desk rests a white microscope. Positioned on the desk, between the microscope and the seated blue man, is a white binder with a dark spine or label. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"1960\" along with a number.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward while simultaneously shifting to the right and slightly downward, with an upward tilt, capturing the essence of a face-to-face conversation between a grey, low-polygon figure and a blue, low-polygon figure seated across a white desk in a lab setting.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a stark, white, tiled room, likely a laboratory or medical office, with a plain white floor and a simple white door. A white desk occupies the center, upon which sits a white microscope and a white binder. Two figures are present: one, rendered in dark grey, is seated behind the desk, while the other, in a distinct blue, is seated in a white chair in front of the desk. A circular object, likely a clock, hangs on the tiled wall, and a wall-mounted bookshelf with several books is also visible. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, with the blue figure providing a point of contrast. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"1960\" along with an additional number. The camera combines a rightward truck, forward movement, and downward movement while slightly tilting upward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
