  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot captures a person in a red and blue jacket positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, holding a large red delivery bag located in the center of the middle ground. The bag, which has black trim and velcro fasteners, is opened to reveal a red lid and a silver-lined interior. To the right, a second person wearing a light-colored apron over a blue short-sleeved shirt is partially visible in the middle ground, standing before a commercial kitchen with stainless steel counters and equipment in the out-of-focus background. The person on the left starts with the bag already open, then proceeds to fold down a small inner flap and pull the larger main lid over the top, pressing it down to close the bag. This high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the delivery person and the bag in the midground. The camera smoothly moves slightly from right to left while panning from left to right to follow the action.",

The bag, which has black trim and velcro fasteners, is opened to reveal a red lid and a silver-lined interior before being closed. Another individual wearing an apron is partially visible standing next to them.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
