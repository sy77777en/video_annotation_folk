  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot showing a cartoon boy with an atypically large and stylized hairstyle, seated at his desk, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the middle ground. His brown hair is sculpted into several large, rounded, cloud-like sections that form a voluminous bouffant. He has a light skin tone, large blue eyes with heavy eyelids, and eyebrows that are angled upwards toward the center. His mouth is slightly open and downturned. The boy is dressed in a white collared shirt and a green sweater vest. His entire upper body, head, and desk are visible, with his head and hands resting on the desk surface, and his legs partially visible, though some parts are obscured by the desk. He rests his cheek on one hand while holding a yellow pencil in the other, looking down at a piece of paper on his desk. To the left, the partial figure of another boy is visible in the foreground, with part of his head, torso, and arm shown. The window is on the left side of the frame in the background, allowing sunlight to enter, while the chalkboard is in the background on the right. A stack of books is placed in the middle ground on the left and transitions to the foreground. The desk with a piece of paper is in the center middle ground. The camera is at the same height as the seated boy, providing a straight-on view. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, cropping closer to the main boy so that only his head, shoulders, arms, and the upper part of the desk are visible, with the boy remaining centered in the frame and the camera still at his eye level. The partial figure of the other boy and some background elements become less visible or move out of frame as the shot tightens. The cartoon boy remains seated at his desk, lets out a deep sigh, and does not display any noticeable movement throughout the video. The camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground. The video takes place inside a classroom during the daytime, with sunlight streaming through a window on the left, casting natural light onto the scene. The classroom features blue walls, a large green chalkboard, and a wooden desk with a smooth surface and rounded edges. Stacks of books with colorful covers and visible spines are arranged on a nearby table, and a single piece of paper is on the wooden desk in front of the boy. The window reveals a glimpse of green foliage outside, indicating a clear day. The overall environment is tidy and organized, with simple furnishings and a calm atmosphere. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
