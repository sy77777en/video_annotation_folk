  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on a vast landscape. The frame is horizontally divided, with a dramatic sky occupying the top half and a deep canyon filling the bottom half. In the top left, the setting sun is positioned near the horizon, casting a golden glow and creating a sunburst effect. Large, dark storm clouds are situated in the top right and center-right of the frame. The expansive canyon stretches across the entire bottom of the frame, visible in the foreground, middle ground, and background, and is cast in shadow. A small, winding river is visible in the bottom left, deep within the canyon in the middle ground, reflecting the faint light from the sky. This video is a time-lapse of a dramatic sunset over a vast canyon, captured from an aerial, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire vast landscape sharp. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right. As the sun on the left slowly descends below the horizon, the clouds move quickly across the sky, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The interplay of light and shadow creates a striking contrast in the sky, enhancing the beauty of the sunset. The sky is a spectacle of contrasting elements: on the left, the setting sun creates a brilliant golden-orange glow with visible sunbeams, while on the right, dark, voluminous storm clouds gather in the distance. The clouds drift across the frame as the sun sinks, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape rather than any single object within it.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a canyon at sunset, captured from an aerial, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire vast landscape sharp. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a sunset over a vast canyon. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast in deep shadow, while a thin, reflective river winds through its base. The sky is a spectacle of contrasting elements: on the left, the setting sun creates a brilliant golden-orange glow with visible sunbeams, while on the right, dark, voluminous storm clouds gather in the distance. The clouds drift across the frame as the sun sinks, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape rather than any single object within it.",
    "Motion": "This video is a time-lapse of a dramatic sunset over a vast canyon. The clouds move quickly across the sky as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a golden glow. The interplay of light and shadow creates a striking contrast in the sky, enhancing the beauty of the sunset.",
    "Scene": "An extreme wide shot captures the Grand Canyon at sunset under a dramatic sky. On the left, the setting sun peeks over the horizon, casting a golden glow and creating a sunburst effect. The sky above is a mix of blue, illuminated white clouds, and large, dark, billowing storm clouds that dominate the right side of the frame. The vast, layered canyon below is mostly cast in deep shadow, emphasizing its depth and scale. A small, winding river snakes through the bottom of the canyon, reflecting the faint light from the sky. Throughout the scene, the clouds slowly drift and shift.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on a vast landscape.

A small, winding river is visible in the bottom left, deep within the canyon in the middle ground. In this time-lapse, the sun on the left slowly descends below the horizon, and the clouds drift across the sky. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking out over the canyon."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
