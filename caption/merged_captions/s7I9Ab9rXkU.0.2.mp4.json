  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man with a dark complexion and a full beard, wearing a dark brown hat positioned low above his eyes, with the brim flipped upward. Beneath the hat, he has a black head covering that conceals his hair and ears. He is wearing a light-colored jacket over a patterned shirt. The subject is positioned on the left side of the frame, with his face and upper torso occupying most of the shot. Both the subject and the microphone, likely mounted on a stand, are located in the foreground, with the microphone slightly to the right of the center, near the bottom of the frame. The man's head and shoulders are in the middle ground, while the background consists of wooden elements, such as shelves or paneling, which are out of focus and occupy the top and back portions of the frame. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The background is blurred, and the camera remains completely static. The man is seen speaking or singing into the microphone, with his head moving slightly as he talks. He occasionally looks up and to the side, maintaining a relaxed facial expression throughout. His facial expression appears engaged and focused, with his eyes partially closed. The overall framing remains stable, with no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame. The setting is indoors, featuring a warm, intimate environment with soft lighting that creates a cozy atmosphere. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft textures, contributing to a welcoming and comfortable ambiance. At the end, the man touches the microphone.",

    "Motion": "The man is seen speaking or singing into a microphone, with his head moving slightly as he talks.

    "Scene": "The video is set indoors, featuring a warm, intimate environment with soft lighting that creates a cozy atmosphere. The background includes wooden elements, possibly shelves or paneling, adding to the rustic charm. The setting suggests a relaxed, perhaps musical venue, with a microphone prominently in the foreground. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests an evening or dimly lit setting. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft textures, contributing to a welcoming and comfortable ambiance.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the shoulders up. The subject is positioned on the left side of the frame, with his face and upper torso occupying most of the shot. Both the subject and the microphone are located in the foreground, with the microphone slightly to the right of the center, near the bottom of the frame. The man's head and shoulders are in the middle ground, while the background consists of wooden elements, such as shelves or paneling, which are out of focus and occupy the top and back portions of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame. The man's head moves slightly, turning towards the right side of the frame during the video, but the overall framing remains stable."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
