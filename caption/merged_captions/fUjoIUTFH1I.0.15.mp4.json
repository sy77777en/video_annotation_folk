  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot captured from street level, beautifully capturing a serene cityscape of the French Quarter in New Orleans, enveloped in a picturesque fog. Initially, a large, gray-painted building with a prominent second-floor balcony featuring ornate black wrought-iron railings and hanging planters with yellow and pink flowers occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching from the left to the center of the frame. The ground floor has a series of arched doorways with black grilles, and the upper-story windows are framed by black shutters. A street is positioned at the bottom, receding into the foggy background, where other brick and stucco buildings with similar balconies are faintly visible. From a low, eye-level perspective, the camera slowly and smoothly pans right and tilts down, causing the gray building to shift toward the left edge of the frame. This movement reveals more of the street and the buildings on the right, bringing a streetlight into the foreground and several parked cars into view in the background. A portion of a white car, initially in the bottom-left foreground, exits the frame as the pan progresses. The damp asphalt street recedes into the dense fog, enhancing the moody, still atmosphere with muted gray and brick buildings featuring characteristic wrought-iron balconies and hanging flower baskets lining the wet, empty street. While parked cars are visible at the end of the street, the classic design of the buildings is effectively positioned in the middle ground and background, enhancing the overall composition. The camera gradually reveals the entire street, offering a comprehensive view of the atmospheric architecture, with the dense fog softening the architectural details in the distance, creating a sense of quiet solitude.",

    "Scene": "A quiet, foggy street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans is lined with historic buildings. The main structure is a multi-story, gray-painted building featuring a prominent second-floor balcony with ornate black wrought-iron railings, supported by slender black posts. Hanging planters with yellow and pink flowers adorn the balcony. The ground floor of the building has a series of arched doorways with black grilles, and the upper-story windows are framed by black shutters.  The damp asphalt street recedes into the dense fog, where other brick and stucco buildings with similar balconies are faintly visible. A portion of a white car is seen in the lower-left corner.As the camera pans to the right, additional details come into view, including several parked cars at the end of the street and a streetlight that becomes visible towards the conclusion of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
