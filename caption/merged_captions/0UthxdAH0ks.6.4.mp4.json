  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a young man with short black hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a dark-colored shirt, seated at a table. Positioned centrally in the frame, he occupies the middle ground, with his face and upper body clearly visible. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the man in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field, blurring the foreground and background. To his left and right, other hands holding chopsticks appear intermittently in both the foreground and middle ground, indicating the presence of additional diners who remain partially out of view. These hands move into and out of the frame, picking up the food on the table. The young man is initially looking at the food in front of him, which is being picked up by other hands holding chopsticks. He blinks once and eventually turns his gaze to the left side of the frame, while the other hands continue to pick up food. In the middle ground on the left side, a diner's face is partially visible, but it is not the focus. Two table lamps with white, scalloped shades are situated on either side of the frame, one on the left and one on the right, providing soft illumination. The background consists of a red wall, adding depth to the scene. The setting is dimly lit, with a warm ambiance created by nearby lamps, contributing to the cozy atmosphere. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, maintaining steadiness throughout, keeping the young man as the focal point while subtly capturing the dynamic hand movements around him. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, ensuring consistent spatial framing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
