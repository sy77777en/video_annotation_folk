  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot on a vibrant green soccer pitch during the daytime, under a bright, completely white sky, a white-haired soccer player in a white and black uniform with the number 7 on the back occupies the foreground. His body is angled from the bottom left towards the center of the frame, captured mid-air as he executes a kick with his leg extending upward. The scene is static, with no camera movement, capturing the dynamic moment as he leaps into the frame, contorting his body. In the midground, two players in red and black uniforms react defensively to the kick; one has dark green hair and wears a red harness over his jersey, while the other has dark brown, bowl-cut hair. A fourth player, wearing a white and black uniform similar to the foreground character, is visible behind one of the red-uniformed players, facing another. The perspective is low and tilted, looking across the field towards the action occurring around the midfield. In the background, a white-framed soccer goal with a net stands on the left side of the frame, with the fifth man, the goalkeeper for the red team, positioned nearby. White painted lines, including the penalty arc, are visible on the grass, and several players in different uniforms—some in white and black, others in red and black—are positioned across the pitch in dynamic poses.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
