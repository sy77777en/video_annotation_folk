  "merged_caption": "This eye-level, first-person shot moves forward along a sidewalk, framed by metal scaffolding that stretches from the foreground to the middle ground. The slightly unsteady camera, captured from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, moves forward and pans slightly to the left, featuring mild barrel distortion and using deep focus to keep the entire street scene in sharp view. Initially, a person is positioned in the middle ground on the right, but as the camera advances, they move into the foreground next to a closed security gate. The sidewalk extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, with long shadows stretching across it from left to right. As the camera advances, the scaffolding poles pass by in the foreground, and their long shadows shift across the pavement. To the left, a street is visible, continuing into the background, where pedestrians in casual clothing, such as t-shirts and shorts, cross from left to right at an intersection. A yellow taxi is positioned in the center of the background. In the background, buildings line the far side of the street. A bright sun in the top left creates a lens flare that moves with the camera's forward motion. The scene captures a late afternoon city street, with the sun low in the sky, casting long shadows and creating a significant lens flare. Across the street, which is marked with white painted lines, pedestrians walk past brick buildings, and a yellow taxi can be seen in the distance. The perspective is from beneath metal scaffolding with a corrugated roof that covers a concrete sidewalk, where long shadows are cast by the low sun.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, first-person video is captured from an eye-level, level-angle perspective. The camera moves forward and pans slightly to the left. The shot features mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene in sharp view.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a bustling street scene from a first-person perspective, simulating the experience of walking on the sidewalk under metal scaffolding. The scaffolding, made of metal poles and a corrugated metal roof, casts long shadows across the concrete pavement in the bright sunlight. In the middleground, several pedestrians in casual clothing, such as t-shirts and shorts, are crossing a street at an intersection. A yellow taxi cab is also visible on the street. The sun is low in the sky, creating a significant lens flare.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera moves forward along a sidewalk under metal scaffolding. As the camera advances, the scaffolding poles pass by in the foreground, and their long shadows shift across the pavement. In the middleground, several pedestrians walk across the street at an intersection. A bright lens flare from the sun moves across the screen in sync with the camera's forward motion.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a late afternoon scene on a city street. The perspective is from beneath metal scaffolding with a corrugated roof that covers a concrete sidewalk, where long shadows are cast by the low sun. A bright lens flare from the sun is visible. Across the street, which is marked with white painted lines, pedestrians walk past brick buildings, and a yellow taxi can be seen in the distance. To the right, a person stands near a storefront with its gray, roll-down security gate closed.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
