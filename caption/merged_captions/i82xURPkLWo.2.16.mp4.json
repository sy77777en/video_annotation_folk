  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot, two men are positioned in the center of the frame, embracing in the middle ground. One man, wearing a dark blue shirt and grey pants, has a medium build and a shaved head, displaying a facial expression of joy. The other man, dressed in a maroon shirt and dark pants, has a slightly heavier build and short hair, also showing a happy demeanor. They stand closely together, each with their arms wrapped around the other in a warm embrace, maintaining their hug throughout the video while gently patting each other's backs with their hands, adding to the sense of connection and support. A large tree trunk occupies the foreground on the far left. In the bottom left, a stack of firewood sits in the middle ground, with the front of a truck partially visible just behind it. The background is composed of a grassy area and a dense line of trees, with a prominent palm tree situated in the center of the frame. The scene is set outdoors in a lush, green environment, likely during the day, with tall trees and dense foliage surrounding the area. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, using a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from an eye-level, level angle. It employs a deep focus, resulting in a large depth of field that keeps the two men hugging and the wooded background in focus. The atmosphere is calm and serene, with the embrace adding a sense of warmth and connection to the natural surroundings. A parked vehicle is partially visible, suggesting a rural or suburban setting. The focus remains on the emotional interaction between the two men, highlighting their moment of connection and support.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
