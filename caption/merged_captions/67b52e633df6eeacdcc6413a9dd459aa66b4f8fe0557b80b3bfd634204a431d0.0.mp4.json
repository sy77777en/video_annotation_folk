  "merged_caption": "The video features a full shot of two women on wooden lounge chairs in a beach setting. Initially, the woman on the left, with light skin and long blonde hair, wearing a green bikini and sunglasses, appears in the middleground and then moves into the foreground, positioned in the center left of the frame as the camera arcs around them. The woman on the right, with light skin and medium-length brown hair, wearing a yellow swimsuit and sunglasses, starts in the bottom right but transitions to the center right. Both women are facing each other, suggesting interaction. The camera starts close to the two women and arcs around them in a clockwise direction, capturing their relaxed postures on the lounge chairs. The camera features a high-angle view from eye level, employing deep focus to keep all elements sharp, and maintains a steady and fluid motion. Both women remain mostly still, occasionally shifting their legs, turning their heads, and gesturing with their hands and arms as they converse. The setting is sunny, with beach umbrellas and other lounge chairs nearby, enhancing the beach atmosphere. The environment is bright and sunny, with vibrant sunlight casting distinct shadows on the sand. The lounge chairs are made of dark wood with slatted designs, and some are occupied by individuals relaxing under the sun. In the background, there are beach umbrellas and a few small structures, possibly part of a beachside facility. The background includes a sandy beach, some greenery, and a few boats and umbrellas, indicating a beachside location. The spatial composition changes slightly due to the camera movements, affecting the positioning of the subjects. The scene conveys a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere typical of a beach resort.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
