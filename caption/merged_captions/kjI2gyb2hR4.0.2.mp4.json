  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot features a young Black man with a short, high-top fade hairstyle, positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is wearing a blue denim varsity-style jacket with a striped, ribbed collar over a red shirt, and a pair of headphones with a thin wire rests around his neck. The young man's head is tilted downward as he looks at something just below the frame, slightly furrowing his brow and moving his mouth as he speaks. His head slightly moves as he shakes it. The camera, at eye level and with a level angle, initially tilts slightly upward and pans to the left, then tilts slightly downward to follow the man. In the foreground, the out-of-focus shoulder of a second person frames the right side of the shot. The scene takes place in a dimly lit room with a dark, cluttered background, where the wall behind the subject is adorned with out-of-focus, graffiti-style drawings, one of which resembles a stylized face. The scene is cast in a warm, yellowish-green light, creating a dark atmosphere. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground, and moves smoothly and slowly throughout the shot. To the right, the blurry, out-of-focus shoulder and side of another person are partially visible, framing the right side of the shot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
