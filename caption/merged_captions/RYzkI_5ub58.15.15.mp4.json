  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a natural setting with birds scattered across leafless tree branches and the ground. The birds are predominantly white with some darker markings and vary in size. They are positioned throughout the frame, with some in the foreground on the lower branches and ground, while others are in the middle ground on higher branches. The scene is framed with the dense forest in the background, providing depth. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, capturing the birds at eye level with deep focus and a large depth of field, ensuring the scene is sharp. The camera exhibits smooth, minimal shaking. The birds appear to be at rest, with one bird standing on a tree branch, flapping its wings without taking flight, creating slight movement within the otherwise static scene. The natural light casts soft shadows, highlighting the textures of the tree bark and leaves. The overall composition highlights the interaction between the birds and their environment, with the camera maintaining a consistent level throughout. The environment is filled with tall trees, some with bare branches, and dense foliage in various shades of green. The ground is covered with a mix of grass and underbrush. The birds' positions vary, with some perched on branches in the top left and top right, while others are on the ground in the bottom left and bottom right. There are a few birds standing in the middle of the frame. The scene is tranquil, with a focus on the interaction between the birds and their natural habitat, set in a lush, green forest setting during daylight.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the scene sharply. The camera exhibits smooth, minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of birds perched on and around leafless tree branches. The birds are predominantly white with some darker markings, and they vary in size. They are scattered across the branches, with some standing on the ground below. The scene is set in a natural environment with a dense forest in the background. The birds appear to be at rest, with one bird standing on a tree branch, flapping its wings.",
    "Motion": "A group of birds is perched on branches and the ground. One bird stands on a branch, flapping its wings without taking flight. The other birds remain stationary, either perched or on the ground.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a lush, green forest setting during daylight. The environment is filled with tall trees, some with bare branches, and dense foliage in various shades of green. In the foreground, the trees are rather bare, with no leaves. Birds are perched on these branches or on the ground. One bird is standing on a tree, flapping its wings, and some display white and gray plumage. The ground is covered with a mix of grass and underbrush. The natural light casts soft shadows, highlighting the textures of the tree bark and leaves. The scene is tranquil, with a focus on the interaction between the birds and their natural habitat.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a natural setting with birds scattered across leafless tree branches and the ground. The birds are positioned throughout the frame, with some in the foreground on the lower branches and ground, while others are in the middle ground on higher branches. The scene is framed with the dense forest in the background, providing depth. The camera is at the same height as the subjects, capturing the birds at eye level. The birds' positions vary, with some perched on branches in the top left and top right, while others are on the ground in the bottom left and bottom right. There are a few birds standing in the middle of the frame, with one of them flapping its wings, creating slight movement within the otherwise static scene. The overall composition highlights the interaction between the birds and their environment, with the camera maintaining a consistent level throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
