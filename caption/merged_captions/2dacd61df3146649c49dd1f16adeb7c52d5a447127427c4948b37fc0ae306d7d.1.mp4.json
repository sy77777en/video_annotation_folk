  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned building corridor, capturing the full length and breadth of the hallway. The camera begins at hip level, moving smoothly forward through the dilapidated corridor with yellowish walls covered in graffiti of various colors, including green, black, and purple. As it progresses, the camera elevates to eye level, maintaining a level angle and providing a dynamic perspective throughout the sequence. Initially, a large pile of wooden debris occupies the middle ground, positioned centrally in the lower part of the frame. As the camera moves forward, this debris transitions from the middle ground to the foreground and eventually out of frame. The walls, covered in graffiti, span the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. Large windows line the right side of the frame, extending from the right upper corner of the foreground all the way into the distant background, allowing sunlight to filter in and illuminate the space. Outside the windows, dense green trees are visible in the background, occupying the right side of the frame. The floor, littered with debris and rubble, runs along the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background. As the camera moves forward, the debris and broken structures become more prominent, and the corridor appears to be leading to a brighter area at the end, with a faint light source visible at the far end, positioned at the center of the frame in the background. The camera maintains a steady forward movement with a slight upward motion, keeping all elements consistently framed while gradually revealing more of the corridor's length. The focus remains deep, capturing the details of the graffiti-covered walls and debris, enhancing the exploration of the corridor.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, moving smoothly forward through an abandoned hallway. As it progresses, the camera elevates to eye level, maintaining a level angle. The focus remains deep, capturing the details of the graffiti-covered walls and debris. The movement is steady and fluid, enhancing the exploration of the corridor.",
    "Subject": "The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned building corridor. The focus is on the environment, characterized by decaying walls with peeling paint and graffiti, and a floor littered with debris. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to illuminate the space and reveal overgrown vegetation outside. The atmosphere conveys a sense of neglect and passage of time, emphasizing the scale and condition of the corridor rather than any specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a dilapidated corridor with yellowish walls covered in graffiti and broken windows on the right side, allowing sunlight to filter in. The floor is littered with debris and rubble, and the walls are in a state of disrepair. As the camera moves forward, the debris and broken structures become more prominent, and the corridor appears to be leading to a brighter area at the end.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone begins by noting a large pile of wooden debris obstructing the path, which the drone subsequently flies over. The footage reveals a long, dilapidated hallway inside an abandoned building. The walls are covered in graffiti of various colors, including green, black, and purple. Debris, consisting of broken wood and concrete, litters the floor. A row of large windows lines the right side of the hallway, offering a view of dense green trees outside. The hallway stretches into the distance, with a faint light visible at the far end.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
