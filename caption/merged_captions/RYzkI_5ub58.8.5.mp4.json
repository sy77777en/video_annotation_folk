  "merged_caption": "A woolly monkey is captured in a medium shot, positioned in the center-left of the foreground against a textured, gray-green rock wall that extends from the foreground to the background. The monkey is shown in profile, facing toward the right. It has thick, dense fur that is a coppery-brown color on its back and shoulders, while its head, face, and hands are covered in black fur. Initially, the primate sits with its mouth chewing, tilting its head slightly upwards. The camera remains static and positioned at the monkey's level throughout the action, using a shallow depth of field to keep the monkey in focus. The shot is slightly unsteady. The monkey then lowers its head, directing its gaze downward toward its hand, which is positioned lower in the frame. It examines a small, light-colored piece of food held in its hand before placing the food in its mouth.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
