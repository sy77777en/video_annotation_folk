  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective on a sidewalk, which extends from the bottom foreground to the background. The camera, slightly unsteady, moves forward along the city sidewalk while slowly panning to the right, altering the composition. Initially, a modern building with dark, slatted panels at its base is prominent in the left foreground and middle ground, while a multi-lane road with light traffic, including a blue compact car, a dark bus, and a silver van, stretches from the foreground to the background, filling the center and right. The road is lined with green belts with trees and lampposts on both sides. In the background, a tall, beige hotel with a red star logo stands on the right, under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds at the top of the frame. As the camera pans right, the building on the left recedes, and the focus shifts towards the road and the buildings on the opposite side. The hotel on the right moves more towards the center of the frame, and a convenience store next to it becomes visible in the right background. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the background clear. The moving perspective captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment, focusing on the peaceful, orderly rhythm of city life rather than any specific entity. A few pedestrians walk on the sidewalk in the distance, contributing to the dynamic cityscape scenery shot of a wide, sunlit street in a modern Japanese city.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot that moves forward along a city sidewalk while panning right to show the street. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the background clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of a wide, sunlit street in a modern Japanese city. The camera moves forward while simultaneously panning to the right, offering a view from a clean, tiled sidewalk down a multi-lane road where traffic, including a blue compact car and a silver van, flows smoothly. The street is lined with contemporary buildings, most notably a tall, beige hotel on the right, and is separated by a median strip with green trees under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The moving perspective captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment, focusing on the peaceful, orderly rhythm of city life rather than any specific entity.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide shot of a modern city street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The scene features clean sidewalks, contemporary buildings, and a multi-lane road lined with trees. There is light traffic on the road and a few pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a wide city street in Japan on a sunny day. The perspective is from a broad sidewalk paved with gray and white checkered tiles and a yellow tactile strip. To the left, a modern building features dark, slatted panels at its base. Across the multi-lane asphalt road, traffic, including cars, vans, and a bus, moves along the street. Green belts with trees and lampposts run along both sides of the road. The opposite side of the road is lined with buildings, including a tall, light-yellow hotel with a red star logo. The scene is set under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds, and a few pedestrians walk on the sidewalk in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
