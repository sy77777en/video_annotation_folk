  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot, with the kayaker and their bright green kayak slightly to the right in the middle ground. The kayaker, wearing a red and yellow long-sleeved top with three white stripes on the sleeves and a white helmet, is framed by dark, rocky walls on both sides within a narrow, rocky gorge. As the kayak goes over the powerful waterfall, the camera, mounted on the front, plunges downward, leading the kayaker from the front and exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The shot begins with a high-angle, overhead view and cranes down to a level, above-water perspective as the kayaker descends. The kayaker grips the paddle with both hands on his right side as he tips forward and plunges vertically down the waterfall. During the fall, the camera shakes intensely and rolls, capturing the descent. Initially, the shot is filled with splashing white water in the foreground, obscuring all elements. Upon reaching the bottom, the kayaker and the camera are engulfed by the turbulent, splashing white water, briefly capturing the kayaker again amidst the chaos. As the scene transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level, the kayaker becomes visible again, centered and much closer to the camera, surrounded by churning water. The rocky wall on the left is now visible, while the right wall is obscured. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, and the view is then immediately obscured by a massive splash of churning white water as it goes over the falls, surrounded by dark, moss-covered rock walls.",

    "Camera": "This selfie-style video, captured from a paddle-mounted camera, leads the kayaker from the front and exhibits mild barrel distortion. The shot begins with a high-angle, overhead view and cranes down to a level, above-water perspective as the kayaker descends a waterfall. During the fall, the camera shakes intensely and rolls. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person wearing a white helmet and a red and yellow long-sleeved top with three white stripes on the sleeves is shown from a high-angle perspective in a bright green kayak. The kayaker is leaning forward, holding a paddle, as they go over a waterfall, and are then completely engulfed by the splashing white water.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle, locked-on perspective, a kayaker in a green kayak grips the paddle with both hands on his right side as he tips forward and plunges vertically down a waterfall. Upon reaching the bottom, the kayaker and the camera are engulfed by the turbulent, splashing white water, briefly capturing the kayaker again amidst the chaos.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted to the front of a bright green kayak, the scene captures the descent down a powerful waterfall within a narrow, rocky gorge. The kayaker, wearing a red and yellow jacket and a white helmet, is seen at the precipice before the kayak plunges forward. The view is then immediately obscured by a massive splash of churning white water as it goes over the falls, surrounded by dark, moss-covered rock walls.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot, with the kayaker and their green kayak slightly to the right in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark, rocky walls on both sides.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
