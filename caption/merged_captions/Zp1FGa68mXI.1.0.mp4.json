  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot where a single, bright red raspberry, slightly shriveled and dehydrated, is the central subject, positioned in the middle of the frame in the foreground on a plain white surface. The raspberry has a bumpy texture composed of many small drupelets and a hollow center. Several small, black ants with segmented bodies, six legs, and long antennae are initially seen crawling on and around the raspberry. As the time-lapse progresses, these ants rapidly swarm over and around the fruit, crawling frantically across it and the surrounding surface, breaking off small red particles and carrying them away. The raspberry is visibly consumed and broken down, while the number of red crumbs scattered around it increases. The ants move quickly around the central fruit before gradually leaving the frame, with most gone by the end of the clip. The raspberry itself remains stationary throughout the process. The video is captured from a high angle, employing an extremely shallow depth of field with the focus set on the raspberry in the foreground. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the raspberry throughout the shot. Text overlays include a time counter in the bottom left corner that progresses from \"74 HOURS\" to \"83 HOURS,\" with \"3 DAYS\" written underneath, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" in the bottom right corner, and a black, stylized eye logo in the top right corner. The scene is presented as a time-lapse in an indoor setting, with red crumbs and particles, presumably from the raspberry, scattered on the white surface around it.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of this time-lapse video is a single, bright red raspberry, which appears slightly shriveled and dehydrated, resting on a white surface. The raspberry has a bumpy texture composed of many small drupelets and a hollow center. Several small, black ants, the secondary subjects, are seen crawling on and around the fruit. These ants have segmented bodies, six legs, and long antennae. Red crumbs and particles, presumably from the raspberry, are scattered on the white surface around it. A text overlay in the lower-left corner displays a counter that progresses from \"74 HOURS\" to \"83 HOURS,\" along with the text \"3 DAYS.\" In the lower right, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" is visible, and a black, stylized eye logo is in the upper-right corner.",
    "Motion": "In this time-lapse video, several small black ants rapidly swarm over and around a single red raspberry. The ants crawl frantically across the fruit and the surrounding white surface, breaking off small red particles and carrying them away. As the ants work, the raspberry is visibly consumed and broken down, while the number of red crumbs scattered around it increases. The raspberry itself remains stationary throughout the process.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting, a single, bright red raspberry rests on a plain white surface, which is scattered with small red crumbs. Several small, dark ants crawl over and around the fruit. The scene is presented as a time-lapse. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a counter in white text that progresses from \"75 HOURS\" onward, with \"3 DAYS\" written underneath. In the bottom right corner, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" is overlaid in a white, stylized font, and a black and white eye icon is overlaid in the top right corner.",
    "Spatial": "This is a full shot where a single raspberry is the central subject, positioned in the middle of the frame in the foreground on a white surface. Several ants are initially seen crawling on and around the raspberry. As the time-lapse progresses, the ants move quickly around the central fruit before gradually leaving the frame, with most gone by the end of the clip. Red crumbs are scattered on the surface surrounding the raspberry. Text overlays include a time counter in the bottom left, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" in the bottom right, and a logo in the top right. The camera gradually zooms in on the raspberry throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
