  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a young man of East Asian descent with short, bleached blonde hair and small hoop earrings in each ear is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is in sharp focus as he initially looks slightly to his right, then turns his head to face forward, slightly turning his head toward the camera's perspective. His mouth moves as he speaks to another person who is out of focus in the foreground. The out-of-focus back and shoulder of this second person, wearing a light blue top with a collar, occupy the right side of the frame. The setting is a dimly lit, dark environment, with focused, low-key lighting illuminating the speaker's face, while the background is indistinct and shrouded in shadow. The camera remains static, positioned at the subjects' eye level, and uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man with blonde hair in the midground in sharp focus.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man with blonde hair in the midground in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A young man of East Asian descent with short, bleached blonde hair is shown in a close-up view, looking initially to the left of the frame before turning to face the person in front of him. He has dark eyes and wears small hoop earrings in both ears. His mouth is moving as he speaks. In the foreground and out of focus is the back of another person's head and shoulder. This second person is wearing a light blue top with a collar and is being addressed by the first man.",
    "Motion": "A young man with bleached blonde hair, initially looking slightly to his right, turns his head to face forward. His mouth moves as he speaks to another person who is out of focus in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is a dimly lit, dark environment. A young man with short, bleached-blonde hair and small hoop earrings in each ear is in focus, speaking to the individual whose back is to the camera. The focused, low-key lighting illuminates the speaker's face, while the background is indistinct and shrouded in shadow.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a man with blonde hair is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is in sharp focus as he speaks, slightly turning his head toward the camera's perspective. Occupying the right side of the frame, the out-of-focus back and shoulder of a second person are visible in the foreground. The background is dark and indistinct.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
