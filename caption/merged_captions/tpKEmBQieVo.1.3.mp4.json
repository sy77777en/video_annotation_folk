  "merged_caption": "The video captures a thrilling perspective from a camera mounted on the back of a person in a yellow and black wingsuit with a hint of blue. As the sole figure in the frame, he soars through the air, gliding through a wide, green valley flanked by steep, rocky mountains under a clear blue sky. The arms of the person in the wingsuit are visible in the foreground, enhancing the sense of immersion. Far below in the middle ground to the left, a small town with red-roofed buildings and green fields is visible, bisected by a road, adding depth to the breathtaking aerial view. The sun is bright, casting a large shadow from one of the mountains across the valley. The dynamic movement of the camera with the wingsuit flyer creates an exhilarating sense of speed as the background scenery rushes past. The camera, initially level, maintains a deep focus and shifts to a high angle as it quickly tilts up and then down near the end of the shot. As the video progresses, the person deploys their parachute, which emerges as a crumpled bundle of white and light blue fabric and begins to unfurl and inflate into a canopy in the center of the view under the tension of the lines. This unsteady aerial shot captures the wingsuit flyer moving through the mountain valley, with the camera fixed on the individual, creating the impression of leading him through the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video shows an individual in a yellow and black wingsuit with a hint of blue, captured by a camera that follows their movement. The person is the sole focus of the frame. As the video progresses, a parachute deploys, appearing as a crumpled bundle of white and light blue fabric that begins to unfurl in the center of the view under the tension of the lines.",
    "Motion": "A camera fixed on an individual captures a person in a yellow and black wingsuit gliding through a mountain valley. The person deploys their parachute, which emerges as a crumpled bundle of white and light blue fabric and begins to unfurl and inflate.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, captures a flight through a wide, green valley flanked by steep, rocky mountains under a clear blue sky. From this perspective, the arms of a person in a yellow and black wingsuit are visible in the foreground. Below, a small town with red-roofed buildings and green fields is visible, bisected by a road. The sun is bright, casting a large shadow from one of the mountains across the valley.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a thrilling perspective from a camera mounted on the back of a person in a yellow and black wingsuit. As the sole figure in the frame, he soars through the air and deploys his parachute, which unfurls into a canopy. The scene unfolds within a deep valley, flanked by large, rocky mountains on both sides. Far below in the middle ground to the left, a town and green fields are visible, adding depth to the breathtaking aerial view. The dynamic movement of the camera with the wingsuit flyer creates an exhilarating sense of speed as the background scenery rushes past."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
