  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, wearing a black top. Her expression is serious and focused. Initially, the image is out of focus, but it quickly transitions to a clear view as the camera performs a rack focus to bring the woman in the foreground into focus. The woman is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, while the background remains softly blurred, suggesting an open space, possibly near a body of water or an expansive landscape. Her face is directly facing the camera, with her head slightly tilted upward. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle and tilts up slightly and smoothly. The lighting enhances all of her facial features, providing a balanced emphasis on her eyes, lips, and overall visage, with a soft, diffused quality that suggests overcast or gentle sunlight. The woman lifts her head and looks directly at the camera, maintaining a serious expression throughout the sequence, and her posture remains upright and composed. The lighting indicates daytime, and the scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the woman's presence through the sharp detail against the indistinct backdrop, creating a contrast between her clarity and the soft, ambient environment. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing consistently emphasizes the woman's face against the indistinct backdrop. The lighting highlights her features, maintaining a consistent focus on her expression.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle. It begins out of focus with an extremely shallow depth of field, then performs a rack focus to bring the woman in the foreground into focus. The camera tilts up slightly and smoothly.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, wearing a black top. Her expression is serious and focused. She is centrally positioned and facing forward, with a clear and direct gaze. The lighting enhances all of her facial features, providing a balanced emphasis on her eyes, lips, and overall visage.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a blurry image of a woman, which gradually becomes clearer as she lifts her head and looks directly at the camera. The background is a soft, out-of-focus outdoor setting, suggesting a calm and serene environment. The woman maintains a serious expression throughout the sequence, and her posture remains upright and composed.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with an outdoor setting featuring a neutral, muted color palette. Initially, the shot is out of focus, gradually transitioning to a clear focus on a woman prominently positioned in the foreground. The softly blurred background suggests an open space, possibly near a body of water or an expansive landscape. The lighting indicates daytime, with a soft, diffused quality that suggests overcast or gentle sunlight. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the woman's presence through the sharp detail against the indistinct backdrop, creating a contrast between her clarity and the soft, ambient environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman, capturing her from the shoulders up. Initially, the image is out of focus, but it quickly transitions to a clear view. The woman is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, while the background remains softly blurred. Her face is directly facing the camera, with her head slightly tilted upward. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing consistently emphasizes the woman's face against the indistinct backdrop. The lighting highlights her features, maintaining a consistent focus on her expression."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
