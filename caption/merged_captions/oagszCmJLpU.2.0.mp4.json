  "merged_caption": "This scenery video is presented as an extreme wide shot from a low-angle perspective, capturing a dramatic weather event. A vast prairie of green and yellow-brown grass occupies the bottom portion of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background horizon. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm system with dark gray and black clouds swirling, situated in both the middle ground and background. Several distinct columns of heavy rain, or rain shafts, fall from the base of the clouds in the center, as well as on the left and right of the frame, connecting the ominous sky to the distant landscape. A faint, light-colored road winds through the prairie in the distance. The camera captures this scene in a time-lapse format from a low-angle perspective above ground level, somewhere between eye-level and overhead. It pans slowly and smoothly to the right, revealing the turbulent clouds and rain shafts in greater detail across the frame, with a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape and the sky in sharp detail. There is no main subject, as the video's focus is on conveying the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the storm over the expansive natural environment.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event. A massive, turbulent system of dark grey storm clouds dominates the sky, hanging low over a vast, open plain of green and yellow grasslands. Distinct columns of heavy rain, or rain shafts, can be seen falling from the base of the clouds, connecting the ominous sky to the distant horizon. There is no main subject, as the video's focus is on conveying the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the storm over the expansive natural environment.",
    "Motion": "This video is a dramatic scenery shot of a massive storm system. Dark, turbulent clouds loom over a vast, open grassland. Columns of heavy rain are visible falling in the distance.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, a vast, open prairie of green and yellow-brown grass stretches to the horizon. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm system with dark gray and black clouds swirling. Below the dark base of the clouds, several distinct shafts of heavy rain are visible, falling onto the distant landscape. A faint, light-colored road winds through the prairie in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery video is presented as an extreme wide shot from a low-angle perspective. A vast prairie occupies the bottom portion of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background horizon. A massive storm cloud system dominates the top and center of the frame, situated in both the middle ground and background. Several distinct rain shafts fall from the base of the clouds in the center, as well as on the left and right of the frame, connecting the sky to the land in the background. The camera slowly pans from left to right, revealing the turbulent clouds and rain shafts in greater detail across the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
