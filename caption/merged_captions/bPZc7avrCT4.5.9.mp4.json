  "merged_caption": "In this full shot, a vibrant green, semi-opaque water balloon with a glossy surface rests in the center of the frame on the flat top of a light-brown tree stump located in the foreground. The balloon is oblong, and its tied-off opening is visible at the bottom. The background, which is out of focus, features green foliage and a pile of cut logs on the left. A bright blue, terry cloth towel enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center, striking the stationary green water balloon. Captured from a static, hip-level camera with a level angle, the shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the green water balloon in the foreground as it is popped. In slow motion, the balloon instantly ruptures at the point of impact, causing the water inside to erupt outwards in a wide, misty spray. The water explodes outwards from the center across the frame, with fragments of the green balloon and a piece of the blue towel visible within the splashing water as it erupts. The torn green rubber of the balloon is propelled away by the force of the expanding water, with the fragments pushed toward the left and bottom, while the blue towel remains on the right side, partially obscured by the water spray.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a static, hip-level camera with a level angle. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the green water balloon in the foreground as it is popped.",
    "Subject": "A vibrant green, semi-opaque water balloon with a glossy surface rests on the flat top of a light-brown tree stump. The balloon is oblong, and its tied-off opening is visible at the bottom. A bright blue, terry cloth towel enters from the right and strikes the balloon, causing it to burst. The impact results in a dramatic, slow-motion explosion of water, which sprays outwards in a wide, misty cloud. Fragments of the green balloon and a piece of the blue towel are visible within the splashing water as it erupts.",
    "Motion": "A blue towel is swung into the frame from the right and strikes a stationary green water balloon resting on a tree stump. In slow motion, the balloon instantly ruptures at the point of impact, causing the water inside to erupt outwards in a wide, misty spray. The torn green rubber of the balloon is propelled away by the force of the expanding water.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit outdoor setting, a single green water balloon rests on the flat top of a wooden tree stump. The background, which is out of focus, features green foliage and a pile of cut logs. A blue, textured object enters from the right and strikes the balloon, causing it to rupture in slow motion. Water erupts from the point of impact in a wide spray of droplets as the green rubber of the balloon tears apart.",
    "Spatial": "In this full shot, a green water balloon rests in the center of the frame on a tree stump located in the foreground. The background contains a pile of logs on the left and green foliage, all of which are out of focus. A blue towel enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center, striking the balloon. The balloon bursts in slow motion, with water exploding outwards from the center across the frame. The green balloon fragments are pushed toward the left and bottom, while the blue towel remains on the right side, partially obscured by the water spray. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
