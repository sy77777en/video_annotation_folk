  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. In the foreground, on the left side, a silver car drives out of the frame, followed by a light blue car with a visible license plate. Pedestrians, including men and women in casual attire and face masks, walk along the sidewalks on both sides, occupying the foreground and middle ground. A red vending machine is positioned near a shop entrance in the center at the beginning and on the right as the camera moves, consistently in the middle ground. Traditional-style buildings line the street in both the middle ground and background, with some people standing near a shop entrance. As the scene progresses, a silver car with a visible license plate drives down the street from the right to the left, while a black and white car moves in the opposite direction. The camera is positioned at the height of the pedestrians, maintaining a consistent view of the lively street dynamics. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward smoothly while panning left, focusing on the street and pedestrians, then continues straight ahead with minimal shaking. People walk along a street lined with shops and trees, some strolling in pairs, while others walk alone, all moving at a leisurely pace. The video presents a first-person point of view, capturing a lively street scene in a quaint outdoor setting. The time of day is likely afternoon, with a clear sky and scattered clouds. The environment features traditional Japanese architecture, with wooden buildings lining the street, some displaying signs and banners. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, and the overall atmosphere is vibrant and dynamic, with people moving about and vehicles passing by.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
