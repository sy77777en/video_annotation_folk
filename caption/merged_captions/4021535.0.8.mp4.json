  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a central cluster of clear granules and small, reddish-brown ants occupies the middle ground and center of the frame. The ants are in constant motion, crawling over and around the granules, which are scattered on a flat, blue-grey surface that serves as the background. A few cracks are visible on this surface, particularly in the top right. The video begins with a noticeably unsteady camera, exhibiting random motion without a clear pattern. Captured from a high, ground-level angle, the shot uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the textured, light blue surface marked with a few cracks. The background is clear, but most of the scene appears blurred. The focus quickly shifts to reveal a group of small, reddish-brown ants swarming over a pile of clear, crystalline granules, actively moving around and on top of the scattered cluster. The ants continuously crawl in various directions, moving through the pile and interacting with the individual crystals as they mill about. The camera, positioned above the subjects and looking down, exhibits a shake.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
