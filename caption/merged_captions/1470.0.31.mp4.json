  "merged_caption": "The video is a medium shot of a young, light-skinned man with medium-length, reddish-brown hair, depicted from the waist up, positioned slightly left of center in the frame and in the middle ground. He is looking downwards and slightly to his right, with his mouth open, suggesting he is speaking to someone or something below him. His expression and posture indicate he is engaged in a conversation, possibly explaining or discussing something. He has white foam or suds arranged on his hair like a cap, and more foam on his chin and upper lip, resembling a beard and mustache. He wears a white, short-sleeved collared shirt and a dark tie with lighter diagonal stripes. In his right hand, he holds a dark-covered book with the title \"Virgils Chronicle\" printed in gold foil lettering, which is also in the center-left middle ground. A blurred pink shower cap, featuring a white button in the center, sways side to side in the bottom right foreground, indicating that the person he is addressing is likely in a bathtub or shower. The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a bathroom, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. A light-colored shower curtain with a green and white leaf or feather-like pattern is visible in the background, slightly to the right of center, and a plain, light, possibly beige or off-white wall is to the left. The camera is positioned at hip level, looking up from a low angle at the person, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It exhibits minor, very smooth movement as it gradually zooms in on the man, with diffuse lighting illuminating the scene from above and slightly to the side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
