  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a stable wide shot, initially capturing a man in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of center, walking towards the camera along a wooden path that stretches from the bottom center foreground into the center background. The man, wearing a black shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows and dark pants, has a medium build and a beard, and walks with a relaxed posture. A white dog, a medium-sized breed, follows him closely, also starting in the middle ground, centered on the path. The path is covered with fallen autumn leaves, creating a natural, earthy texture, and is surrounded by tall trees with a mix of green and golden leaves, indicating a transition into fall. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled light on the ground and contributing to the serene and picturesque setting. The camera is shot at ground level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. Trees frame the scene on the left and right, extending from the middle ground into the background. The man moves towards the foreground and exits the frame at the bottom left, while the dog continues towards the camera, briefly filling the foreground before also exiting past the camera on the left. The frame is then left focused on the leaf-covered path receding into the sunlit forest background, capturing a serene moment in the forest and emphasizing the companionship between the man and the dog. The atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible weather disturbances, maintaining focus on the path and the surrounding foliage, emphasizing the tranquil forest environment.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a forest during the daytime, with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting dappled light on the ground. The setting features a wooden path covered with fallen autumn leaves, creating a natural, earthy texture. Tall trees with a mix of green and golden leaves surround the path, indicating a transition into fall. The atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible weather disturbances.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
