  "merged_caption": "The video uses a medium close-up shot, framing two women from the chest up and placing them side by side in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The woman on the left, with pronounced dark eyebrows and deep-set eyes, is positioned slightly left of center, while the woman on the right, with delicate facial features and wide eyes, is just right of center. Both women are wearing dark, loose-fitting garments and head coverings that drape over their hair and shoulders, facing slightly toward the camera and each other. The woman on the left puts her hand above her chest, near her neck, and looks slightly upward, seeming to be saying something and moves her hand nervously. The woman on the right leans gently toward the woman on the left and looks up to their front, staying close and attentive. A third element, a hand with light skin and long fingers, enters from the center-bottom left foreground and moves upward toward the center, brushing the air in front of the woman on the left. The background is dark and undefined, keeping the focus on the women and the hand. The scene takes place indoors in a dimly lit environment with a dark, undefined background that creates a sense of enclosure. The lighting is stark, casting deep shadows and highlighting the contours of the faces and fabric, contributing to a dramatic visual effect. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, with no noticeable change in height or angle, and the shot is static but slightly unsteady. The low resolution of the video makes the focus difficult to determine. The overall focus remains on the two women and the reaching hand, with their close proximity and attentive postures suggesting a shared moment of concern or attention.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, slightly unsteady shot filmed from a level angle, eye level. The low resolution of the video makes the focus difficult to determine.",
    "Subject": "The video features two women with light skin, both wearing dark, loose-fitting garments and head coverings that drape over their hair and shoulders. The woman on the left has pronounced dark eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a somber expression, with her hand raised to her chest in one moment and her gaze directed slightly upward. The woman on the right, positioned closely beside her, has similarly styled clothing and head covering, with delicate facial features and wide eyes, and she leans gently toward the woman on the left, looking up with a concerned or attentive expression. A third subject, a hand with light skin and long fingers, appears in the foreground, from left bottom to top-center, brushing the air in front of the woman on the left. The overall focus remains on the two women and the reaching hand, with their close proximity and attentive postures suggesting a shared moment of concern or attention.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a dimly lit environment with a dark, undefined background that creates a sense of enclosure. Two individuals are positioned close together in the middleground, both draped in dark, textured fabric that covers their heads and shoulders, with the material appearing matte and heavy. Their garments are simple, lacking visible patterns or embellishments, and the overall color palette is monochromatic, dominated by shades of black, gray, and white. One person is seen with a hand raised to their chest, while another hand, belonging to a third figure outside the main group, extends into the scene from the left foreground, partially visible and pale against the dark backdrop. The lighting is stark, casting deep shadows and highlighting the contours of the faces and fabric, contributing to a dramatic visual effect. There are no visible overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a medium close-up shot, framing two women from the chest up and placing them side by side in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The woman on the left is positioned slightly left of center, while the woman on the right is just right of center, both facing slightly toward the camera and each other. A third element, a hand, enters from the center-bottom left foreground and moves upward toward the center, briefly overlapping the space in front of the woman on the left. The background is dark and undefined, keeping the focus on the women and the hand. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, with no noticeable change in height or angle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
