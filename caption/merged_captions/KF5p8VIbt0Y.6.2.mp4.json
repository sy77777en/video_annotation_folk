  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of illuminated neon signage advertising a \"Floor Show,\" occupying most of the frame and positioned centrally in the foreground. The illuminated letters and decorative bulbs are clearly visible against a dark, rainy urban backdrop. The camera, placed at a height slightly above the sign, moves forward through the neon letters, smoothly passing through them. As it transitions its focus to a glass skylight behind the sign, the camera tilts and moves downward, adopting a high-angle perspective that looks through the skylight to the scene below. The skylight initially occupies the center-bottom of the frame in the foreground, gradually fills the entire frame, and remains in the foreground. The scene below the skylight shows several tables and a light-haired woman sitting by one of them. The overall style is monochromatic, with high contrast between the bright neon lights and the surrounding darkness, and the bright inside of the skylight and the surrounding darkness. The rain creates a textured, misty effect across the scene, with water streaks visible as diagonal lines. The camera, from an overhead level, level-angle perspective, slightly unsteady, focus-tracks the illuminated sign before shifting focus to the skylight. The shot concludes with a rack focus that gradually blurs the entire image, effectively transitioning out of the shot while maintaining the skylight and the rain in the foreground as the primary elements, with the background becoming indistinct. No major human subjects are present; the focus remains on the spatial arrangement and movement between the neon sign and the skylight within the urban night setting. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead level, level-angle perspective, the slightly unsteady camera moves forward, focus-tracking an illuminated sign. The camera passes through the sign, then tilts and moves downward, and the focus shifts to a glass skylight behind it, adopting a high-angle view that looks through the skylight to the scene below, before a rack focus blurs the image to transition out of the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up shot of illuminated neon signage at night, capturing the glowing letters and decorative lights against a dark, rainy urban backdrop. The camera initially moves through the neon sign and then shifts its focus to a glass skylight positioned behind and below the sign. Adopting a high-angle perspective, it looks through the skylight to capture the scene below, which shows several tables and a light-haired woman sitting by one of them. The video concludes with a rack focus that artfully blurs the image, transitioning smoothly out of the shot.",
    "Motion": "The video features a neon sign advertising a \"Floor Show\" as the camera smoothly passes through it, then tilts and moves downward. The focus transitions to a glass skylight behind the sign, adopting a high-angle perspective that looks through the skylight to the scene below. A rack focus is then used to blur the image, effectively transitioning out of the shot.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor urban environment at night, featuring illuminated neon signage with bold, curved letters in white and outlined bulbs, suspended against a dark backdrop. The camera gradually moves and transitions to focus on a glass skylight behind the signage under heavy rain, with water streaks visible as diagonal lines. The overall style is monochromatic, with high contrast between the bright neon lights and the surrounding darkness, and the bright inside of the skylight and the surrounding darkness. The rain creates a textured, misty effect across the scene. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of neon signage occupying most of the frame, positioned centrally in the foreground, with the illuminated letters and decorative bulbs clearly visible against a dark, rainy background. The camera, placed at a height slightly above the sign, moves forward through the neon letters, transitioning its focus to a glass skylight. After the camera crosses the signage, the skylight initially occupies the center-bottom of the frame in the foreground, gradually fills the entire frame, and remains in the foreground. The camera adopts a high-angle perspective, looking down through the skylight. The shot concludes with a rack focus that gradually blurs the entire image, maintaining the skylight and the rain in the foreground as the primary elements while the background becomes indistinct.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
