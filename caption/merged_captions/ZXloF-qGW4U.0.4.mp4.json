  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a person with a light skin tone, dressed entirely in black and wearing a hooded garment that conceals their head and the lower half of their face, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground of a long, narrow corridor illuminated entirely by a saturated red light. The corridor's walls, featuring a repeating pattern of textured, recessed squares and vertical, glowing red light strips, extend from the foreground to the background on the left and right sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth. As the person, whose dark eyes are visible, walks forward toward the camera, their eyes shift from side to side. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, smoothly moves backward, maintaining the medium shot framing and keeping the subject centered while utilizing a deep focus to keep both the figure and the red-lit hallway in sharp detail. This movement makes the hallway appear to stretch as the person advances. In the middle of the video, another person emerges from a doorway on the left side of the corridor in the middle ground.",
  "input_captions": {
    "Camera": "From a level, eye-level perspective, the camera smoothly moves backward, leading a person in a black hood who is walking toward it. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping both the figure and the red-lit hallway in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A person with a light skin tone is dressed entirely in black, wearing a hooded garment that covers their head, making it difficult to determine their hair length or color. The garment, which appears to be a loose-fitting cloak or robe, conceals the lower half of their face, leaving only their dark eyes visible. Initially, they maintain a direct gaze, but then their eyes shift to glance left and right.",
    "Motion": "A person walks forward through a narrow, red-lit corridor. As they advance, the camera moves backward, making the hallway appear to stretch. The person's eyes shift from side to side while they continue their forward movement.",
    "Scene": "A figure in a dark, hooded garment walks through a long, narrow corridor illuminated entirely by a saturated red light. The walls on both sides are covered in a repeating pattern of textured, recessed squares. Numerous vertical, glowing red light strips are embedded at intervals along the walls, accentuating the length of the hallway as the person moves forward.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground of a long, red-lit corridor. The corridor's walls, featuring vertical red light strips, extend from the foreground to the background on the left and right sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth. As the person walks forward towards the camera, the camera simultaneously tracks backward, keeping the subject centered and maintaining the medium shot framing throughout the clip. In the middle of the video, another person emerges from a doorway on the left side of the corridor in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
