  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is initially framed by a dark doorway on the left, looking out into a dimly lit outdoor area in the middle ground. A heads-up display is positioned in the bottom right, showing a weapon icon and ammunition count. The camera, from an unsteady, eye-level perspective, peeks from behind a building and moves quickly to the left, then slowly pushes forward and pans slightly to the right while zooming in, gradually revealing more of the scene. This movement centers on the middle ground, where the rear of a dark gray car, a brick wall, and a planter with foliage are visible. Bright light is cast from the right onto this area, while the background shows a faintly visible, dimly lit forest. The view then zooms in, bringing a rifle's sight into focus on the car visible in the distance, before zooming back out and remaining stationary after aiming. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus. During this movement, a small white reticle is in the center of the screen, and a \"Mount\" prompt appears. Red subtitle text reads \"AI-Qatala Fighter 2:\" followed by the phrase \"I am going to beat you to death even after you give me the location!\" in white text as overlays at the bottom. The video is shown from the first-person perspective of a video game character in a dark environment, holding a rifle visible at the bottom of the screen along with a heads-up display showing the ammunition count. The view is from inside a building, looking out through a doorway into a dark, outdoor area at night.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks from a dark interior through an open doorway into a dimly lit outdoor area at night. The view, which quickly zooms in, is framed by the dark doorway and focuses on the rear of a dark gray car. To the left, a brick wall and a planter with foliage are visible. A heads-up display (HUD) is present as an overlay in the bottom right, showing a weapon icon and ammunition count. A small white reticle is in the center of the screen, and later, a \"Mount\" prompt appears. Red subtitle text reads \"AI-Qatala Fighter 2:\" followed by the phrase \"I am going to beat you to death even after you give me the location!\" in white text as overlays at the bottom.",

A heads-up display is positioned in the bottom right. The camera slowly pushes forward and pans slightly to the right while zooming in, gradually revealing more of the scene. This movement centers on the middle ground, where the rear of a light-colored car, a brick wall, and a planter are visible. Bright light is cast from the right onto this area, while the background shows a faintly visible, dimly lit forest. During this movement, a \"Mount\" prompt and red and white subtitle text appear as overlays at the bottom of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
