  "merged_caption": "Initially, the scene is captured in a full shot, with a man with dark skin standing on a chair positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt with a small, colorful graphic on the chest and light-colored, loose-fitting pants. A thin vertical line bisects the entire frame from top to bottom. In the foreground, the arm of a seated person is visible in the bottom left, and a round table with a reflective surface and a metallic frame is positioned at the bottom center of the frame. A stream of fire originates from near the man's left hand and arcs down toward the table. In the background, a door and a blue painting are visible on the left wall. The video takes place indoors in a room with white walls and a black-and-white checkered tile floor. The ceiling is a pale blue, and the space is sparsely furnished, featuring some metal chairs with a simple, functional design. The lighting is even, and the environment has a clean, geometric appearance with sharp lines and right angles. The shot begins at a low-angle, hip-level and cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a high-angle, eye-level looking down. The camera shakes noticeably throughout the movement. As the camera cranes upward, following the trajectory of the fire, the man's head moves out of the frame, leaving only his torso and legs visible. Consequently, the black-and-white checkered floor becomes the dominant visual element in the background, and the table is repositioned to the center with several chairs becoming visible around it. A deep focus is used, keeping a large depth of field.",

    "Subject": "A man with dark skin stands in the center-right of the view, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt with a small, colorful graphic on the chest and light-colored, loose-fitting pants. He is performing an act of fire-making, with a stream of fire arcing from near his left hand downwards. As the video progresses, the camera cranes upward, causing the man's head to move out of the frame, leaving his torso and legs visible. Meanwhile, the arm and hand of a second person, who appears to be seated, are consistently visible in the bottom left corner.",
    "Motion": "A man directs a stream of fire in a downward arc toward other people seated in front of him. The camera cranes up, following the trajectory of the fire. As the camera moves, the man's head moves out of the frame, while the arm of a second person in the foreground remains still initially and is in the middle ground at the end.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a room with white walls and a black-and-white checkered tile floor. The ceiling is a pale blue, and the space is sparsely furnished, featuring a round table with a reflective surface and a metallic frame, as well as some metal chairs with a simple, functional design. The lighting is even, and the environment has a clean, geometric appearance with sharp lines and right angles. A person is present, standing on a chair near the table, dressed in light-colored clothing that contrasts with the patterned floor. Another person is partially visible, sitting in another chair also near the table. There is a thin vertical line bisecting the view and a subtle orange spark-like visual near the center, which are part of the physical scene. The scene is framed on both sides by shaking black borders.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, the scene is captured in a full shot, with a man standing on a chair positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A thin vertical line bisects the entire frame from top to bottom. In the foreground, the arm of a seated person is visible in the bottom left, and a round table is positioned at the bottom center of the frame. A stream of fire originates from the man in the middle ground and arcs down toward the table. In the background, a door and a blue painting are visible on the left wall. The camera, initially at the subject's level, cranes upward. This movement shifts the perspective to a bird's-eye view, causing the man's head to move out of the top of the frame, leaving only his torso and legs visible. Consequently, the black-and-white checkered floor becomes the dominant visual element in the background, and the table is repositioned to the center with several chairs becoming visible around it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
