  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot of a vast desert landscape under a bright, hazy sun. The composition is dominated by large, rolling sand dunes that extend from the middle ground to the background, stretching across the frame. The sun is positioned in the top left, with a pale blue sky filling the upper portion of the frame. A flat expanse of sand extends across the foreground at the bottom. A single palm tree stands in the right foreground, with another smaller one visible on a dune slope in the left middle ground. A few more distant palm trees are scattered in the valley between the dunes in the center-middle ground. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant dunes in sharp detail. The shot remains static, filmed from a level angle, capturing the immense scale and stark, windswept atmosphere of the desert environment. The only discernible movement is the fine sand being blown across the surface of the dunes by the wind, along with the slight motion of the palm tree leaves. The dunes are a light tan color, with smooth, sweeping curves and deep shadows defining their shapes. The sun shines brightly, its light diffused by the atmosphere, creating a dusty haze throughout the scene. The few sparse palm trees, visible in the distance and in the middleground, stand against the immense scale of the dunes, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape rather than acting as focal points.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast desert under a bright, hazy sun. The scene is dominated by massive, rolling sand dunes that create a series of smooth, undulating lines across the horizon against a pale blue sky. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and stark, windswept atmosphere of the desert environment. A few distant palm trees are visible, but they serve only to emphasize the vastness of the landscape rather than acting as a focal point.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
