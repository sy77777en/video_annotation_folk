  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a desert landscape, capturing an expansive view of the terrain. Initially, the frame is dominated by a dense cloud of sand and dust particles filling the foreground and middle ground, obscuring much of the scenery. These particles are scattered across the entire frame, with some appearing closer to the camera in the foreground and others further away in the middle ground. The video begins with a view inside this cloud of flying dust. The camera, positioned at eye level with a high angle, looks down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It continuously moves forward and leftward while simultaneously panning right to adjust its orientation, with a slight clockwise roll that introduces a varying Dutch angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the video progresses, the camera moves through the cloud of dust, gradually revealing more of the desert environment. The sand dunes become visible in the background, extending from the left side of the frame towards the center and right. The dunes occupy the upper portion of the frame, while the sandy path winds through the lower part, curving slightly towards the left. The camera maintains a low height relative to the sand dunes, offering a close perspective of the ground and the swirling particles. The sky remains visible in the top portion of the frame, providing a clear backdrop to the dynamic motion of the sand and dust. The transition from the initial obscured view to the clearer desert scene occurs smoothly as the camera moves forward, exiting the cloud of particles. The scene features vast stretches of sand dunes with a smooth, undulating texture. The sand is a warm, golden hue, and the environment is dry and arid. The sky is a bright blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the desert. The overall setting is open and natural, emphasizing the vastness and isolation of the desert terrain.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback speeds. The camera is positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera continuously moves forward and leftward while simultaneously panning right to adjust its orientation, with a slight clockwise roll that introduces a varying Dutch angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video captures the dynamic desert landscape, with a strong emphasis on the mesmerizing movement of flying dust and sand particles. The camera skillfully highlights the swirling dust, creating a sense of scale and immersion in the environment. As the scene progresses, the camera exits the swirling dust.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view inside a cloud of flying dust. The camera gradually moves leftward, moving away from the dust cloud, revealing the sandy terrain.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, highlights the dynamic motion of sand and debris being kicked up towards the drone, creating a sense of movement and activity within the expansive desert landscape under clear daylight. The scene features vast stretches of sand dunes with a smooth, undulating texture. The sand is a warm, golden hue, and the environment is dry and arid. The sky is a bright blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the desert. The overall setting is open and natural, emphasizing the vastness and isolation of the desert terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
