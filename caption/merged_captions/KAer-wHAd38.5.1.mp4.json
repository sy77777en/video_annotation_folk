  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a rural landscape, capturing the expansive environment from a low angle relative to the road. The scene begins with a view of a wide, dusty road leading towards a bridge, with a weight limit sign of 30 tons positioned before the bridge on the right side. The sign is initially prominent in the center of the frame. The video begins by capturing the scene from an eye-level, level angle perspective slightly looking upward, and then tilts downward to transition to an eye-level, completely level-angle view. A motorcycle appears from the center of the frame, approaching the bridge. The motorcycle continues to move forward, crossing the bridge in the opposite direction of the camera and exits the frame on the left side, near the camera. The camera moves smoothly forward along the road, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene, from the road in the foreground to the sky in the background, sharp and clear. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward along the road, switching to a level angle while gradually approaching the bridge. The bridge, with its concrete structure and metal railings, becomes more central in the frame, spanning across the middle ground. The road curves slightly to the left, guiding the viewer's eye towards the bridge. In the background, a cluster of lush green trees occupies the left side of the frame, while a red gate and two buildings appear further back on the right. The sky, filled with scattered, fluffy clouds, dominates the upper portion of the frame throughout the video. The camera maintains a consistent height, keeping the road and bridge at eye level, providing a continuous and immersive perspective of the rural setting. The spatial composition shifts subtly as the camera advances, bringing the bridge into greater prominence while the initial foreground elements recede.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere. A distant red gate is visible, with some buildings behind it.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a road under a partly cloudy sky, with a speed limit sign of 30t visible near a small bridge. A motorcycle appears from the center of the frame, approaching the bridge. The motorcycle continues to move forward, crossing the bridge in the opposite direction of the camera and exits the frame on the left side, near the camera. The camera then moves forward, focusing on the bridge and the road ahead.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor rural setting during the day, featuring a wide, dusty road leading to a bridge. The sky is bright with scattered clouds, casting soft shadows on the ground. On the left side of the frame, there is a cluster of lush green trees and a small hill. At the end of the bridge, a red gate is visible with two buildings behind it. The bridge, made of concrete with metal railings, spans a small body of water. A traffic sign indicates a weight limit of 30 tons, suggesting a structured environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and open, with natural and man-made elements harmoniously coexisting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
