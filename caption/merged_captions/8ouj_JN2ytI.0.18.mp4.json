  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot where a large group of police officers, mostly men, collectively occupies the central area of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and background as they move forward through a dimly lit tunnel. Many are dressed in dark uniforms, with some individuals wearing police hats or helmets, and the word \"POLICE\" is visible in white capital letters on the back of at least one person's uniform. The tunnel features dark, possibly concrete walls, with small yellow lights visible on the left wall in the middle ground, and white circular lights are spaced along the ceiling, receding from the middle ground into the background. The camera is at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus on the midground. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, tracking the group of police officers running ahead from a rear-side angle. The densely packed crowd, including some in riot gear and others in regular uniforms, advances from the foreground deeper into the tunnel towards the background in a coordinated manner, suggesting the tunnel is a secure area, possibly a police or military facility, given the presence of SWAT officers and the overall organized movement. Suddenly, the officers stop and turn around, seemingly drawn by something behind them, causing a shift in their positions and focus. The camera also slows its forward movement and appears to come to a stop as the officers turn around. The dark tunnel walls are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame, and the series of brighter, white, circular lights extend into the receding darkness.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, tracking a group of police officers running ahead from a rear-side angle. Towards the end, as the police officers suddenly stop and turn around, the camera also slows its forward movement and appears to come to a stop.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a large group of police officers, mostly men, walking forward in a dimly lit, narrow, enclosed space. Many are dressed in dark uniforms, with some individuals wearing police hats or helmets. The word \"POLICE\" is visible in white capital letters on the back of at least one person's uniform. The officers are clustered together, moving in the same direction, until they all suddenly stop and turn around at the end.",
    "Motion": "A large group of police officers, some in riot gear and others in regular uniforms, are initially advancing in a coordinated manner through a dimly lit tunnel with yellow and white lights lining the walls. The tunnel appears to be a secure area, possibly a police or military facility, given the presence of SWAT officers and the overall organized movement. Suddenly, the officers stop and turn around, seemingly drawn by something behind them, causing a shift in their positions and focus.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a large group of people, many in dark uniforms with some identifiable as police, moving through a long, dimly lit indoor tunnel. The tunnel features dark, possibly concrete walls, with small, yellow lights mounted at intervals on one side. A series of brighter, white, circular lights are spaced along the dark ceiling, extending into the receding darkness. The densely packed crowd advances deeper into the tunnel.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot where a large group of police officers collectively occupies the central area of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and background as they move forward through a dimly lit tunnel. Small yellow lights are visible on the left wall in the middle ground, and white circular lights are spaced along the ceiling, receding from the middle ground into the background. The dark tunnel walls are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame. The group advances from the foreground deeper into the tunnel towards the background, then abruptly stops and turns around. The camera is positioned above the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
