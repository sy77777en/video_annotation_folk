  "merged_caption": "This video starts with a full shot of a large Komodo dragon with brownish-gray, beaded skin and a powerful, muscular body in the center-left of the frame, located in the middle ground. To its right, a large, brown, rectangular cardboard box stands upright in the middle ground, with a background of a grey, rocky wall and green, leafy plants scattered with dry twigs and a few green leaves. The floor is covered with a layer of brown wood chips. The Komodo dragon, with its long, thick tail, sturdy legs with dark, clawed feet, and an elongated head, stands beside the cardboard box and flicks its long, forked tongue out to investigate it. The camera, from an eye-level perspective, starts stationary with a level angle, capturing the scene in deep focus with a large depth of field. The lizard then turns its head to the right and walks away from the box, moving across the wood-chip-covered ground with a low, lumbering gait. Its body sways from side to side as it proceeds from left to right across the frame, flicking its tongue out again as it moves. The camera pans and trucks to the right to follow the lizard, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses on the dragon's upper body. As the camera tracks the subject, the framing transitions, and the dragon continues its path across the frame from left to right, getting closer to the camera. As it approaches, the dragon appears larger, and its tail is no longer visible. The slightly unsteady handheld camera ends with a slight pan to the left, capturing the scene with a high angle as the Komodo dragon moves, and the large cardboard box gradually shifts to the left side of the screen.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, the slightly unsteady handheld camera tracks a lizard from the side. The shot begins with a level angle that transitions to a high angle as the camera moves. The camera starts stationary, then pans and trucks to the right to follow the lizard, ending with a slight pan to the left. The scene is captured in deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A large Komodo dragon with brownish-gray, beaded skin and a powerful, muscular body walks across the scene. It has a long, thick tail, sturdy legs with dark, clawed feet, and an elongated head. The lizard initially approaches a large, brown, rectangular cardboard box standing upright, flicking its long, forked tongue out to investigate it before continuing on its path.",
    "Motion": "A Komodo dragon stands beside a cardboard box and flicks its forked tongue out to investigate it. The lizard then turns its head to the right and walks away from the box, moving across the wood-chip-covered ground with a low, lumbering gait. Its body sways from side to side as it proceeds from left to right across the frame, flicking its tongue out again as it moves.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within an indoor enclosure designed to replicate a natural habitat, where a Komodo dragon is present. The floor is covered with a layer of brown wood chips, scattered with dry twigs and a few green leaves. In the background, a grey, rocky wall stands behind green, leafy plants and bare branches. As the Komodo dragon moves and the camera follows its motion, a large, brown cardboard box gradually shifts to the left side of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "This video starts with a full shot of a Komodo dragon in the center-left of the frame, located in the middle ground. To its right, a large cardboard box stands in the middle ground, with a background of a rocky wall and green plants. The dragon walks from the center towards the right, and the camera pans to follow its movement. As the camera tracks the subject, the framing transitions to a medium shot, focusing on the dragon's upper body. The dragon continues its path across the frame from left to right, getting closer to the camera. As it approaches, the dragon appears larger, and its tail is no longer visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
