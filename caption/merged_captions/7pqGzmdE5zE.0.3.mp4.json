  "merged_caption": "This video is framed as a medium close-up, captured from over the person's left shoulder, with the camera positioned at eye level, looking down from a high angle. The camera maintains a static position throughout the video, providing a high-angle view. The focus is shallow, keeping the laptop and hands in the midground sharp while blurring the foreground. The silver MacBook Pro laptop occupies the center of the frame and sits in the middle ground on a white surface, likely a bed or sofa cover. The laptop screen displays an audio editing application with a sound waveform, centrally located within the laptop's frame. The person's light-skinned right hand, adorned with a small black hair tie, is positioned in the bottom right corner of the frame, resting in the foreground as it actively clicks and moves on the MacBook's touchpad. A blurred section of the person's head and shoulder is visible in the top right corner, also in the foreground. Positioned to the right of the laptop, also in the middle ground, is a dark-colored smartphone with a reflective screen. The laptop is connected to an adapter and cable, but not to the smartphone. The ambient indoor lighting illuminates the scene, highlighting the macOS interface on the laptop screen, which features a coastal landscape in the background. The person's head and shoulder remain out of focus in the foreground, while the laptop and hands remain sharp in the midground. The video captures the dynamic interaction of the person's hand with the laptop, emphasizing the active use of the audio editing application.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
