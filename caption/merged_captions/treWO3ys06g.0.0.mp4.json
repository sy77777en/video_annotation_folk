  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, where a person lies prone in the foreground on an asphalt road, occupying the bottom half of the frame from the center-left to the far right. The person is dressed entirely in black attire, including a leather jacket, pants, gloves, black shoes, and a black full-face motorcycle helmet with a tinted visor that obscures their face. Bright yellow patches, which are their socks, are visible on both ankles. In the middle ground, a mossy hillside with a small stream on the left fills the upper portion of the frame, while a larger mountain with snow, part of the same continuous land feature, is visible in the background on the top right. The scene is set in a remote, mountainous landscape under an overcast sky. As the person pushes their upper body up with their arms, the camera, positioned at hip level, slowly and unsteadily tilts upward, following their vertical movement. They bring their knees forward, transitioning to a position on their hands and knees. The camera's motion transitions from a level to a low angle, maintaining deep focus to keep both the person and the expansive landscape sharp. The person then rises to a standing position, and the shot transitions into a medium-full shot, reframing the now-standing person in the center-left of the frame. As they stumble backward towards the center-right, the upward tilt reveals more of the background mountain and the overcast sky.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level position, the camera slowly and unsteadily tilts up, following a person in a helmet as they rise from the ground. This motion transitions the camera from a level to a low angle. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping both the person and the expansive landscape in the background sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person, whose gender is not discernible, is dressed entirely in black attire, consisting of a leather jacket, pants, gloves, and black shoes. They are also wearing a black full-face motorcycle helmet with a tinted visor that completely obscures their face. Bright yellow patches, which are their socks, are visible on both ankles. The video begins with the person lying face down on an asphalt surface. They then push themselves up, first into a push-up position, then onto their knees, and finally rise to a standing position.",
    "Motion": "A person lying face down on an asphalt road pushes their upper body up with their arms. They then bring their knees forward, transitioning to a position on their hands and knees before rising to a standing position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a dark asphalt road in a remote, mountainous landscape under an overcast sky. A steep, mossy hillside, dark green and brown in color, rises directly from the edge of the road, with a small stream of water trickling down its face. In the background, a larger mountain with patches of snow near its peak appears to be part of the same continuous land formation as the hillside. A person wearing a black motorcycle helmet and dark clothing is positioned on the road at the base of the hillside.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
