  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot centers on a yellow balloon in the middle ground resting on a wooden stool in the foreground. A person, wearing a light pink shirt and gray shorts, is partially visible, with a hand holding a scimitar positioned in the top-center middle ground, directly above the balloon. The person's torso is visible in the center of the further middle ground. The static, high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the yellow water balloon. The video employs a speed ramp, slowing down before the knife pierces the balloon to capture the water's explosion in detail. The hand and knife move downward, striking and slicing the balloon in the center of the frame. The balloon instantly bursts, and the water inside explodes outward in a dramatic splash that covers the stool. Torn pieces of the yellow balloon are propelled away from the center with the spray. The knife continues its downward trajectory, coming to rest in the center of the now water-covered stool. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the action, returning to normal speed at the end. The background is a soft-focus view of the paved ground and distant greenery, enhancing the focus on the action of the balloon being popped and the subsequent splash of water.",

    "Subject": "The video features a yellow balloon placed on a wooden stool. A person, wearing a light pink shirt and gray shorts, is partially visible, holding a knife. The person uses the knife to pop the balloon, resulting in water splashing onto the stool. The focus is on the action of the balloon being popped and the subsequent splash of water.",
    "Motion": "A person brings a knife down, piercing and slicing a yellow water balloon resting on a wooden stool. The balloon instantly bursts, and the water inside explodes outward in a dramatic splash that covers the stool. The knife continues its downward trajectory, striking the surface of the stool.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting on a paved surface, a single yellow water balloon sits atop a round wooden stool. A hand holding a scimitar is positioned above the balloon. The scimitar is brought down, piercing the balloon, which then bursts in a dramatic slow-motion sequence. Water explodes outwards in a wide splash, covering the wooden stool, while torn pieces of the yellow balloon are propelled away with the spray. The background is a soft-focus view of the paved ground and distant greenery.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot centers on a yellow balloon in the middle ground resting on a wooden stool in the foreground. A person's hand holding a knife is positioned in the top-center middle ground, directly above the balloon, with the person's torso visible in the center of the further middle ground. The hand and knife move downward, striking the balloon in the center of the frame. The balloon bursts, causing water to splash outwards from the center, covering the stool and moving toward the foreground. Torn pieces of the yellow balloon are also propelled away from the center. The knife continues its downward motion, coming to rest in the center of the now water-covered stool. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
