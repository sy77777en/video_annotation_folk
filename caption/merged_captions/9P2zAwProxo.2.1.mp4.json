  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a light-skinned man with a short beard and mustache, dressed in winter ski attire including a black and white jacket, black pants, black gloves, a black helmet, and dark-lensed ski goggles, is positioned in the center-left foreground on a snowy slope. He holds a camera on a pole at his level for a selfie-style perspective, capturing himself as he descends a wide, snow-covered slope at a ski resort during the daytime under a bright, overcast sky. The run is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees on the right and a safety fence on the left, with ski lift structures visible in the background, creating depth. The man maintains a forward-leaning posture, looking directly into the camera as he moves down the hill. The shot utilizes a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, filmed from a low, hip-level perspective with a Dutch angle that varies as the camera rolls. A deep focus keeps the entire snowy landscape sharp. The slightly unsteady camera tracks the skier from the front, moving continuously downward and forward along the slope. As the man and camera move forward together, the background scenery recedes and shifts past him. Towards the end, the camera pans left and starts to roll clockwise, enhancing the dynamic motion of the scene.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with a short beard and mustache is shown on a snowy slope. He is dressed in winter ski attire, including a black and white jacket, black pants, and black gloves. He wears a black helmet, and his dark-lensed ski goggles cover his eyes. He is looking directly at the camera, which he appears to be holding on a pole, capturing a selfie-style video. His body is angled forward as he moves on skis or a snowboard.",
    "Motion": "A man moves down a snowy slope while holding a camera on a pole, filming himself. He maintains a forward-leaning posture and looks directly into the camera as he descends the hill.",
    "Scene": "In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, a skier descends a wide, snow-covered slope at a ski resort. The scene takes place during the daytime under a bright, overcast sky. The run is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees on both sides, with a safety fence running along the edge on the left side. In the background, the structures of ski lifts and poles can be seen further up the mountain, creating a sense of depth on the expansive slope.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium full shot, a man in ski gear is positioned in the center-left foreground, holding the camera at his level for a selfie-style perspective. He remains relatively static within the frame as he moves down a wide, snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. On the right, a line of bare trees occupies the middle ground and background. To the left, a safety fence is visible in the middle ground, with additional trees and ski lift structures situated in the background. As the man and camera move forward together, the background scenery recedes and shifts past him."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
