  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle perspective looking upward, the scene is dominated by the black silhouette of a large, gnarled tree in the foreground. The main trunk occupies the center of the frame, extending from the bottom edge upwards, with smaller silhouetted branches visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera executes a smooth, counterclockwise roll, revealing a night sky filled with white star trails. In a time-lapse sequence, the stars move across the night sky, creating long, bright trails. On the left side of the frame, these trails form concentric, curved arcs around a point off-screen, while on the right side, they appear as straighter, diagonal streaks. The silhouetted tree in the foreground remains stationary against the celestial display. The upward-looking perspective captures the movement of stars across the dark expanse, rendering them as long, white streaks of light that create a pattern of motion. The trails on the left side curve in distinct arcs, while those on the right are more linear and parallel. The complete, black silhouette of the large, gnarled tree stands starkly contrasted against the starry sky, with its thick trunk positioned centrally and several bare, twisted branches reaching upward.",

    "Scene": "From an upward-looking perspective, a time-lapse captures the movement of stars across a dark night sky. The stars are rendered as long, white streaks of light, creating a pattern of motion. On the left side, the trails form distinct, curved arcs, while on the right, they appear as straighter, more parallel lines. Dominating the foreground is the dark, featureless silhouette of a large, gnarled tree trunk and its bare branches, starkly contrasted against the celestial display.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
