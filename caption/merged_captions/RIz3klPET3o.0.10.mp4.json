  "merged_caption": "This video is presented as an extreme wide shot from a side-on perspective, featuring a cartoon character, rendered in a sketchy black-and-white style, on a sled-like vehicle. Initially, the character, wearing a white helmet with a black outline, is positioned in the lower-left quadrant, situated on a curved black line against a plain, light gray background. The number '40' is visible in the bottom left, with several short, floating black dashes in the upper portion of the frame. The character slides down the irregular, hand-drawn paths, each varying in length and angle, creating dynamic movement as the camera smoothly tracks the character from the side, moving from right to left and descending to follow its jumps. The scene includes several hand-drawn black lines, with the long, curved path emphasizing the character's movement. As the character continues to slide down the line while remaining in the lower-left quadrant, the scene then cuts, repositioning the character on a new, steeper line. The number '42' and the letter 'f' now appear in the upper-left quadrant. The character continues to slide down this new path, staying in the lower-left quadrant throughout the video. The camera maintains its smooth tracking, capturing the lively and engaging motion of the character as it navigates the uniquely curved lines. The entire visual is presented in a minimalist, hand-drawn style, with the scene set in a side-view gaming video aesthetic.",

    "Motion": "A cartoon character on a sled navigates a series of irregular, hand-drawn paths, each varying in length and angle. The dynamic movement is highlighted as the character slides down these uniquely curved lines, creating an engaging and lively scene.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video with a minimalist, hand-drawn aesthetic, the scene is set against a plain, light gray background. Several black, curved lines collectively form a track or slope. The number '40' is drawn next to a section of this track, while both short and long dashed lines appear in the upper and lower portions of the screen as the character slides downward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
