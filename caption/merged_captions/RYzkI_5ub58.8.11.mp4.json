  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a vast underwater scene where a large school of small, silvery, elongated fish predominantly fills the foreground and middle ground, contrasting against the blue sea backdrop. These small fish are seen swimming generally from the right side of the frame towards the left, creating a dynamic, swirling pattern as a few change direction along the way. Positioned in the center of the frame is a single, larger, dark gray fish with a deep, rounded body and prominent fins, which is facing away from the camera and slowly swimming forward. The camera is positioned below this larger fish, looking up at it amidst the school of smaller fish. The shot is static and stable, employing a deep focus to keep the entire aquatic scene in sharp detail. The water itself transitions from a bright, light blue at the top, where sunlight filters through, to a deeper, darker blue in the depths below.",

    "Camera": "From a low, underwater angle, the camera looks up at a large fish swimming amidst a school of smaller fish. The shot is static and stable, employing a deep focus to keep the entire aquatic scene in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "In an underwater scene, a large school of small, silvery, elongated fish fills the entire sea area, swimming generally from right to left. Positioned in the center of the picture, behind the school, is a single, larger, dark gray fish with a deep, rounded body and prominent fins.",
    "Motion": "A large, dark fish swims slowly forward at the back of a vast school of smaller, silver fish, with its back to the camera. The silvery school of fish is closer to the camera, and most of the smaller fish swim from right to left, with a few changing direction along the way, creating a dynamic, swirling pattern.",
    "Scene": "An underwater scene unfolds in the vast, blue expanse of the open ocean. A single, large, dark-colored fish is positioned in the middle of the frame, surrounded by a massive school of smaller, silvery fish. The countless small fish swim predominantly from the right side of the frame to the left, filling the water around the larger creature. The water itself transitions from a bright, light blue at the top, where sunlight filters through, to a deeper, darker blue in the depths below.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot captures a vast underwater scene where a large school of small, silvery fish predominantly fills the foreground and middle ground, contrasting against the blue sea backdrop. These small fish are seen swimming generally from the right side of the frame towards the left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
