  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man wearing a tan hooded jacket, black pants, and a grey beanie with goggles pushed up onto it, carrying a snowboard with a red and yellow design, begins in the center-left foreground, walking across a paved airfield marked with blue lines toward a helicopter positioned in the middle ground. The helicopter, with its rotors spinning, features a vibrant, graffiti-style wrap in red, white, and dark blue or black with prominent Red Bull branding, contrasted by a black and white nose, while the area surrounding the cockpit is yellow. The setting is outdoors under a cloudy sky, with a background of dry, grassy fields and distant mountains. The helicopter is angled from the center-left toward the top-right of the frame. As the man walks, the handheld camera follows him from behind at an unsteady, eye-level perspective, tracking forward as he moves toward the helicopter, growing larger in the frame. He steps up onto the landing skid, climbs through the open side door, and sits down on a black bench seat inside the aircraft, facing the camera and looking toward the side. The camera then becomes stationary, with continued handheld shaking, as he boards the helicopter. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The final composition shows him sitting in the middle ground inside the helicopter, which now occupies nearly the entire frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the handheld camera follows a man from behind as he moves toward a helicopter. As the camera tracks forward, the man grows larger in the frame.

    "Subject": "A man wearing a tan hooded jacket, black pants, and a grey beanie with goggles pushed up onto it walks toward a helicopter while carrying a snowboard with a red and yellow design. He steps up into the open side door of the helicopter and sits down on a black bench seat, facing the camera and looking toward the side. The helicopter has a distinctive and colorful wrap; its front is yellow, while the main body and tail are covered in a busy, graffiti-style pattern of red, white, and dark blue or black. The \"Red Bull\" logo is featured prominently in red text on the side of the aircraft.",
    "Motion": "A man carrying a snowboard walks across a tarmac toward a stationary helicopter with its rotors spinning. He steps up onto the landing skid, climbs through the open side door, and sits down on a bench inside the aircraft before turning to look out.",
    "Scene": "On a paved airfield marked with blue lines, a person in a tan hooded jacket and black pants walks toward a helicopter with its rotors in motion. The helicopter features a vibrant, graffiti-style wrap in red, white, and blue with prominent Red Bull branding, contrasted by a black and white nose, while the area surrounding the cockpit is yellow. The individual, carrying a snowboard, steps onto the landing skid and enters the open side door of the aircraft. The setting is outdoors under a cloudy sky, with a background of dry, grassy fields and distant mountains.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man with a snowboard begins in the center-left foreground, walking toward a helicopter positioned in the middle ground, which is angled from the center-left toward the top-right of the frame. In the background, mountains are visible under a cloudy sky. As the man walks, the camera follows him, and he moves toward the center-left of the frame to step into the helicopter's open door. The camera slightly shakes as he enters, with the final composition showing him sitting in the middle ground inside the helicopter, which now occupies nearly the entire frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
