  "merged_caption": "The wide shot, filmed at subject level, initially shows a light silver four-door sedan in the background, left of center, driving along a dirt road that extends from the foreground. The camera starts at ground level and moves to eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus for a large depth of field. Initially, it moves upward and tilts down slightly while panning right to track the silver sedan. An olive green Ford F-150 pickup truck is parked in the middle ground on the right, with a weathered, unpainted wooden house visible in the background, also on the right. The house has some windows featuring light blue shutters and a porch. Numerous trees populate the middle ground and background across the frame, including tall pines and a distinct palm tree in the middle ground to the left of the road, with some trees draped in Spanish moss. The sky is overcast. The silver sedan moves from the background, diagonally towards the right and slightly into the middle ground, then turns left to park in the middle ground, center-right, behind the stationary pickup truck. As the sedan comes to a stop, a man wearing dark pants appears from behind the house on the right and approaches the newly parked sedan, walking from the back of the house towards the car. The area is surrounded by patches of green grass, enhancing the rural, wooded setting.",

The scene is set in a wooded area with numerous trees, including tall pines and a palm tree visible to the left of the road.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a rural, wooded area with a dirt road leading towards a rustic, unpainted wooden house. The house has visible windows with blue shutters and a porch. A dark gray Ford F-150 pickup truck is parked on the dirt near the house. A silver Chevrolet Malibu sedan drives up the dirt road and parks behind the pickup truck.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
