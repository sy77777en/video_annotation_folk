  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two individuals, capturing their upper bodies and faces. The boy is positioned on the right side of the frame, occupying the foreground and closer to the camera, while the older man is on the left, slightly further back in the middle ground. The man's initial position has his head lowered, then he lifts it to face the boy, maintaining eye contact throughout. The boy, seen from behind and slightly to the left, remains stationary. Both are centered horizontally within the frame. The background consists of a neutral-colored wall with a framed picture located in the top-center, providing depth to the scene. The camera maintains a steady position at the subjects' height, emphasizing their interaction without any noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning. The video features an eye-level camera capturing a low-angle shot, looking up at the subjects. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the old man in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, and it captures an over-the-shoulder shot from a third-person perspective, centering the old man. The video shows an older man with gray hair and a lined face, wearing a dark green sweater over a collared shirt, interacting with a boy. The man initially has his head lowered but gradually lifts it to look at the boy, maintaining a contemplative expression without smiling. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and slightly to the left, wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. The environment is intimate, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a framed picture in the background. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a room with warm lighting. The environment is intimate, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a framed picture in the background. The scene includes two subjects: one is facing the camera, allowing a view of their upper body, while the other is facing away, with only their head visible. The subjects are engaged in a moment of interaction, adding a sense of personal connection to the setting. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
