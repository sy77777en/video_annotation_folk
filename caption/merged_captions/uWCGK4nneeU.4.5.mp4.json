  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an aerial extreme wide shot, with the sky filling the top two-thirds of the frame and a desert mountain range occupying the bottom third, extending from the foreground to the background. A single, fluffy white cloud is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, contrasting with the arid, brown terrain. The environment is dry and barren, with no vegetation visible, and the time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and absence of shadows. The camera features an aerial-level view at a low angle, looking up, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves forward slowly and smoothly, capturing the entire scene comprehensively. As the video progresses, a small helicopter enters from the far left of the frame, characterized by its dark color and a darker contrail that stands out against the clear blue sky, moving steadily towards the right. Simultaneously, a larger plane enters from the far right, notable for its red color and a gray, cone-like structure attached to its rear by strings, from which it releases a white contrail, moving towards the left. Both aircraft fly horizontally toward the central cloud, maintaining their altitude above the desert landscape. The helicopter and plane are distinct in their movement and color, contrasting with the serene backdrop of the mountains and sky. The two aircraft continue their respective paths, approaching each other in the middle of the frame, with the helicopter on the left and the plane on the right. The video concludes before the aircraft cross paths and move past the cloud, maintaining an objective perspective that captures the expansive and open nature of the desert.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a low angle, looking up. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, capturing the entire scene comprehensively.",
    "Subject": "The video features a mountain range under a clear blue sky, with a prominent white cloud at the center. Initially, the scene is static, focusing on the natural landscape. As the video progresses, a helicopter enters from the left, characterized by its small size, dark color, and a darker contrail that stands out against the clear sky. A plane enters from the right, notable for its larger size, red color, and a gray, cone-like structure attached to its rear by strings, from which it releases a white contrail. Both aircraft move toward the center, where the cloud is located, occupying about 10% of the frame's height. The helicopter and plane are distinct in their movement and color, contrasting with the serene backdrop of the mountains and sky.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky, with a single white cloud in the center. As the video progresses, a helicopter appears from the left side of the frame, moving steadily towards the right. Simultaneously, a plane enters from the right side, also moving towards the left, with a gray, cone-like structure attached to its rear from which a white contrail is released. Both aircraft continue their respective paths, approaching each other in the middle of the frame, with the helicopter on the left and the plane on the right. The video concludes before the aircraft cross paths and move past the cloud.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a vast desert landscape under a clear blue sky, with rolling dunes and distant mountain ranges. A single, fluffy white cloud floats in the center of the scene, contrasting with the arid, brown terrain. The environment is dry and barren, with no vegetation visible. The time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and absence of shadows. Two aircraft appear, trailing smoke as they move across the sky, adding dynamic motion to the otherwise still setting. The scene maintains an objective perspective, capturing the expansive and open nature of the desert.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an aerial extreme wide shot, with the sky filling the top two-thirds of the frame and a desert mountain range occupying the bottom third, extending from the foreground to the background. A single cloud is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground. A small helicopter then enters from the far left of the frame, and a larger plane enters from the far right, both positioned in the middle ground. The two aircraft fly horizontally toward the central cloud, maintaining their altitude above the desert landscape. The camera remains static and positioned below the aircraft, providing a consistent low-angle view of their movement across the sky."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
