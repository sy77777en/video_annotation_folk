  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a small human figure is consistently visible in the center of the middle ground, partially obscured by multiple silhouetted trees in the foreground. The individual is wearing dark pants and a dark reddish top, with light skin noticeable on their hands and part of their face, which is partially covered by a mask over the lower half. The camera, from a level angle, smoothly tracks the avatar in a side-view game, initially trucking left slightly, pausing, and then trucking right to follow the figure as it runs from left to right through a dark, wooded landscape. The figure moves at a steady pace across a grassy clearing, passing silhouetted trees and heading towards distant, dimly lit structures. As the camera progresses, various silhouetted trees pass through the foreground and middle ground, eventually revealing large, dark industrial structures in the right background. The scene is set within a dark, misty forest at night, with the camera moving to the right across a grassy clearing populated by the dark silhouettes of trees. As the character approaches the industrial area, large, angular, industrial-style structures and a single red light become visible through the dense, blue-green mist. The camera maintains a side-on perspective at the subject's height, and a white logo with the letters \"IGN\" is overlaid in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "In a low-light environment, a human figure is visible wearing dark pants and a dark reddish top. The individual's light skin is noticeable on their hands and part of their face, which is partially covered by a mask over the lower half. The figure is consistently small and seen from a distance, making finer details of their features or clothing difficult to discern against the dark, silhouetted surroundings.",
    "Motion": "A small figure runs from left to right through a dark, wooded landscape. The camera tracks to the right, following the individual as they move at a steady pace across a grassy clearing, passing silhouetted trees and heading towards distant, dimly lit structures.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video captures a scene set within a dark, misty forest at night. The camera moves to the right across a grassy clearing populated by the dark silhouettes of trees. As the character approaches the industrial area, large, angular, industrial-style structures and a single red light become visible through the dense, blue-green mist. A white 'IGN' logo is present as a watermark in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
