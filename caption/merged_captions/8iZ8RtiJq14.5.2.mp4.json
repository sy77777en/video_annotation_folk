  "merged_caption": "The camera, positioned at hip-level and using a shallow depth of field, smoothly moves downward in this shot. In the foreground, a beige, slatted panel is positioned on the left, occupying the left third of the frame and remaining in sharp focus. In the middle ground, a person sits completely still on a light brown couch, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved top and dark pants. The person is positioned to the left of the frame's center and is partially obscured by the foreground panel. The couch extends from the center to the right edge of the frame. The entire middle ground, including the person and the couch, is blurred. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing them in a medium shot. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, viewed from behind the light-colored panel with horizontal slats on the left. The person is seated on a light-colored sofa with cushions, positioned against a dark wall. A bright, white light glows intensely from the figure's head area, creating a glowing effect that obscures any facial details, while the background is a dark environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
