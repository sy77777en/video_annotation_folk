  "merged_caption": "The video captures a high-angle, wide shot of a soccer goal corner, with the white, square-meshed net prominently stretching from the top left to the bottom right. In the lower part of the frame, a bright green surface is visible on the bottom and left sides, bordered by a thick white line. Two black cylindrical objects rest on this green surface; one is situated in the upper-left area, and the other is more centrally located. As the camera dollies forward quickly and smoothly over the soccer goal, the soccer ball is seen spinning within the netting, becoming the focal point against the white net. The vertical white goalpost becomes visible on the right edge, seamlessly blending with the net, while a darker green surface appears in the background. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and the bright, even light illuminates the vibrant green field.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera dollies forward quickly and smoothly over a soccer goal. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A wide shot captures a soccer ball spinning in the white, square-meshed net of a goal. The bright green ground within the goal is bordered by a thick white line, with two long, black, cylindrical objects resting parallel to the line.",
    "Motion": "This video features a dynamic, high-angle shot of a soccer goal, with the camera moving forward and the soccer ball quickly rotating in the net.",
    "Scene": "The scene captures a wide view of a soccer ball spinning within the netting of a goal on a vibrant green field. The ball is the focal point, highlighted against the white net with its square mesh. A thick white line runs along the ground in front of the goal, and the area behind the goal is a darker shade of green, all illuminated by bright, even light.",

In the lower part of the frame, a bright green surface is visible on the bottom and left sides, bordered by a thick white line. Two black cylindrical objects rest on this green surface; one is situated in the upper-left area, and the other is more centrally located.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
