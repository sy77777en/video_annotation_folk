  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up from within a dark mechanical interior, highlighting a blue-lit surface in the top right. The camera, with an extremely shallow depth of field, smoothly moves backward while rotating counterclockwise, revealing layers of interlocking gears and levers. As the camera moves, many gears gradually enter the frame, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground. The focus remains on the intricate details of the machinery, with a blurred background that obscures the camera's exact position. This video features an extreme close-up of the intricate internal mechanism of an old, complex machine. The components, which include interlocking gears of various sizes and supporting levers, are made of a dark metal with a slightly rough, non-reflective texture. The entire assembly is seen in very low light, with a cool blue light source casting subtle highlights on the edges and teeth of the static gears, emphasizing their shape and complexity against the deep shadows of the machine's interior. Under dim, cool-blue lighting, the camera slowly moves through layers of static, interlocking metallic gears and cogs. The components, rendered in dark gray and silver, are tightly arranged within a shadowed framework. The limited light catches the textured surfaces and toothed edges of the wheels, revealing the intricate and dense construction of the machinery. The metal walls enclosing the mechanism, along with other components of the apparatus, are also visible under the lighting, adding depth to the scene. The static components are revealed in their complex, interlocking structure under low light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
