  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a cowboy shot of a middle-aged man with a beard and a shaved or balding head, positioned centrally in a stark, monochromatic scene rendered in a dithered, high-contrast style of black and white. He appears to be shirtless or is wearing a light-colored top. The man stands within a confined indoor space, possibly a narrow corridor or room, framed by a dark structure in the left foreground. In the background, a panel with lights or buttons is visible. The man raises a pistol with his right hand, initially extending it toward the front of the scene. As the camera shifts, the gun appears on the right side of the frame. The pistol is frozen in the act of firing, with a stylized muzzle flash visible in the right foreground as a burst of static white lines and dots. The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a brief, smooth forward dolly toward the man holding the gun. The camera then arcs clockwise in a quarter-circle around the gun. The weapon and the man appear completely motionless, as if frozen in time, with no sign of recoil. The focus is not clearly defined due to the video's stylized, graphic aesthetic.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot begins with a brief, smooth forward dolly toward a man holding a gun. The camera then arcs clockwise in a quarter-circle around the gun. Due to the video's stylized, graphic aesthetic, the focus is not clearly defined.",
    "Subject": "In a high-contrast, black-and-white, pixelated style, a middle-aged man with a beard and a shaved or balding head stands with an intense expression. He appears to be shirtless or is wearing a light-colored top. He holds a pistol with his right hand, aiming it forward and to his right. As he fires the weapon, a spray of white pixels erupts from the muzzle.",
    "Motion": "A man stands holding a pistol forward and to his right. The weapon and the man appear completely motionless, as if frozen in time. A static spray of pixels is visible at the muzzle, with no sign of recoil. The camera perspective moves forward, getting closer to the man and the gun.",
    "Scene": "In a stark, monochromatic scene rendered in a dithered, high-contrast style of black and white, a person stands within a confined indoor space. The setting appears to be a narrow corridor or room, with a panel of buttons or lights visible in the background. The individual is shown standing still, frozen in the process of firing a pistol, with a stylized muzzle flash erupting from the barrel as a burst of static white lines and dots.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a cowboy shot of a man positioned centrally in the scene, framed by a dark structure in the left foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
