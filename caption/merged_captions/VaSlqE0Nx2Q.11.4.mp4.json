  "merged_caption": "In a grainy, black-and-white close-up, the video maintains a stationary, eye-level shot of a child's head, positioned primarily in the center and left of the frame in the middle ground against a completely dark, undefined background. The child's head moves slightly, looking down and around within the shadows, causing different parts of their face to be illuminated by a dim light that intermittently reveals glimpses of their features, including their nose, mouth, and an eye. The child's hand frequently moves from the bottom of the frame into the extreme foreground, becoming a large, out-of-focus shape that at times completely obscures the view of the child's face before moving away to reveal it again. The focus is maintained on the child's face, while the hand, moving closer to the lens, remains out of focus. The shifting illumination suggests either the light source or the child is moving, creating fleeting glimpses of facial features before the scene returns to near-total darkness. The camera remains at the child's level throughout the sequence, making it difficult to determine the camera angle or depth of field due to the dark, indistinct background.",

    "Camera": "This is a stationary, eye-level shot. The focus is maintained on the boy's face, while his hand, moving closer to the lens, is out of focus. The dark, indistinct background makes it difficult to determine the camera angle or depth of field.",
    "Subject": "In a grainy, black-and-white close-up, the head of a child is partially illuminated against a dark background. The child has dark, short hair, and their face is mostly obscured by shadow. As they look down and around, the sparse light reveals glimpses of their features, including their nose, mouth, and an eye. The child's hand frequently moves into the frame, very close to the camera, at times completely blocking the view of their face before it is revealed again.",
    "Motion": "In a grainy, black-and-white close-up, a child's partially illuminated face emerges from the darkness. The child's head moves slightly, looking down and around within the shadows. A hand repeatedly moves into the frame, coming very close to the camera and at times completely obscuring the face before moving away to reveal it again.",
    "Scene": "In a grainy, black-and-white scene set against a completely dark background, a dim light intermittently reveals parts of a person's face. The shifting illumination suggests either the light source or the person is moving, creating fleeting glimpses of facial features before the scene returns to near-total darkness.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a close-up shot of a child's head, positioned primarily in the center and left of the frame in the middle ground against a dark, undefined background. The child's hand repeatedly moves from the bottom of the frame into the extreme foreground, becoming a large, out-of-focus shape that intermittently obscures the view of the child's face. Simultaneously, the child's head shifts and turns within the middle ground, causing different parts of their face to be illuminated. The camera remains at the child's level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
