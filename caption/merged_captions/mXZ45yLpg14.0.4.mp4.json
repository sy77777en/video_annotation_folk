  "merged_caption": "This video employs a medium full shot to capture three figures in a desolate landscape. Initially, a man in dark military gear is situated in the center-left foreground, gesturing with his left hand while holding a rifle in his right hand. He subsequently moves to the right and eventually exits the frame on the right. In the middle ground, a man in an orange hazmat suit with a backpack and a device on his chest is positioned, remaining stationary and looking around as the others continue to walk away. Further back, in the left middle ground, another man in dark military gear is holding a rifle. A vehicle is partially visible in the left background. The environment features dark, uneven ground in the foreground and middle ground, interspersed with sparse, leafless trees, while hills form the background under a dim, overcast sky, suggesting a gloomy atmosphere. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, characterized by dim, diffused lighting. The shot remains static, with no changes in framing or subject position, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining deep focus throughout. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing the three individuals in protective gear in this bleak terrain. Both men in dark uniforms begin to walk to the right, passing by the man in the hazmat suit. The man in the hazmat suit continues to stand still, observing the surroundings, while the men in dark uniforms move further to the right, eventually exiting the frame. The scene conveys a sense of stillness and isolation, with no visible movement or activity beyond the figures' presence, emphasizing a sense of caution and preparedness for a hazardous environment.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus throughout. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing three individuals in protective gear in a desolate landscape.",
    "Subject": "The video features three men in a desolate, outdoor setting. Two of them are wearing dark military-style uniforms with helmets and face masks or guards, each holding a rifle. The man in the foreground, dressed in the uniform, appears to be gesturing with his left hand, while the other uniformed man is positioned in the left middle ground. The third individual, wearing an orange hazmat suit with a helmet and visor, is on the right, carrying a backpack and a device on his chest. The scene conveys a sense of caution and preparedness, with all three men equipped for a hazardous environment.",
    "Motion": "In a desolate, barren landscape, a man in a dark uniform and helmet raises his left hand while holding a rifle in his right hand, standing next to a man in an orange hazmat suit with a backpack. Another individual in a similar dark uniform is positioned further from the camera. Both men in dark uniforms begin to walk to the right, passing by the man in the hazmat suit. The man in the hazmat suit remains stationary, looking around as the others continue to walk away. The man in the hazmat suit continues to stand still, observing the surroundings, while the men in dark uniforms move further to the right, eventually exiting the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a desolate, barren landscape with sparse, leafless trees and a muted, overcast sky, suggesting a gloomy atmosphere. The ground is dark and uneven, possibly muddy. In the background, a vehicle is partially visible, blending into the somber environment. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, characterized by dim, diffused lighting. Three figures in protective suits are present: two in dark gear and one in an orange hazmat suit. They are equipped with gear and moving amidst the bleak terrain. The scene conveys a sense of stillness and isolation, with no visible movement or activity beyond the figures' presence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
