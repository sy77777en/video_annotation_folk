  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a grayscale emblem, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, against a dark wall in the background. A floor surface is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground all the way to the background, reaching the dark wall. An overlay text \"[36]\" is consistently visible in the bottom left corner, in the foreground. Initially, a spotlight from above illuminates the emblem, which is circular and depicts a hammer and a compass at its center, encircled by a wreath of wheat ears. At the base of the wreath, a tricolor ribbon, rendered in shades of gray, is visible. The spotlight reveals the emblem's detailed features, emphasizing its three-dimensional, metallic or stone-like texture and casting shadows. The camera maintains a level angle and deep focus with a large depth of field, slowly and smoothly dollying backward from the emblem. As the video progresses, the spotlight gradually dims, causing the centrally positioned emblem to fade from view and eventually disappear completely into the darkness. A faint light remains on the floor in the bottom center area after the emblem has vanished. The camera height is indeterminable due to a lack of background information.",

    "Subject": "The video features a grayscale emblem, centrally positioned against a dark, textured background. The emblem is circular and depicts a hammer and a compass at its center, encircled by a wreath of wheat ears. At the base of the wreath, a tricolor ribbon, rendered in shades of gray, is visible. The emblem is initially illuminated by a bright spotlight from above, creating highlights and shadows that give it a three-dimensional, metallic or stone-like appearance. As the video progresses, the spotlight gradually dims, causing the emblem to fade into the black background until it is no longer visible.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a dark emblem, which is gradually illuminated by a spotlight, revealing its detailed features including a hammer, compass, and wheat wreath. The spotlight continues to brighten the emblem, making it more visible and distinct against the dark background. As the spotlight dims, the emblem starts to fade, becoming less distinct and eventually disappearing into the darkness.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a grey, metallic emblem of East Germany, featuring a hammer and compass encircled by a wreath of rye, positioned centrally on a dark grey wall over a matching floor. A spotlight from above initially illuminates the emblem, emphasizing its three-dimensional texture and casting shadows. Throughout the video, this spotlight progressively dims, causing the emblem to fade into darkness until the scene is almost entirely black, with only a faint light remaining on the floor beneath where the emblem was highlighted. The overlay text \"[36]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a grayscale emblem, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, against a dark wall in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
