  "merged_caption": "This video features a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective at the bottom of a staircase, looking up. The stairs begin in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and recede into the middle ground and background towards the top-center. Two thin, black handrails extend from the foreground to the background, one on the left and one on the right, running diagonally upwards. The scene is framed by tiled walls on the left and right and a tiled ceiling at the top. Bright light emanates from the room above, located in the background at the top of the stairs. The camera, in a first-person point of view from a 3D game, begins at a low, eye-level angle, looking up a brightly lit staircase. It moves steadily forward and upward with slight unsteadiness, simulating a player ascending the stairs, causing the camera angle to transition from low to level. As the camera rises, the lower steps move out of the frame, and the handrails shift to the foreground before exiting the sides of the frame. The light source in the background grows larger, and as the camera nears the top, it tilts down slightly. The faint outline of a room with two small, dark square openings becomes visible within the light. The entire scene is illuminated from above by an intensely bright, white light, creating a foggy, ethereal glow. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, square, off-white tiles with a faint greenish hue. As the camera reaches the top, a relatively open space is revealed, characterized by high ceilings and expansive, minimalist design, enhancing the feeling of liberation and openness after the confined ascent. The scene is captured with mild barrel distortion and a deep focus, keeping the entire stairwell sharp.",

    "Camera": "This first-person point of view from a 3D game begins at a low, eye-level angle, looking up a brightly lit staircase. The camera moves continuously forward and upward with slight unsteadiness, simulating a player ascending the stairs. This movement causes the camera angle to transition from low to level. Near the top, the camera tilts down slightly. The scene is captured with mild barrel distortion and a deep focus, keeping the entire stairwell sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, ascending staircase. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and anticipation as the camera's perspective moves steadily upwards. The wide staircase is enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, flanked by simple, thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light floods the space from the top of the stairs, obscuring the destination and lending the scene an ethereal, almost otherworldly quality. As the camera reaches the top, a relatively open space is revealed, characterized by high ceilings and expansive, minimalist design, enhancing the feeling of liberation and openness after the confined ascent.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from a low-angle perspective at the bottom of a staircase. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, white tiles, flanked by simple black handrails. The camera moves steadily up the stairs toward an intensely bright, white light at the top, which creates a stark and minimalist atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves up a minimalist staircase within a hazy, enclosed stairwell. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, square, off-white tiles. Two thin, black, cylindrical handrails run parallel to the wide, light-colored steps. The entire scene is illuminated from above by an intensely bright, white light emanating from the space above the stairs, creating a foggy, ethereal glow. As the perspective ascends the stairs, the faint outline of another room becomes visible within the brilliant light, featuring two small, dark square openings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
