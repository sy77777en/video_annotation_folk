  "merged_caption": "In a black-and-white 2D animation set against a plain white background, a very long, stylized dachshund-like dog stretches diagonally from the middle of the right side of the frame to the bottom left corner. The camera remains completely static throughout the video. A large pair of scissors, drawn in a pencil sketch style, descends from the top of the frame to cut the dog's elongated body. As the scissors snip, the front segment of the dog grows hind legs and a tail, transforming into a new, complete dog that continues moving towards the bottom left. Simultaneously, the rear segment regenerates a head and front legs, remaining an elongated dog. This process repeats continuously, with the scissors repeatedly ascending and descending to cut the newly formed long dog, creating a continuous procession of shorter dogs that all walk in the same direction towards the bottom left. The rear body of the dog appears to extend indefinitely, only to be cut by the scissors again, ensuring a perpetual cycle of transformation and movement.",

    "Subject": "In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a cartoonish, dachshund-like dog with an extremely elongated body and short legs is shown. A large pair of scissors, also drawn in a pencil sketch style, repeatedly descends from the top of the scene to cut the long dog's body. Each time the scissors snip, the front segment of the dog develops two hind legs and a tail, forming a complete dog, while the rear segment regenerates a head and two front legs, creating another complete dog. The rear body appears to extend indefinitely, only to be cut by the scissors again. This cycle repeats, with all the newly formed dogs continuing to move forward in the original direction.",
    "Motion": "In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a very long, dachshund-like dog walks forward. A large pair of scissors descends from the top of the frame and cuts the dog's body. The front section of the dog then grows hind legs and a tail, becoming a shorter, complete dog that continues to walk forward. The rear section regenerates a head and front legs, becoming another long dog that also moves forward. This process repeats, with the scissors continuously descending to cut the newly formed long dog, creating a line of shorter dogs that all walk in the same direction.",
    "Scene": "In a black-and-white, hand-drawn animation set against a plain white background, a very long, stylized dachshund-like dog moves across the scene. From above, a large pair of scissors, also hand-drawn, descends and repeatedly snips the dog's elongated body. With each cut, the severed front portion transforms into a new, complete dog, while the rear portion regenerates a head and front legs, becoming another elongated dog. This cycle repeats continuously as the scissors keep descending, consistently creating new dogs, all of which proceed in the original direction.",
    "Spatial": "In a black-and-white 2D animation, a very long, stylized dog stretches diagonally from the middle of the right side of the frame to the bottom left corner. A large pair of scissors descends from the top of the frame to cut the dog's body. After each cut, the front segment becomes a new, complete dog that continues moving towards the bottom left, while the rear segment regenerates a head and remains an elongated dog. The scissors repeatedly ascend and descend to cut the dog again, creating a continuous procession of new dogs moving towards the bottom left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
