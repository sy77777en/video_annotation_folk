  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a fixed medium shot from a camera mounted on the front right hood of a matte blue sports car, positioning the car's hood in the bottom left and center foreground. Through the windshield, two helmeted individuals are framed in the center middle ground; the driver wears a multicolored helmet with prominent yellow, blue, and red sections, while the passenger wears a white helmet. The road extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the right, with distant, hazy mountains visible in the background across the top of the frame. The scene captures a drive along a paved road in a vast, arid landscape at either sunrise or sunset, with the clear sky transitioning from deep blue to a warm orange glow at the horizon. As the scene progresses, a silver or grey sports car with a large black rear wing and headlights on initially appears in the frame from the rear right but gradually falls behind the blue car. The blue car overtakes the silver car, continuing to pull ahead as both vehicles drive forward on the paved surface. The camera maintains a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle, keeping the entire scene in deep focus. It leads the blue car from the front, moving backward throughout the shot. At the end, it trucks left and pans right as the silver car appears on the right, ensuring the dynamic motion of the vehicles is captured while the two helmeted occupants inside the blue car remain seated throughout. The camera remains fixed at the subjects' level, providing a locked-on POV shot that highlights the movement and spatial relationships between the cars and the surrounding landscape.",

    "Camera": "This smooth, eye-level shot, captured with a level angle, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera leads the blue car from the front, moving backward throughout the shot. At the end, it trucks left and pans right as another car appears on the right.",
    "Subject": "The video features a matte blue sports car, viewed from a camera mounted on its front hood looking back towards the windshield. Inside the car, two people are visible from the shoulders up, both wearing helmets. The person in the driver's seat wears a multicolored helmet with prominent yellow, blue, and red sections. The person in the passenger seat wears what appears to be a white helmet. A second sports car, which is silver or grey, appears on the right. This car is distinguished by a large black rear wing and has its headlights on.",
    "Motion": "A silver sports car emerges from behind on the right of a moving blue sports car, the blue car then overtakes the silver car, continuing to pull ahead as both vehicles drive forward on a paved surface. The two helmeted occupants inside the blue car remain seated throughout.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from the side of a blue sports car captures a drive along a paved road in a vast, arid landscape at either sunrise or sunset. The camera's perspective remains fixed, showing the car's hood, windshield, and side mirror. Through the windshield, two people wearing helmets are visible. The clear sky transitions from deep blue to a warm orange glow at the horizon, silhouetting distant, hazy mountains. As the car moves forward, another silver sports car with a large rear wing appears on the right. The blue car overtakes the silver car and continues to pull ahead as both vehicles drive forward on the paved surface.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a fixed medium shot from a camera mounted on the front right hood of a blue car, positioning the car's hood in the bottom left and center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
