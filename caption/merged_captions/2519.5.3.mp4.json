  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot, a small, red, oblong object with a glossy finish and a rounded, somewhat flattened shape is positioned in the center-bottom-left of the frame, resting in the middle ground on a dark, textured surface. The object features a small, circular, silver-colored detail on its top surface, and one end has a distinct flat edge with a circular hole on the flat surface. The background is out of focus and dark, with a faint, curved red shape visible in the top center of the frame. The camera is positioned above the object, providing a high-angle view of the scene, and uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the red object in the midground. A soft light illuminates the red object from one side, casting a shadow on the ground beside it. The small, red object remains stationary on the dark surface throughout the video.",

The background is out of focus and dark, with a faint, curved red shape visible in the distance. A soft light illuminates the red object from one side, casting a shadow on the ground beside it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
