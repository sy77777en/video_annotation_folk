  "merged_caption": "This video features a close-up shot of a woman prominently positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, captured with a camera at eye level and a level angle. She has a medium to dark skin tone and is wearing a patterned headscarf that covers her hair, along with a dark-colored top with a light-colored collar. Her profile is visible, showing a calm expression. In the background, on the right side, a door is visible in a dimly lit room with warm, muted lighting that suggests a sunset setting, casting soft shadows and creating a cozy, intimate space. The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion, as the woman moves closer to the camera while speaking. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom center of the frame, displaying dialogue between two individuals: \"Is that you, Fardosa? -Yeah, mom. How was the party? -It was alright. I will tell you about it tomorrow. Okay, remember to pray.\" The text is white and clearly legible against the darker background, providing context to the interaction without being part of the physical scene. The lighting is warm and dim, casting soft shadows on her face. Her presence is central to the video, and she is engaged in a conversation. In the latter part of the video, she slightly turns her head to her left, and the camera captures the right side of her face. The camera remains level with the subject, and there are no significant changes in shot size during the clip. The scene includes overlay elements, specifically subtitles at the bottom of the screen, providing context to the interaction.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
