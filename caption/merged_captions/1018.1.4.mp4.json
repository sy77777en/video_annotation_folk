  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men in a compact kitchen area on a train, with the camera positioned at their eye level. Initially, the main subject, a man in a white short-sleeved shirt, dark vest with gold buttons, and a green cap with red text, stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame. He has a mustache, a watch on his left hand, and is actively gesturing with his hands. The secondary subject, a man in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, wearing a red Santa hat, is positioned slightly behind and to the left, holding a large bag and a cane. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, beginning with deep focus, capturing both men clearly. As the main subject moves closer to the center of the frame while taking the umbrella from the secondary subject, the focus shifts to shallow, keeping him sharp in the foreground while blurring the background and midground. The secondary subject then turns away and exits towards the left background, placing the large bag onto a counter behind him. The kitchen setting remains consistent throughout, with muted green walls, metal cabinets, and a window on the right side allowing natural daylight to enter, indicating it is daytime. The countertop with various kitchen items like plates and a kettle is positioned in the background relative to the subjects, suggesting a functional space. The camera remains completely static throughout, capturing the interaction without noticeable changes in angle or zoom, focusing on the exchange between the two men. The subtle changes in lighting suggest the train is in motion, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise calm atmosphere.",

    "Motion": "In a room with grey cabinets and a window, a man in a white shirt and dark-colored vest takes a cane from a man in a dark green cardigan and Santa hat. The man in the white shirt then appears to place the cane on a high surface off-screen. The man in the dark green cardigan turns around and seems to place the large bag he is holding onto a counter behind him.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors in a compact, utilitarian kitchen area on a train, with muted green walls and metal cabinets. Natural daylight streams in through a window on the right side, indicating it is daytime, and the subtle changes in lighting suggest the train is in motion. The environment includes a countertop with various kitchen items like plates and a kettle, indicating a functional space. The scene features two individuals, one wearing a Santa hat, adding a festive touch. The other person is dressed in a uniform with a vest and tie, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or changes in the setting aside from the gentle motion of the train.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
