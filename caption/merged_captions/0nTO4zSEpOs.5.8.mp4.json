  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor architectural scene, focusing on a descending escalator. The camera, positioned at eye level with a high angle, captures the full length of the escalator, which occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The escalator's handrails and steps are clearly visible, with the steps moving downward. On either side of the escalator, metal railings run parallel, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, the lower level of the building is visible, featuring a smooth floor and a few individuals near the base of the escalator. Potted plants line the right side of the frame in the middle ground, adding greenery to the otherwise sleek and modern environment. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the escalator, providing a clear view of the descent. The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an indoor setting within a modern building, featuring a descending escalator. The environment is brightly illuminated by artificial lighting, making it unclear whether it is daytime or nighttime. The scene includes sleek architectural elements, such as metal railings and smooth walls, with potted plants adding a touch of greenery along the sides. The escalator leads to a lower level, where a few individuals are visible, indicating a public or commercial space. Overlays are present, including a watermark in the lower left corner that reads \"VIRTUAL. JAPAN. TV.\" The overall atmosphere is clean and contemporary, with a focus on the movement down the escalator. As the camera moves, the visible portions of the railings and plants gradually decrease, maintaining a steady perspective on the architectural elements and the movement of the escalator.",

    "Camera": "The video features a first-person view shot with a camera at eye level and a high angle, looking down from above. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward and down while tilting down, capturing the descent of an escalator.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot. The focus is on the design and structure of the space, highlighting elements like the escalator, railings, and surrounding environment. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and layout rather than a specific object or person, showcasing the scale and aesthetic of the architecture.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a modern, well-lit indoor area with an escalator positioned in the center of the frame and a small area with some plants on the right side. The camera moves downward, revealing more of the escalator. As the camera continues to move down, a person appears at the bottom of the escalator and starts walking forward. Another person follows closely behind, also walking forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
