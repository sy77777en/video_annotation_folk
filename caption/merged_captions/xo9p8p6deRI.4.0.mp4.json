  "merged_caption": "This video showcases a top-down view of a stylized 2D map that fills the entire frame with no sense of camera angle or depth. The map features a white grid representing roads, with topographical lines on the right and a coastline on the left. A glowing red line starts in the top left and extends toward the center, tracing a route along a highway near the coast. From the end of this red line, a white dashed line traces a path toward the bottom right, leading to a red pin labeled \"ASCENSION CEMETERY\" in white, uppercase text. As the shot progresses, the end of the red line animates along the white dashed path, and the topographical lines on the right side of the frame gradually fade to black, leaving a featureless black area. Concurrently, the view gradually zooms in, revealing more details of the rendered 2D map. The red dot gradually moves along the white dashed path in a lower right direction towards the red pin. The land is depicted in dark gray, with mountainous terrain visible further inland, while the adjacent body of water is a slightly lighter gray.",

    "Subject": "This video displays a stylized map of a coastal area against a black background. The map features a grid of thin white lines representing roads, with topographical lines indicating mountains on the right side and a coastline on the left. A glowing red line traces a route from the upper left, moving towards lower right, ending in a moving red dot that follows a white dashed line towards the lower right side. The red line likely represents the path already traveled, while the dotted white line indicates the planned route. As the video progresses, the topographical lines representing mountains on the right side gradually disappear, leaving a featureless black area. The path leads to a red location pin labeled \"ASCENSION CEMETERY\" in white, uppercase text.",
    "Motion": "A glowing red line animates across a stylized map, tracing a route from the upper left in a lower right direction and concluding at a red dot. This red dot gradually moves along the white dashed path in a lower right direction towards the red pin. Concurrently, the topographical lines on the right side of the map fade away, leaving a plain black background.",
    "Scene": "A stylized, dark map displays a coastal region with a grid of white lines representing roads against a black background. A prominent, glowing red line traces a route along a highway near the coast. From this red path, a white dashed line extends along the coast, leading to a red pin. An overlay of white, capitalized text next to the pin identifies the location as \"ASCENSION CEMETERY.\" The land is depicted in dark gray, with mountainous terrain visible further inland, while the adjacent body of water is a slightly lighter gray.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
