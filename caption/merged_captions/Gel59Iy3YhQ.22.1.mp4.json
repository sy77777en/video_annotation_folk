  "merged_caption": "This wide shot shows a small, sandy island in the middle ground, centered within the frame and surrounded by turquoise water. A pixelated player character with brown hair and a green shirt stands in the upper-middle portion of the island, preparing to swing a \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE\" at a golf ball described as \"PLUGGED\" with a \"3Y RANGE,\" indicating it is embedded in the sand. The island features a central green with a yellow flag, several palm trees, and small bushes. The character swings the shovel, striking the golf ball out of the sand. The ball flies in a high arc from the upper-middle of the frame, hits the yellow flag in the hole, and falls in after the collision. The camera follows the ball's trajectory downward, capturing the dynamic moment when the ball hits the flagpost with a slight shake to enhance the impact. The character maintains the same posture after swinging the club. The scene is framed by a heads-up display. In the top left, information about the hole indicates it is the 6th hole, a par 3, with player scores listed below. In the top right, indicators for wind and slope are visible. The bottom of the screen displays the selected club, a \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE,\" a power meter, and information about the ball's lie, which is \"PLUGGED.\" The user interface also displays another player character with green hair and a green hat.",

    "Subject": "In a pixelated golf game set on a small, sandy island surrounded by water, a player character with brown hair and a green shirt prepares to take a shot. The selected golf club is atypical, appearing as a \"SHOVEL\" and labeled a \"DIGGING WEDGE.\" The golf ball is also in an unusual state, described as \"PLUGGED\" with a \"3Y RANGE,\" indicating it is embedded in the sand. The user interface displays another player character with green hair and a green hat. The island course itself is unconventional, featuring a small green, four palm trees, and several bushes.",
    "Motion": "A pixelated character swings a shovel, striking a golf ball out of the sand. The ball flies in a high arc, hits the yellow flag in the hole, and falls in after the collision. The character maintains the same posture after swinging the club.",
    "Scene": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art golf game set on a small, sandy island surrounded by turquoise water. The island features a central green with a yellow flag, several palm trees, and small bushes. A character in a green shirt swings a club, sending a white golf ball flying towards the hole on the green. The scene is framed by a heads-up display. In the top left, information about the hole indicates it is the 6th hole, a par 3, with player scores listed below. In the top right, indicators for wind and slope are visible.

    "Spatial": "This wide shot shows a small island in the middle ground, centered within the frame and surrounded by water. A player character stands in the upper-middle portion of the island, while the green and flag are located in the center. The player character swings a shovel, sending the golf ball from the upper-middle of the frame in an arc downward toward the flag in the center. The camera follows the ball's trajectory as it moves downward after being hit."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
