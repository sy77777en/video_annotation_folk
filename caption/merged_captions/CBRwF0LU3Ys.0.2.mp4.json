  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high, top-down angle, showing a rally-style car, which is white with red and blue markings, in the upper-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a pale sandy path marked with deep ruts from frequent vehicle use. This path curves through a vast desert landscape composed of large, rolling, golden-brown sand dunes bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning or late afternoon. As the car drives along the road, it drifts around a left-hand curve, kicking up a large plume of light-colored dust that trails behind it. The camera, a smooth aerial drone shot, starts from a bird's-eye view and descends while rolling counterclockwise, transitioning to a high, Dutch angle. As the car straightens its path and continues driving down a long, straight section of the road, the camera moves closer, transitioning to a wide shot. It tilts up slightly to follow the car from behind, maintaining a deep focus to keep the vast landscape sharp. The car remains centered in the frame as it proceeds down the straight section, with the dust cloud trailing behind it, creating a dynamic visual against the backdrop of the large, rolling sand dunes in shades of brown and tan, their curved ridges creating a pattern of light and shadow.",

    "Camera": "This smooth aerial drone shot tracks a racing car through a desert. Starting from a bird's-eye view, the camera descends while rolling counterclockwise, transitioning to a high, Dutch angle. As it nears the ground, it tilts up slightly to follow the car from behind. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the vast landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "An aerial view shows a rally-style car, which is white with red and blue markings, driving at speed along a pale sandy path marked with deep ruts from frequent vehicle use. The car kicks up a large plume of light-colored dust that trails behind it as it navigates the curves. The path cuts through a vast desert landscape composed of large, rolling, golden-brown sand dunes.",
    "Motion": "From an aerial perspective, a car drifts around a left-hand curve on a desert road, kicking up a large plume of dust. The car then straightens its path and continues driving down a long, straight section of the road, with the dust cloud trailing behind it.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of a vast desert landscape bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning or late afternoon. The scene is dominated by large, rolling sand dunes in shades of brown and tan, their curved ridges creating a pattern of light and shadow. A pale, sandy path with deep ruts from frequent vehicle use winds its way through the dunes. A single car drives along this path, kicking up a significant plume of light-colored dust as it navigates a bend.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high, top-down angle, showing a car in the upper-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a road that curves through a vast landscape of sand dunes. As the car drives along the road, kicking up a dust plume that trails behind it, the camera moves closer, transitioning to a wide shot. The camera then follows the car as it proceeds down a straight section of the road, keeping it centered in the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
