  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a middle-aged Black man in a US Army camouflage uniform in the right foreground. He stands in a dimly lit, modern command center, surrounded by other military personnel and a few civilians. The man, whose uniform features a \"U.S. ARMY\" tape, a name tape that appears to read \"BLAKE,\" a Ranger tab, and a star-in-a-circle patch on his left shoulder, initially looks slightly to his left. In the left foreground and middle ground, several men in various military uniforms, including a Black man with glasses and a white man with short hair, gather around a large, brightly illuminated map table, looking down at what appears to be a map or plan. The background and middle ground are populated by other individuals in both military and civilian attire, including a woman in uniform on the right. The room's primary light source comes from long, white fluorescent strips on the dark ceiling, and the overall color palette is muted, consisting of dark tones, grays, and the greens and browns of the uniforms, with the white table serving as the main visual anchor. The camera, positioned at an eye-level, level angle, smoothly pans right as the man turns his head to look directly forward with a serious expression and walks toward it, resulting in a medium close-up. In this final framing, the man is in the left foreground, while the surrounding people remain largely stationary in the middle ground and background. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in sharp focus while the background is blurred, creating a sense of a busy, operational environment filled with indistinct computer consoles.",

The other military personnel and civilians around him in the command center remain largely stationary, with some gathered around a lit table and others standing in the background.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit, modern command center. In the center of the room, a group of military personnel in various camouflage uniforms and a few civilians in dark suits are gathered around a large, brightly illuminated map table. The room's primary light source comes from long, white fluorescent strips on the dark ceiling. The background is filled with other people and indistinct computer consoles, creating a sense of a busy, operational environment.

    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a man in an Army uniform in the right foreground. In the left foreground and middle ground, a group of military personnel gathers around a brightly lit table. The background and middle ground are populated by other individuals in both military and civilian attire. The camera then pans right as the man walks toward it, resulting in a medium close-up. In this final framing, the man is in the left foreground, while the surrounding people are in the middle ground and background. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
