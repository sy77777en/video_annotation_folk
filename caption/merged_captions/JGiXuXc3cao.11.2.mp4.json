  "merged_caption": "The camera executes a slow and smooth counterclockwise roll while simultaneously zooming out, capturing a medium close-up of two men from the chest up. The two men depicted in the animated illustration remain completely still throughout the video. The man on the left is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame, while the second man sits slightly further back in the middle ground to his right. They are seated at a table, with the man on the right holding a mug. Both men appear stressed. The background features out-of-focus red and teal lights across the top of the frame, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' eye level. The man on the left, who has blondish-green hair in a bowl cut, leans forward with his head bowed. He presses his left hand to his forehead, covering his eyes, while his right hand holds a purple object resembling glasses. To his left, on the right side of the frame, sits another man with dark, neatly combed hair and glasses. This man holds a white mug in his right hand and covers his mouth and nose with his left hand as he looks down. This illustrated indoor scene is set at night, characterized by a dark, out-of-focus background with glowing red and teal lights. In the foreground, two men in yellow collared shirts are seated at a table. The scene is illuminated by a cool, teal-colored light from the right, casting highlights on the subjects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
