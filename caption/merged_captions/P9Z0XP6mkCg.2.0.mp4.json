  "merged_caption": "The video is filmed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, positioned from the left rear of a stylized, white humanoid figure with a smooth surface, which is blurred and occupies the right foreground with only the upper half of their body visible. The central focus is a black Sony computer monitor, positioned in the center middle ground and fully in view, displaying a Wikipedia article for \"Alan MacMasters,\" featuring a black-and-white portrait of a man with dark hair. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, moving forward slowly and smoothly toward the computer monitor. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground—specifically, the computer screen—in focus, while the foreground and background are softly blurred. The humanoid figure sits motionless at a wooden desk with its hands poised over a keyboard in front of the monitor. In the left middle ground, a sandwich on a small blue plate sits on the desk, and to the left of the monitor stands a black computer tower. A prominent light source, likely a lamp, is visible in the right middle ground, in front of the humanoid's right side. The entire scene is set against a blue curtain in the background. A text overlay reading \"wikipedia.org\" is fixed in the bottom left corner of the frame.",

    "Motion": "The camera slowly moves forward toward the screen, while a stylized white figure sits motionless at a desk with its hands poised over a keyboard in front of a computer monitor. The monitor, a sandwich on a plate, and the surrounding environment remain completely still.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a white, stylized figure sits at a wooden desk in a room.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
