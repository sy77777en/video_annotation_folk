  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, looking down a Venetian canal that occupies the center of the frame and extends from the foreground into the background. Historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades, arched windows, and terracotta roofs line both the left and right sides of the waterway, receding into the distance. The greenish-blue water of the canal is slightly choppy. The camera, positioned at a height above the water, offers a slightly unsteady, elevated perspective and moves backward along the canal with a smooth, handheld feel, incorporating a slight clockwise roll in the movement. In the center-right middle ground, a yellow and white water taxi prominently marked \"ALILAGUNA\" enters from the right side of the frame, moving in the opposite direction of the camera and steadily creating small ripples in the water as it progresses. Further in the center middle ground, a classic black gondola with its gondolier rows along the canal. Other smaller boats, including a blue one moored on the left, are visible along the banks. The sky is a uniform overcast grey, adding to the characteristic atmosphere of the scene. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the encompassing environment, capturing the architectural density and lively maritime activity of the iconic Venetian waterway, emphasizing its scale and unique urban fabric. The background remains consistent with the historic buildings and the calm water of the canal, while the scene is animated by the movement of the watercraft.",

    "Camera": "From an above-water, level-angle perspective, this shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire Venetian canal scene sharp. The camera moves backward along the river with a smooth, handheld feel, incorporating a slight clockwise roll in the movement.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot, offering a perspective down a wide Venetian canal. On either side, historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades, arched windows, and terracotta roofs press closely together, bordering the greenish-blue, slightly choppy water. The scene is animated by several watercraft: a yellow and white water taxi prominently marked \"ALILAGUNA\" traverses the middle ground, a classic black gondola with its gondolier glides further down the canal, and other smaller boats, including a blue one moored on the left, are visible. The sky is a uniform overcast grey. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the encompassing environment, capturing the characteristic atmosphere, architectural density, and lively maritime activity of the iconic Venetian waterway, emphasizing its scale and unique urban fabric.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a wide canal flanked by historic buildings on both sides, with several gondolas docked along the edges. The camera slowly moves backward, gradually revealing more of the buildings. A boat, labeled 'ALILAGUNA,' gradually enters from the right side of the frame and moves in the opposite direction of the camera, steadily creating small ripples in the water as it progresses. The background remains consistent with the historic buildings and the calm water of the canal.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, under an overcast sky. The greenish water of the canal is slightly choppy. Lining both sides of the waterway are historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades and numerous windows. Several boats are visible on the water. A white and yellow water taxi enters from the right side of the scene, while a gondola is rowed in the middle distance. Other gondolas and smaller boats are moored along the canal's edges.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, looking down a Venetian canal that occupies the center of the frame and extends from the foreground into the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
