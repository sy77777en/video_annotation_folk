  "merged_caption": "In a static shot taken from above, a light greenish-brown crocodile with scaly skin is positioned horizontally across the bottom of the frame, occupying about 60% of its width. Its front half rests on a muddy bank in the foreground, with its head near the bottom left, while its tail is submerged in the water to the right. A small, dark object floats on the water beside the crocodile on the bank and is also motionless. A small clump of earth and sparse vegetation sits on the bank in the left middle ground. In the middle ground, a second crocodile is partially visible on the right side of the frame, remaining stationary in the calm, green water that fills the center and background. The second crocodile is floating, with only the top of its head, bumpy back, and tail visible above the surface. The upper portion of the frame is filled with the blurry reflection of tall green reeds from the distant shore. This is a static, high-angle shot captured from hip level. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the crocodiles in the midground in sharp focus. The scene is set in a sunlit, natural environment, with the water reflecting the surrounding greenery. Both crocodiles remain completely still throughout the video, contributing to the serene atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "In the middle ground, a light greenish-brown crocodile with scaly skin lies at the water's edge, with the front half of its body resting on a muddy bank and its tail submerged. It is oriented towards the left, and a small, dark object is floating on the water beside the crocodile. Further back in the calm, green water, a second crocodile is stationary and floating, with only the top of its head, bumpy back, and tail visible above the surface.",
    "Motion": "Two crocodiles, one resting on a muddy bank and the other in the water, remain completely still throughout the video. A small object floats on the water beside the crocodile on the bank and is also motionless.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit, natural setting, a small, light-green crocodile with dark markings rests at the edge of a calm body of water, its body half on the sandy bank and half submerged. A second, similar crocodile remains still in the greenish water, its back and snout breaking the surface. The water reflects the blurry, tall green reeds that line the distant bank. Beside the first stationary crocodile, a small ball floats on the water. To the left, a small clump of earth and sparse vegetation sits on the shoreline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
