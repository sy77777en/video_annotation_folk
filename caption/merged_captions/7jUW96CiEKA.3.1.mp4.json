  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a hippopotamus is visible with its head above the water, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. The hippo moves slowly towards the right side of the frame, maintaining a relatively central horizontal position. The water occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, at the top of the frame, a river bank with green, grassy vegetation is visible. The camera is positioned above water at a high angle, looking down, with the focus clear in the midground, and it remains completely static with no movement or shaking. The hippopotamus, partially submerged in the calm, murky water, displays smooth, dark brown skin. Its eyes and ears are prominent, positioned high on the head, which is typical for a hippo, allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings. The hippo's head remains relatively stationary, with slight movements indicating it is either resting or slowly swimming. The water around the hippo is calm, reflecting the animal's stillness and suggesting it is either resting or slowly moving through the water. The scene is set outdoors, centered on a body of calm water, likely a river, with the water reflecting the light and creating a slightly hazy appearance. The time of day appears to be daytime.",

    "Subject": "The video features a hippopotamus partially submerged in water. The hippo's head is partially visible above the surface, displaying smooth, dark brown skin. Its eyes and ears are prominent, positioned high on the head, which is typical for a hippo, allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings. The water around the hippo is calm, reflecting the animal's stillness and suggesting it is either resting or slowly moving through the water.",
    "Motion": "A hippopotamus is seen in a body of water, with only its head and part of its back visible above the surface. The hippo's head remains relatively stationary, with slight movements indicating it is either resting or slowly swimming. The background consists of a calm water surface with some vegetation visible in the distance, suggesting a natural habitat.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene centered on a body of calm, murky water, likely a river. The water reflects the light, creating a slightly hazy appearance. Along the far bank, some green, grassy vegetation is visible. A hippopotamus is partially submerged in the water, with only its head and the top of its back visible. It is moving through the water, creating a gentle wake. The time of day appears to be daytime.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up shot, a hippopotamus is visible with its head above the water. Positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, the hippo moves slowly towards the right side of the frame, maintaining a relatively central horizontal position. The water occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, at the top of the frame, a river bank with vegetation is visible. The camera remains at the hippo's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
