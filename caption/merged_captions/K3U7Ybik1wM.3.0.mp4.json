  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a low-angle perspective, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. Initially, the entire frame is out of focus, but it gradually transitions to focus more on the foreground, where a moss-covered stone wall is positioned at the bottom of the frame. The wall is covered in yellow and green moss, and due to filters and post-editing effects, it has a trippy, ripple-like appearance, remaining not very sharp. In the background, a line of lush green trees stretches across the middle of the frame, blurred against a bright, overexposed sky occupying the top portion of the background. The camera, slightly unsteady, exhibits minor movement throughout the clip, adding a subtle dynamic element to the scene. The shot is from a level-angle, eye-level perspective, slightly looking upward past the top of the stone structure. The shallow depth of field and soft focus emphasize the natural textures, creating an atmospheric, almost abstract impression of a tranquil outdoor environment. The focus is on the overall mood and setting rather than a specific object or figure.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from a level-angle, eye-level perspective. Initially, the entire frame is out of focus, but it gradually transitions to focus more on the foreground. However, due to some distortion filters, the elements in the foreground remain not very sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, offering a close, out-of-focus perspective of a moss-covered stone wall in the foreground. Behind the wall, a line of lush green trees is blurred against a bright, overexposed sky. There is no distinct main subject; the shallow depth of field and soft focus emphasize the natural textures and create an atmospheric, almost abstract, impression of a tranquil outdoor environment. The focus is on the overall mood and setting rather than a specific object or figure.",
    "Motion": "This is a blurry, out-of-focus shot of a moss-covered stone structure in the foreground. In the background, a line of green trees stands against a bright, white sky. The camera exhibits some minor movement throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "The scene is depicted from a level-angle perspective, slightly looking upward, past the top of a stone structure covered in yellow and green moss. Initially, the view is blurry, but the focus shifts to the wall in the foreground. However, due to filters and post-editing effects that create a trippy, ripple-like appearance, the view remains not completely sharp. In the background, a line of green trees is visible against a bright, overcast sky.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a low-angle perspective, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. Initially, the entire frame is out of focus. The shot then pulls focus to a moss-covered stone wall positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a line of green trees remains blurred, stretching across the middle of the frame, with a bright sky occupying the top portion of the background. The camera makes slight movements during the focus shift, adding a subtle dynamic element to the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
