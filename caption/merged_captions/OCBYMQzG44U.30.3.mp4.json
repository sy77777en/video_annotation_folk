  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a level angle, positioning the viewer at the surface of murky green water that fills the bottom half of the frame. The camera is positioned just above the water, housed inside a transparent, ball-shaped cover, with water droplets on the cover obscuring the view and causing mild barrel distortion. In the background, white-tiled walls occupy the upper half, with several small, bright windows positioned near the top of the frame. In the first half of the video, multiple inflatable toys of various colors float in the water, both in the middle ground and background, while a water ripple is visible in the bottom foreground. The camera performs a smooth and quick pan to the right, pausing briefly before resuming its motion. As the camera pans, it reveals a red pipe entrance with a black interior on the center-right of the wall in the background. The environment is defined by stark, white-tiled walls under the bright, diffuse light of several small, high windows. The shot lacks a singular main subject, as the immersive viewpoint emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unsettling quality of the confined space itself. The focus is on the overall environment rather than on the dark, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground or the red pipe entrance with a black interior floating in the distance. The camera maintains a relatively stable position throughout the shot, capturing the motion of the murky green water.",

    "Camera": "This video is filmed from a camera positioned at a level angle just above the water, housed inside a transparent, ball-shaped cover. Water droplets on the cover obscure the view, making the focus indistinct, and the lens exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera performs a smooth and quick pan to the right, pausing briefly before resuming its motion.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an aquatic interior scenery shot, capturing a view from a level angle at the surface of murky, green water within an enclosed tank. The environment is defined by stark, white-tiled walls under the bright, diffuse light of several small, high windows. The shot lacks a singular main subject, as the immersive viewpoint emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unsettling quality of the confined space itself. The focus is on the overall environment rather than on the dark, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground or the red pipe entrance with a black interior floating in the distance.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from the water's surface inside what appears to be a pool or tank with white-tiled walls. The camera is enclosed within a transparent, ball-shaped cover, capturing the motion of the murky green water.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the surface of murky, greenish water within an enclosed space. The room's walls are lined with white rectangular tiles, and bright, diffuse light enters through several small, high windows. The water's surface is disturbed by ripples. There are several inflatable toys of various colors are visible in the middle ground and background. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals a red pipe entrance with a black interior on the distant wall.",
    "Spatial": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a level angle, positioning the viewer at the surface of murky green water that fills the bottom half of the frame. In the background, white-tiled walls occupy the upper half, with several small, bright windows positioned near the top of the frame. In the first half of the video, multiple inflatable toys of various colors float in the water, both in the middle ground and background. A water ripple is visible in the bottom foreground. In the latter half, a red pipe with a black interior is visible on the center-right of the wall in the background. The camera pans and maintains a relatively stable position throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
