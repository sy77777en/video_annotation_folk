  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot, featuring a shirtless young man with short brown hair and a silver chain necklace, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, holding an unlit hand-rolled cigarette to his lips. Flanking him in the dark background are two candelabras, one on the left and one on the right, each holding multiple lit white candles. A hand, identifiable by a white sleeve, enters the frame from the left foreground and moves towards the center, using a silver lighter in the foreground to light the man's cigarette, which remains in the center middle ground. The man then lifts his gaze from the cigarette and looks directly at the camera. He inhales from the lit cigarette, closes his eyes, and lowers the cigarette, then exhales a large plume of white smoke that billows from the center middle ground towards the foreground. As the camera zooms in, transitioning to a close-up shot that focuses on his face and the smoke, the camera continues to zoom in, ultimately concluding with an extreme close-up of the man’s lips and the drifting smoke. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle throughout, initially with a shallow depth of field, keeping the shirtless man in the middle ground in focus. As the camera moves forward towards the man, the focus transitions to an ultra-shallow depth of field, maintaining the man in focus. The camera movement is very smooth as it dollies forward, capturing the dynamics of the scene as the man interacts with the cigarette and the smoke, set against the dimly lit ambiance created by the candelabras.",

    "Subject": "The video features a shirtless young man with short brown hair and a silver chain necklace, who initially brings an unlit cigarette to his lips. Another person's hand, with a white sleeve visible, enters the frame and uses a silver lighter to light the cigarette. The man then inhales from the lit cigarette and exhales a large plume of white smoke. On either side of the man, in the dark background, are candelabras with lit candles.",
    "Motion": "A shirtless young man with short brown hair and a silver chain necklace is seen holding an unlit cigarette in his right hand. He brings the cigarette to his lips and prepares to light it. Another person's hand, wearing a white sleeve, appears and uses a silver lighter to ignite the cigarette. The man then lifts his gaze from the cigarette and looks directly at the camera. The man inhales from the lit cigarette and then closes his eyes and lowers the cigarette, and finally exhales a large plume of white smoke. The background is dark, with two candelabras on either side of the man, each holding five lit candles.",
    "Scene": "The video is set in a dark indoor environment, illuminated by two candelabras, each holding multiple lit white candles, positioned on either side of a shirtless young man. The man wears a silver chain necklace and initially brings an unlit hand-rolled cigarette to his lips. Another hand, identifiable by a white sleeve, enters the frame from the left and uses a silver lighter to ignite the cigarette. The man then inhales from the lit cigarette and exhales a plume of white smoke as the camera zooms in slightly, focusing on his face and the smoke.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
