  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle, full shot, a large yellow rubber duck with a smooth surface and a wide, open orange beak is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground within a white-tiled recess resembling a corridor filled with water. The duck, which has simple, round eyes with black pupils and white sclerae, looms over the viewer's perspective. A single circular light is visible in the top center background on the ceiling. The first-person camera, positioned below the subject, moves forward, tilting upward and panning right to focus on the rubber duck. As the camera approaches, it passes directly underneath the duck's open beak, simultaneously tilting upward to provide a view of the duck from a down-to-up perspective. This movement causes the duck to loom larger, with its lower part entering the foreground, and its body eventually fills more space in the bottom half of the frame, while its head and open beak are positioned in the upper center, dominating the view. The shot features mild barrel distortion and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The perspective shifts slightly, making the duck appear to move closer and fill more of the view, enhancing the sense of its size and presence within the white, tiled, rectangular space recessed into the wall.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, above-water level, the first-person camera moves forward, tilting upward and panning right to focus on a rubber duck. The shot features mild barrel distortion and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a low-angle perspective, a large, yellow rubber duck with a smooth surface is visible. The duck, which fills most of the view, has a wide, open orange beak and simple, round eyes with black pupils and white sclerae. It is situated within a white, tiled, rectangular space recessed into the wall.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle perspective, the camera moves forward, approaching a large, stationary yellow rubber duck. As the camera passes directly underneath the duck's open beak, it simultaneously tilts upward, providing a view of the duck from a down-to-up perspective.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set from a low angle inside a white-tiled structure resembling a corridor filled with water. A large, yellow rubber duck with a red-orange beak and wide eyes is positioned in the center, looming over the viewer's perspective. The walls are covered in a grid of small, white, glossy tiles, and a single, small, circular light is visible on the ceiling above. The perspective shifts slightly, making the duck appear to move closer and fill more of the view.",
    "Spatial": "From a low-angle, full shot, a large yellow rubber duck is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground within a white-tiled recess.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
