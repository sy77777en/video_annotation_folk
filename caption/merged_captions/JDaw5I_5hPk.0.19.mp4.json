  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where a paved, two-lane road occupies the foreground and middle ground, entering from the bottom of the frame and curving from the left toward the right. A dark-colored sedan is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, driving along the road toward the camera. The scene is dominated by a dense forest of towering, ancient redwood trees with massive, dark-barked trunks that fill the background and both the left and right sides of the frame, creating a cathedral-like atmosphere. Sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth of ferns and other foliage lining the roadside. A yellow and black striped chevron sign stands on a small embankment in the right middle ground, next to the road, indicating the curve. The camera is static and positioned at a low height on the side of the road, using a deep focus to keep the entire forest scene, from the road in the foreground to the towering trees in the background, in sharp detail. The slightly unsteady shot is filmed from an eye-level, level perspective, capturing the car in motion as it travels along the curve of the road. The presence of the sedan highlights the vastness of the surrounding trees, underscoring the grandeur of the landscape. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the majestic and immersive atmosphere of the ancient forest.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot filmed from an eye-level, level perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire forest scene, from the road in the foreground to the towering trees in the background, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is a forest scenery shot depicting a paved, two-lane road curving through a dense redwood forest. Massive, ancient redwood trees with thick, dark trunks tower over the scene, their immense scale creating a cathedral-like atmosphere as sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth. A dark-colored sedan drives along the road, its presence highlighting the vastness of the surrounding trees. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the majestic and immersive atmosphere of the ancient forest. The composition emphasizes the scale of the natural environment rather than any specific object within it. The car acts as a point of reference, underscoring the grandeur of the landscape.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a car on a paved road winding through a majestic forest of giant trees. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, illuminating the lush greenery and the vehicle. The car is in motion, traveling along the curve of the road.",
    "Scene": "A paved, two-lane road with yellow center lines curves through a dense forest of towering trees with massive, dark-barked trunks. Sunlight filters through the thick green canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the asphalt and the lush undergrowth of ferns and other foliage lining the roadside. A yellow and black striped chevron sign stands on a small embankment on the right, indicating the curve. A dark-colored sedan is seen driving along the road, approaching from around the bend.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide scenery shot where a paved, two-lane road occupies the foreground and middle ground, entering from the bottom of the frame and curving from the left toward the right. A dark-colored sedan is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, driving along the road toward the camera. The scene is dominated by a dense forest of towering trees that fill the background and both the left and right sides of the frame, with a particularly massive tree trunk standing in the right middle ground. On a small embankment in the right middle ground, next to the road, is a yellow and black striped sign. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting patches of light and shadow across the road and the surrounding foliage. The camera is static and positioned at a low height on the side of the road."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
