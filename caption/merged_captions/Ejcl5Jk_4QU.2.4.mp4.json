  "merged_caption": "In a dimly lit, dark indoor setting with greenish-yellow lighting, a close-up shot frames a person's face in profile on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. The person is wearing a transparent plastic nebulizer mask that covers their nose and mouth, secured by a thin strap along the cheeks. Attached to the front of the mask is a translucent, cylindrical nebulizer chamber, which extends towards the right side of the frame, occupying the center and right foreground. The background remains completely dark and out of focus. The camera, positioned at the subject's level with a slight upward tilt, employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground, specifically on the person wearing the nebulizer mask, while the most foreground elements are slightly blurred. The person's skin appears moist, and a small amount of condensation is visible inside the mask. As the person gradually lifts their head and exhales, a small wisp of vapor briefly emanates from the mask's apparatus in the center of the frame, adding subtle movement to the close-up shot. The scene is dimly lit with a greenish-yellow light, casting reflections on the mask and the person's skin, while the background remains in shadow. The shot includes a very smooth, slight upward tilt, enhancing the focus on the nebulizer mask and the person's face.",

    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting with greenish-yellow lighting, a person is shown in a close-up profile view. Their skin appears moist. They are wearing a transparent plastic nebulizer mask that covers their nose and mouth, secured by a thin strap along the cheeks. Attached to the front of the mask is a translucent, cylindrical nebulizer chamber.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, indoor setting, a close-up shot focuses on a person's face partially covered by a clear, translucent plastic medical mask. The scene is dimly lit with a greenish-yellow light, casting reflections on the mask and the person's skin, while the background remains in shadow. The mask, which covers the nose and mouth, is secured by a dark strap and connects to a multi-part plastic apparatus. A small amount of condensation is visible inside the mask, and a brief wisp of vapor emanates from it.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a person's face is framed in profile on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. A transparent nebulizer mask covers their nose and mouth, also positioned in the foreground on the left. Extending from the mask towards the right side of the frame is a cylindrical nebulizer chamber, which occupies the center and right foreground. The background is completely dark and out of focus.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
