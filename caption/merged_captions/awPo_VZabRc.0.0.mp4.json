  "merged_caption": "The video utilizes a wide shot at the subjects' level, viewed from outside a moving, light blue-grey subway car. Initially, an elderly woman with short, curly white hair, wearing a brown top and a dark skirt, is seated towards the center-right in the middle ground on an orange bench. Standing passengers, including a tall man with a long dark beard in a light green t-shirt and dark pants, and a man with spiky brown hair seen from the back in a green t-shirt, are positioned to her left and slightly more towards the foreground within the middle ground. The camera is at eye level and a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. Initially stationary, the camera begins to truck smoothly to the right after the subway starts moving horizontally from left to right, adjusting to match the speed of the subway, which makes the interior of the train appear relatively stationary within the frame. The perspective then shifts steadily to the right, revealing successive groups of passengers inside the train, all in the middle ground. Throughout this rightward progression, out-of-focus columns and, at intervals, larger riveted train pillars pass from right to left in the immediate foreground, periodically interrupting the view of the passengers. This movement sequentially frames different individuals and groups: first, passengers including a man in a grey fedora and dark jacket and another in a black baseball cap worn backwards, a dark green jacket, and ripped jeans; then, after a foreground pillar passes, a man in a light green hoodie with a graphic, a black baseball cap, and blue pants, and another in a dark suit; and finally, following another pillar, a pale-skinned man in a black jacket over a white t-shirt and dark pants and an overweight man in a pink, belly-exposing shirt and light blue pants, all observed through the train windows.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. Initially stationary, the camera begins to truck smoothly to the right after the subway starts moving, adjusting to match the speed of the subway, which makes the interior of the train appear relatively stationary within the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video shows various animated characters inside a train car, viewed from the outside as the train passes. As the camera starts moving to the right, the foreground outside the window consistently shows passing columns that are out of focus due to the subway's motion. An elderly woman with short, curly white hair, wearing a brown top and a dark skirt, is seated on an orange bench. Nearby, a tall man with a long dark beard, clad in a light green t-shirt and dark pants, stands holding an overhead rail, partially obscuring another man in a dark suit. A man with spiky brown hair, seen from the back in a green t-shirt, is sitting. As the view shifts, other seated passengers appear: a man in a grey fedora and dark jacket; a man with a black baseball cap worn backwards, a dark green jacket, and ripped jeans; and a man with dark hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a dark suit. Another seated man wears a light green hoodie with a graphic, a black baseball cap, and blue pants, his mouth agape. A pale-skinned man with dark messy hair, dressed in a black jacket over a white t-shirt and dark pants, sits with his legs spread. Finally, an overweight man in a pink, belly-exposing shirt and light blue pants is seen seated. Standing passengers include a woman with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a tan jacket, and another individual with a pink backpack.",
    "Motion": "The animated scene begins with a stationary camera capturing the exterior view of a train car moving horizontally from left to right. As the scene progresses, the camera starts to move to the right at a speed slower than the train, revealing the interior and passengers. Inside the passing train, various characters are depicted, most of whom remain stationary, either seated on orange benches or standing. As the train advances, subsequent sections of the car and different groups of seated or standing passengers slide into and then out of view. Throughout this, out-of-focus vertical columns in the immediate foreground consistently pass by, underscoring the train's continuous motion.",
    "Scene": "The video shows the exterior of a moving, light blue-grey subway car. Rectangular windows offer glimpses into the interior, where animated passengers are seated on orange seats. The subway car's metallic surface features visible rivets. Outside the windows, columns continuously pass by in the foreground, while the greyish blur of the subway car itself indicates movement during an overcast day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
