  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a subway station, focusing on a man with short hair wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes as he passes through the turnstiles. The man is positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, moving towards the center. As he approaches the turnstile, he swipes what might be his subway ticket and moves towards the area indicated for \"Red Line trains.\" The setting is clearly a subway station, with signage above the turnstiles guiding passengers. Initially, a tiled pillar with blue and white patterns is on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while the turnstiles are centered in the middle ground. As the camera moves closer, the pillar goes out of sight, and the turnstiles shift to the foreground, occupying almost the whole frame. Above the turnstiles, a red sign reading \"Red Line trains\" is prominently displayed in the upper part of the frame. The camera features a smooth forward-moving motion at eye level, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The environment is dimly lit, making it difficult to determine whether it's day or night. The station has a utilitarian design with tiled walls, including pillars covered with blue tiles, and fluorescent lighting. As the man goes through the turnstile, he continues to the right and eventually becomes obscured from view. The camera maintains a consistent perspective at the subject's level, capturing the station's interior through the turnstiles as the man exits the frame, adding a sense of human presence to the otherwise mechanical and structured environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with short hair passing through the turnstile. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. ",
    "Motion": "The video shows a man with short hair approaching a turnstile in a subway station. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes. Before passing through the turnstile, he swipes what might be his subway ticket. As he reaches the turnstile, he moves towards the area indicated for \"Red Line trains.\" The setting is clearly a subway station, with signage above the turnstiles guiding passengers.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an indoor setting within a subway station, focusing on the entrance to the Red Line trains. The environment is dimly lit, making it difficult to determine whether it's day or night. The scene features turnstiles and a prominent red sign indicating the train line. The station has a utilitarian design with tiled walls, including pillars covered with blue tiles, and fluorescent lighting. A person is seen passing through the turnstiles, adding a sense of human presence to the otherwise mechanical and structured environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
