  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in a wide shot from a high-angle, aerial perspective, looking down on the action in a third-person 3D gaming video. Initially, a small, dark-cloaked figure holding a glowing red sword is positioned in the bottom-center-left of the middle ground within a large, illuminated area on a dark blue surface scattered with red rocks. In the lower-center, a goat-like creature stands, while in the background, another goat-like creature is visible at the top-center, alongside a floating blue, triangular creature holding a stick. A blue projectile with a white trail flies to the lower left. The cloaked figure moves from the lower left toward the upper center in a counterclockwise arc, generating a large, glowing red crescent shape every time it attacks the goat-like creatures. The floating blue creature disappears from the top-center shortly after the video starts. Two goat-like figures, clad in tan attire and distinguished by large, white, crescent-shaped horns, throw their crescent-shaped weapons, which travel like boomerangs. Before the cloaked figure performs the second attack, another blue projectile flies across the screen from the bottom right. A second projectile is fired from the bottom right side in the latter part of the video. The camera loosely follows the player's avatar, with noticeable shaking when monsters hit the ground, and incorporates deep focus. A game HUD overlay is present in the top-left corner throughout, featuring a green health bar, four white diamond-shaped icons, and four icons to the left of them. A green glowing object provides additional light from the upper portion of the illuminated area, and white, air-like fragments are scattered around the weapons of the prominent figures.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, aerial perspective, the camera loosely follows the player's avatar. The shot is slightly unsteady, with noticeable shaking when monsters hit the ground, and incorporates deep focus.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, high-angle scene, several stylized humanoid figures are depicted on a dark blue surface covered with red rocks. The most prominent figures are brown, goat-like creatures clad in tan attire, distinguished by large, white, crescent-shaped horns or headpieces. Among them is a small, dark figure in a dark cloak holding a glowing red sword. Initially, a floating, purple, squid-like creature with tentacles is visible, but it disappears shortly thereafter. The scene features two bright blue, glowing projectiles leaving a white smoke trail, likely created by another dark figure hidden on the right side. White, air-like fragments are scattered around the weapons of the prominent figures. Large, glowing red crescent shapes materialize when the small dark figure with the glowing red sword attacks. Initially, a floating, blue, triangular creature holding a stick is visible.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle perspective, a blue projectile with a white trail flies to the lower left across a dark blue surface. A small, dark-cloaked figure holding a glowing red sword moves from the lower left toward the upper center in a counterclockwise arc. Two goat-like figures throw their crescent-shaped weapons, which travel like boomerangs. The cloaked figure attacks both goat-like figures sequentially, creating large, glowing red crescent shapes with each attack. Before it performs the second attack, another blue projectile flies across the screen from the bottom right.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D gaming video with a high-angle, aerial view shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene takes place in a dark, cavernous setting with a flat, dark blue floor, illuminated by a large, irregularly shaped spotlight. The ground within the light is scattered with red rocks. Throughout the sequence, stylized characters move and fight, generating visual effects like a glowing red crescent shape, a blue projectile with a white smoke trail, and white, spiky impact flashes. A green glowing object provides additional light from the upper portion of the illuminated area. An overlay in the top-left corner displays a heads-up display (HUD) featuring a green health bar, four white diamond-shaped icons, and four icons to the left of them.",
    "Spatial": "The scene is captured in a wide shot from a high-angle, aerial perspective, looking down on the action. Initially, a small, dark-cloaked figure is positioned in the bottom-center-left of the middle ground within a large, illuminated area. In the lower-center, a goat-like creature stands, while in the background, another goat-like creature is visible at the top-center, alongside a floating blue creature. A blue projectile travels towards the bottom-left. As the sequence progresses, the cloaked figure, holding a glowing red sword, moves upward toward the top of the frame, generating a large, glowing red crescent shape every time it attacks the goat-like creatures. The floating blue creature disappears from the top-center shortly after the video starts. A second projectile is fired from the bottom right side in the latter part of the video.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
