  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a young woman with long, light brown hair on a skateboard in the center foreground of the frame. She is wearing a beige, oversized, short-sleeved t-shirt over light-wash blue pants, black knee pads, and a blue, white, and red helmet with the \"Red Bull\" logo visible. Positioned on a large half-pipe, the curved ramp wall extends from the bottom foreground into the upper middle ground. In the background, palm trees and metal scaffolding are visible beneath an overcast sky. The camera, held by the woman at her own level, moves with her as she skates from left to right along the ramp. As she glides up the curved wall of the skate ramp, she holds the camera in her outstretched right hand to film herself, glancing over her shoulder with a slight smile. The ramp wall and the word \"BOOSTED,\" stenciled in black capital letters, slide past her toward the left, while she remains consistently in the center of the frame. From a slightly unsteady, eye-level selfie perspective, the camera leads her from the front as she passes a vertical ramp and rides down the wall in a clockwise arc. The camera angle, which has a varying Dutch angle, shifts from high to level during the movement. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as she continues her upward and downward trajectory along the ramp's surface.",

    "Subject": "A young woman with long, light brown hair is on a skateboard. She is wearing a beige, oversized, short-sleeved t-shirt over light-wash blue pants and has black knee pads on both knees. On her head, she wears a blue, white, and red helmet with the \"Red Bull\" logo visible on both the side and the front, and the chin strap is fastened. She looks over her shoulder toward the camera, which she holds out in her extended right hand, and has a slight smile on her face.",
    "Motion": "A young woman on a skateboard glides up the curved wall of a skate ramp. While holding a camera in her outstretched hand to film herself, she glances over her shoulder as she continues her upward and downward trajectory along the ramp's surface.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a skateboarder moving along the curved wall of a large outdoor half-pipe during the daytime. The ramp is made of brown-colored panels, with the word \"BOOSTED\" stenciled in black capital letters on its surface. In the background, multiple palm trees and metal scaffolding are visible beneath an overcast sky. The skateboarder wears a blue and white helmet featuring a \"Red Bull\" logo as they glide along the structure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
