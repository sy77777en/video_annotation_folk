  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a misty coastal landscape. The camera is positioned just above sea level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the waves in the foreground to the distant sea stacks, sharp and clear. The foreground is composed of calm, blue water occupying the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, gentle waves with white crests roll onto a wide, sandy beach that stretches across the scene. The background is dominated by large, mist-shrouded cliffs and dark, jagged rock formations that occupy the right and central portions of the frame, creating a sense of depth. The entire scene is enveloped in a soft, diffuse light, creating a muted color palette dominated by shades of blue and gray. Four small, distant figures are visible in the background on the left, standing near several dark sea stacks, accentuating the vastness of the natural setting. The scene is characterized by a thick haze that softens the details, creating an ethereal atmosphere. The focus is on the immense scale and serene mood of the environment, with the static shot capturing the gentle waves lapping at the shore.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire coastal scene, from the waves in the foreground to the distant sea stacks, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a vast and misty coastline. The scene is characterized by a muted, blue-gray color palette and a thick haze that softens the details, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Gentle waves with white crests wash over a wide, sandy beach, while in the distance, the dark, jagged silhouettes of large sea stacks and cliffs rise from the water and shore. The focus is on the immense scale and serene mood of the environment, with a couple of tiny, distant figures on the beach serving only to accentuate the vastness of the natural setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a static, scenic shot of a misty beach. Large rock formations are visible along the coastline and in the water, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. A few small figures can be seen walking in the distance.",
    "Scene": "A hazy, coastal landscape features a wide, sandy beach where gentle waves with white foam roll onto the shore. The foreground shows calm, blue water. In the distance, several large, dark rock formations and cliffs rise from the sea and the coastline, their silhouettes softened and layered by a thick mist. A few small, distant figures can be seen walking on the sand near the water's edge. The entire scene is enveloped in a soft, diffuse light, creating a muted color palette dominated by shades of blue and gray.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
