  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot taken from below the subjects' level, the focus of the scene is on the equestrian statue that occupies the center of the frame and stands in the middle ground. The walls of the Fisherman's Bastion extend across the background with its conical towers on the left and right. The foreground and middle ground are filled with numerous people, whose movements are captured as motion blurs. In a time-lapse shot, a crowd of people moves rapidly through a large plaza. The individuals, appearing as colorful blurs, walk in various directions, creating a constant, fluid stream of activity as they traverse the open space in front of the background architecture. This time-lapse video captures a bustling square with significant motion blur on the moving people. The camera, positioned at eye-level, executes a quick and smooth forward dolly, approaching a central statue. As it moves, the camera tilts up, transitioning from a level to a low angle to keep the statue in the frame. The shot appears to be in deep focus, with the background architecture remaining relatively clear despite the motion blur of the people in front of it. In a large, open plaza, a prominent green equestrian statue of a figure on a horse stands in the center middleground, with buildings visible behind it. Numerous people fill the plaza, their movements appearing sped-up due to the time-lapse effect. The crowd is a blur of activity, with many individuals wearing vibrantly colored shirts and a mix of long pants, shorts, and dresses. A daytime scene unfolds at the Fisherman's Bastion in Budapest, set within a spacious, paved courtyard. A few green trees are visible within the courtyard, and the background shows a pale blue sky with wispy clouds.",

    "Scene": "A daytime scene unfolds at the Fisherman's Bastion in Budapest, set within a spacious, paved courtyard. The prominent white stone structure, serving as a majestic backdrop to the central equestrian statue, features distinctive conical towers with pointed roofs and arched openings. This architectural marvel, with its intricate design and historical significance, frames the large, green-patinated bronze equestrian statue mounted on a stone pedestal. Pedestrians move throughout the plaza, their figures rendered as motion blurs against the static architecture. A few green trees are visible within the courtyard, and the background shows a pale blue sky with wispy clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
