  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of an orange, puffy down jacket hanging vertically, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The jacket appears inflated, with the hood section visible and a small, white, triangular logo on the chest area. Behind it, hazy, distant mountains are visible across the background, with an overcast, grey sky filling the upper portion of the background. The camera is at a level angle and gradually moves closer to the jacket, zooming in with a shallow depth of field, keeping the orange object in the foreground in focus. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the camera zooms in, the jacket's hood and hem gently sway in the breeze, enhancing the sense of motion against the mountainous landscape under the cloudy sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
