  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a high-angle perspective, looking down a pole vaulting pole at a light-skinned woman with long, dark hair tied in a ponytail, positioned directly below in the center foreground. She is wearing a red sports top and black shorts, holding a pole vaulting pole marked with white tape and a pink sticker bearing the number \"45.\" A large red and white landing mat occupies the middle ground, with a red running track and green field visible in the background. As the woman leans backward while on the large red landing mat, the camera, mounted on the end of the pole, moves forward, then tilts down, pans left, and rolls counter-clockwise with her motion. This movement causes the view to rotate, transitioning the framing to a medium shot, revealing her face and athletic torso as she remains in the center foreground. Her body transitions from a mostly upright position to one nearly parallel with the ground, where the video ends. Throughout the video, the landing mat remains visible in the frame, while the entire background scene, including the field and track, rotates around the central axis of the pole. The shot begins at a high angle from an overhead height and transitions to a bird's-eye view, with a varying Dutch angle caused by the camera's roll. The video features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video concludes while she is still in the air, offering a rotating view of the green turf infield, the surrounding red running track, and the pole vault standards. In the background, various buildings and a fence line the perimeter of the facility.",

    "Camera": "This locked-on perspective shot is captured from a camera mounted on the end of a pole vault pole, following a female athlete's jump. The camera moves forward, then tilts down, pans left, and rolls counter-clockwise as she flies across the pole in mid-air. The shot begins at a high angle from an overhead height and transitions to a bird's-eye view, with a varying Dutch angle caused by the camera's roll. The video features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned woman with long, dark hair tied in a ponytail is seen from a fixed perspective as she holds a pole vaulting pole. She is wearing a red sports top and black shorts. The video captures her leaning backward with her hands gripping the pole. The pole has white tape wrapped around the grip area and a pink band with the white number \"45\" on it. As she leans back, her face and athletic torso come into full view, and the video ends when her body is approximately parallel to the ground.",
    "Motion": "From a perspective fixed to a pole vaulting pole, a woman holding the pole leans backward while on a large red landing mat. As she leans, the pole and the attached camera tilt back with her, causing the view to rotate. This movement brings her face and torso into full view as her body transitions from a mostly upright position to one nearly parallel with the ground, where the video ends.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a pole vaulting pole captures the action at an outdoor athletics field on a clear day. The camera is aimed down the length of the pole, which is marked with white tape and a pink sticker bearing the number \"45.\" As the athlete leans back during the vault, the pole and attached camera rotate with her, bringing her face and torso into full view. Her body transitions from a mostly upright position to nearly parallel with the ground. The video concludes while she is still in the air, offering a rotating view of the green turf infield, the surrounding red running track, and the pole vault standards. In the background, various buildings and a fence line the perimeter of the facility.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
