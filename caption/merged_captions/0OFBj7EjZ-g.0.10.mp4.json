  "merged_caption": "The video features two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, positioned in the foreground in front of a large aquarium. The subject on the right, a woman, occupies the full frame height and is located on the right side. The central subject, a child, is positioned slightly to the right of center in the lower part of the frame. Both subjects are facing away from the viewer, observing colorful fish swimming dynamically from left to right in the middle ground. The background consists of a building structure visible through the aquarium glass, suggesting an indoor setting. The camera is positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, focusing on the figures in the foreground. It smoothly moves upward while tracking the figures from behind, ensuring steady and fluid motion without any shaking. A group of colorful fish begins to swim from the left side of the frame towards the right, maintaining their distance from the subjects. The fish continue to swim past, creating a dynamic scene as they move across the frame. Eventually, the fish swim out of the frame, leaving the subjects still standing and watching. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects appearing to move upward, possibly because the platform they are on is ascending, as they watch the aquatic life. Through the glass, the background reveals a building, adding depth to the setting. On the right side of the frame, there is an irregularly shaped object resembling a rock. The aquarium is set against a tiled wall, suggesting an indoor location, possibly a public aquarium or museum exhibit. The lighting is dim, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. In the lower left corner of the frame, there is an overlay text \"[4]\".",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the figures in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves upward while tracking the figures from behind, ensuring steady and fluid motion without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects appearing to move upward, possibly because the platform they are on is ascending, as they watch the aquatic life.",
    "Motion": "The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, standing in front of a glass aquarium. A group of colorful fish begins to swim from the left side of the frame towards the right, maintaining their distance from the subjects. The fish continue to swim past, creating a dynamic scene as they move across the frame. Eventually, the fish swim out of the frame, leaving the subjects still standing and watching.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a scene from an objective perspective, showcasing two figures standing in front of a large glass aquarium filled with various fish swimming inside. Through the glass, the background reveals a building, adding depth to the setting. On the right side of the frame, there is an irregularly shaped object resembling a rock. The aquarium is set against a tiled wall, suggesting an indoor location, possibly a public aquarium or museum exhibit. The lighting is dim, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The two figures appear to be observing the fish, with one figure slightly smaller and closer to the foreground, while the other stands taller and further back. In the lower left corner of the frame, there is an overlay text \"[4]\". The overall setting is calm and focused on the interaction between the individuals and the aquatic life.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
