  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young adult woman with fair skin and wet, blonde hair is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, framed within the opening of a transparent sliding door that provides an unobstructed view of a vibrant harbor at sunset, with a greenish-yellow sky over a waterfront lined with buildings, palm trees, and docked boats. Reflections of the same scene are visible on the door panels to the left and right in the middle ground. The woman, wearing a dark blue, low-cut, one-piece swimsuit, opens the door, steps inside, and closes it behind her. As she enters, she holds a light-colored towel in her left hand, using it to wipe from her left cheek to the ends of her shoulder-length hair. After entering, she turns slightly to her right, facing forward with her head turned slightly to her right. She pulls the door panel on her right towards the left to close it, while staying centered in the frame. A subtle lens flare appears on the left side of the frame, with a blurred indoor object in the lower right foreground. The camera is filmed from a fixed, eye-level position, maintaining a level angle, and is slightly unsteady, suggesting a non-stabilized setup. A deep focus is used, creating a large depth of field that keeps both the woman in the center and the background in focus.",

The woman opens the door, enters, and then closes it behind her.

    "Motion": "A woman in a blue swimsuit opens a door, steps inside, and closes it behind her. Facing forward, she holds a light-colored towel in her left hand, using it to wipe from her left cheek to the ends of her shoulder-length blonde hair. After entering, she turns slightly to her right.",
    "Scene": "The scene is viewed from a brightly lit interior, featuring a translucent sliding door in the midground. As the woman slides the door open, a vibrant harbor at sunset becomes visible, with a greenish-yellow sky over a waterfront lined with buildings, palm trees, and docked boats. Through the unopened translucent section of the door, a deeper and softer reflection of the same harbor is visible. A woman in a blue swimsuit, with wet hair clinging to her shoulders, stands framed by the open gap. She uses a cream-colored towel to dry her face and hair while pulling the door shut behind her. A subtle lens flare appears on the left side of the frame, with a blurred indoor object in the lower right foreground.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, framed within the opening of a transparent sliding door that provides an unobstructed view of a harbor scene with docked boats. Reflections of the same scene are visible on the door panels to the left and right in the middle ground. As the woman enters, she pulls the door panel on her right towards the left to close it, while staying centered in the frame. There is a subtle lens flare on the left side of the frame, and a blurred indoor object is visible in the lower right foreground. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
