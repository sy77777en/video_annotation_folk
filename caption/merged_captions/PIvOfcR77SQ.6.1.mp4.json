  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a serene small town in a winter setting during twilight, featuring a snow-covered landscape extending into the distance. Initially, a red building with a sloped roof is positioned in the right foreground, adding a splash of color to the predominantly white environment. A snow-covered path extends from the bottom left foreground into the background, with small, lit lanterns placed along the path. In the middle ground, several bare trees and yurts are visible to the left, with a line of dark hills spanning the background. The camera, positioned at eye level with a wide-angle lens, begins with a slow, steady pan to the right, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. As the camera pans, the initial red building shifts to the left side of the frame, revealing a red house with a lit lantern along the eaves and some sleds leaning against it. Further movement reveals a small, illuminated Christmas tree near the house and a signpost. The camera continues to pan right, showing more of the red house and additional sleds, then accelerates its panning as it moves forward, maintaining smooth and quick motion. This movement reveals more buildings with sloped roofs, some red and some gray, blending into the snowy backdrop. A second red building appears in the right middle ground, framing a wide, snowy area that fills the center. The scene features a few bare trees scattered across the snowy terrain, their branches silhouetted against a cloudy sky. Warm light emanates from small light bulbs on the roof of the initial red building, creating a cozy contrast to the cold surroundings. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the winter scene.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot using a wide-angle lens, which captures a broad field of view. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera begins with a slow, steady pan to the right, then accelerates its panning as it moves forward, maintaining smooth and quick motion throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a serene small town in a winter setting, featuring a few red houses covered in snow and a small Christmas tree adorned with lights, highlighting the cozy atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a snowy landscape at dusk, featuring a path covered in snow with several trees in the background and a few buildings in the distance. As the camera pans to the right, a red house with a lit lantern along the eaves and some sleds leaning against it comes into view. The camera continues to pan right, revealing more of the red house and additional sleds. Further movement reveals a small, lit Christmas tree near the house and a signpost. The camera then shows more of the snowy area, including another building with a lit Christmas tree.",

Initially, a red building is positioned in the right foreground, with a snow-covered path extending from the bottom left foreground into the background. Small, lit lanterns are placed in the foreground and middle ground along the path. In the middle ground, several bare trees and yurts are visible to the left, with a line of dark hills spanning the background. The camera then pans to the right, causing the initial red building to shift to the left side of the frame. This movement reveals a small, illuminated Christmas tree in the left middle ground and a second red building in the right middle ground, framing a wide, snowy area that fills the center. The camera maintains a consistent eye-level height throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
