  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a brightly lit digital display board showcasing various skewered food items, including vegetables and meats, arranged neatly on a tray. This board, featuring text in Japanese and decorative images of the food, occupies most of the frame and is positioned centrally in the foreground, with the camera slightly above it. The camera is at eye level, initially positioned at a high angle looking down. It then moves backward, smoothly pans 90 degrees to the left, tilts up to a level angle, and moves forward, transitioning to a wide shot of a modern indoor walkway. The menu board moves out of the frame, revealing more of the environment. The walkway stretches into the background, with metal railings on the left side and a wall on the right, illuminated by soft, ambient lighting. An escalator on the left is in operation, adding the only movement in the otherwise still scene. The camera continues to move down the corridor towards a distant area with visible signage and storefronts, maintaining a consistent camera height relative to the subjects and surroundings. In the distance, two people are seen standing near a brightly lit area with signage, emphasizing the spacious and contemporary setting. The corridor features contemporary architectural elements, including metal railings and wooden accents. The focus remains deep with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements are sharp. Overlay elements include a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" in the lower corners, which is not part of the scene itself. The transition from the initial full shot to the wide shot of the walkway is smooth, capturing the spaciousness and contemporary design of the corridor.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a menu board showcasing various skewered food items, including vegetables and meats, arranged neatly on a tray. The camera then starts to pan left, gradually revealing more of the walkway and the surrounding environment. As the camera continues to move, the focus shifts to the walkway, which is modern and well-lit, with metal railings on the left side and a clean, minimalist design.

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, transitions from an indoor setting featuring a brightly lit menu display to a modern, sleek corridor. Initially, the focus is on a menu board showcasing various dishes, likely in a restaurant or food establishment, with text and images prominently displayed. The scene then shifts to a spacious, well-lit hallway with contemporary architectural elements, including metal railings and wooden accents. The corridor features a wall on the right and an escalator on the left, illuminated by soft, ambient lighting. Overlay elements include a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" in the lower corners, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a brightly lit menu board, occupying most of the frame. This board is positioned centrally in the foreground, with its detailed text and images of skewered food items clearly visible. The camera is slightly above the menu board. As the video progresses, the camera pans to the left, transitioning to a wide shot of a modern indoor walkway. The menu board moves out of the frame, revealing more of the environment. The walkway stretches into the background, with metal railings on the left side and a wall on the right. Two people are seen in the distance, standing still near a brightly lit area with signage.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
