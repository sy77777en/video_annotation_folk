  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, a fair-skinned man with short, dark hair, wearing a distinctive yellow and brown V-neck cardigan with a chevron pattern over a collared shirt and a patterned tie, paired with dark trousers, initially emerges from behind a brick fireplace positioned in the right foreground. He moves quickly from the right side of the frame toward the center-left, occupying the middle ground, gesturing with his hands and with his mouth open as if shouting. As he moves, a woman with short blonde hair in a blue and white checkered dress and a slightly hunched posture, suggesting she is prepared to move quickly, appears behind him in the background on the right and remains in the frame, bending down to assist a child in moving towards the man. A wooden mantelpiece holding a green toy tractor and a dark-colored shotgun with a wooden stock is visible in the right foreground, above the fireplace. The background is composed of dark wood-paneled walls on the left and a doorway to the right, opening into another part of the house. The room is warmly lit by a lamp with a pleated orange shade, and a framed picture hangs on the paneled wall. Filmed from a smooth, eye-level perspective, this shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground. The camera steadily moves backward and pans slightly left, lead tracking the running man from the front. As the camera tracks him, the man grows larger in the frame, enhancing the sense of urgency and movement within the scene.",

    "Subject": "The main subject is a fair-skinned man with short, dark hair who appears agitated. He is wearing a distinctive yellow and brown V-neck cardigan with a chevron pattern over a collared shirt and a patterned tie, paired with dark trousers. He moves quickly into view from behind a brick fireplace, gesturing with his hands and with his mouth open as if shouting. As he moves, a woman with short blonde hair in a blue and white checkered dress and a slightly hunched posture, suggesting she is prepared to move quickly, re-enters the frame from the same location, along with a child. On the wooden mantelpiece above the brick fireplace, a dark-colored shotgun with a wooden stock and a green toy tractor are visible.",
    "Motion": "A man in a yellow cardigan quickly steps forward from behind a brick fireplace, gesturing with his hands as he moves into the center of the room. As he comes into view, a woman in a checkered dress bends down to assist a child in moving towards the man.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a room characterized by dark wood-paneled walls and a prominent red brick fireplace. A wooden mantelpiece sits atop the fireplace, holding a green toy tractor and a shotgun. The room is warmly lit by a lamp with a pleated orange shade, and a framed picture hangs on the paneled wall. In the background, a doorway opens into another part of the house. A man in a yellow and brown cardigan moves from behind the fireplace into the room, while a woman in a checkered dress is briefly seen moving near the brick wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
