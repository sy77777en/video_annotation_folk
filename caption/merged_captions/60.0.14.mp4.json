  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person with light skin, dark curly hair, dark eye makeup, and a nose ring is positioned in the center foreground, wearing a green short-sleeved shirt and holding a blue lollipop. The video is shot from an unsteady, eye-level camera with a level angle, employing a shallow focus that keeps this person sharp while the background remains blurred. The scene takes place outdoors during the day against a light-colored brick wall covered in black and red graffiti. In the middle ground, another person with darker skin and dark hair pulled back, wearing a dark jacket over a blue top, stands to the left, while a third individual with light skin and pink hair, wearing an orange tank top over a dark shirt, is partially visible on the right. The lighting is bright and even, illuminating the entire setting. The person in the foreground puts down the blue lollipop and sticks out their tongue to reveal it's stained blue, while the two people in the background move their hands. The camera's movement is erratic and lacks a clear pattern, capturing the dynamic interactions among the subjects.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion video is shot from an unsteady, eye-level camera with a level angle. It employs a shallow focus, keeping the person with curly hair in the foreground sharp while the background remains blurred. The camera's movement is erratic and lacks a clear pattern.",
    "Subject": "The video features three people. In the foreground and center, a person with light skin, dark curly hair, dark eye makeup, and a nose ring wears a green short-sleeved shirt while eating a blue lollipop, which has stained their tongue blue. In the left middle ground, a partially visible individual with darker skin and dark hair pulled back is wearing a dark jacket over a blue top. In the right middle ground, another partially visible person with light skin and pink hair is wearing an orange tank top over a dark shirt.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day, set against a light-colored brick wall covered in black and red graffiti. In the foreground, a person with dark, curly hair and a green shirt holds a blue lollipop. Other individuals are positioned in the middle ground, standing near the wall.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
