  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, capturing a man in black mid-flip in the middle-left ground center, positioned over a wooden cart on the left. A crouching figure is in the center of the middle ground, with traditional buildings lining the street on the left and right from the middle ground into the background. The street is set in a historical Japanese village under an overcast sky, with traditional two-story wooden buildings featuring dark tiled roofs, white plaster walls, and dark wood framing. Purple fabric banners, one marked with a white circular crest, hang over the entrances of the shops. As the man in black completes his flip, the camera smoothly tracks forward from a hip-level angle, maintaining deep focus on the entire street scene. The man performs a handspring, launching himself off the bundles of straw mats on a handcart that another man is bent over. After launching, he performs a somersault followed by a backflip in the middle of the street. Upon landing, he attempts to pass through the center of a palanquin, over the woman sitting inside, as it is carried by two men. The camera moves closer to him, tightening into a medium shot and keeping him in the center. He then approaches a palanquin, which enters from the right middle, and he attempts to jump through it as it passes. The people in historical attire, including those carrying the handcart and palanquin, move slowly through the street. Various onlookers in traditional robes and kimonos are present, wearing simple, loose-fitting garments and some with headbands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, following the man in black as he performs a series of acrobatic flips down the street.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level, level angle, the camera smoothly tracks forward, following a man in black from behind as he performs a series of acrobatic flips down a street. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a man in modern clothing who performs a series of acrobatic flips down a street that appears to be from historical Japan.

Subsequently, two other men are shown carrying a palanquin with a woman seated inside. Various onlookers in traditional robes and kimonos are present, wearing simple, loose-fitting garments and some with headbands.

The street is lined with traditional two-story wooden buildings featuring dark tiled roofs, white plaster walls, and dark wood framing. Purple fabric banners, one marked with a white circular crest, hang over the entrances of the shops. The road is a mix of worn pavement and dirt, with gravel along the edges. In the background, green trees are visible on a slight incline. Various props populate the scene, including a two-wheeled wooden cart carrying a large bundle wrapped in a grass mat, and a wooden palanquin being carried by two men. Other people in period-style clothing are positioned along the street, some standing and others walking.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
