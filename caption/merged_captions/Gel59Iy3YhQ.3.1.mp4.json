  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot of an empty office hallway, presented as a wide, first-person POV shot from eye level, looking straight down the long corridor, which establishes a strong one-point perspective. The video begins with a large window located in the middle ground on the left wall, and a door marked \"447\" can be seen on the left wall in the foreground. On the right wall, a white door marked \"448\" is positioned in the middle ground. Further down the hall in the background, another door marked \"449\" is visible, with several papers scattered on the floor near the end of the hallway. The camera moves smoothly forward down the center of the hallway, intermittently trucking slightly left and right, maintaining a level angle and a deep focus to keep the entire scene in sharp detail. As the camera advances, elements like the door and papers transition from the middle ground into the foreground before passing out of the frame, while the background elements, particularly door 449, move closer to become the central focus. The corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet, and a beige ceiling with recessed, rectangular fluorescent lights. A large, rectangular window on the left wall looks into an adjacent office where a clock is visible on the wall, and there is also another large, rectangular window on the right wall that looks into another office. The focus is on the sterile, liminal environment itself rather than centering on a specific character or object. The scene is still, with no movement from any objects or characters, emphasizing the emptiness and quiet of the office space.",

    "Subject": "This is a scenery shot of an empty office hallway. The focus is on the sterile, liminal environment itself rather than centering on a specific character or object. The long corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet littered with scattered papers, and a ceiling with recessed fluorescent lights. White doors are marked with numbers, such as '448' and '449', and large windows on both sides of the wall offer glimpses into adjacent, dimly lit office spaces.",
    "Motion": "This eye-level shot moves smoothly forward through an empty office hallway, intermittently trucking slightly left and right, providing a first-person perspective down the long corridor. The scene is still, with no movement from any objects or characters.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves down an empty office hallway. The corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet, and a beige ceiling with recessed, rectangular fluorescent lights. On the right, a white door is marked with the number \"448,\" while another door further down at the end of the hallway is labeled \"449.\" Additional doors are present on both sides of the hallway. A large, rectangular window on the left wall looks into an adjacent office where a clock is visible on the wall, and there is also another large, rectangular window on the right wall that looks into another office. Several white papers are scattered on the carpeted floor near the left wall towards the end of the hallway.",
    "Spatial": "This is a scenery shot of an empty office hallway. The video is presented as a wide, first-person POV shot from eye level, looking straight down the long corridor, which establishes a strong one-point perspective. Initially, a large window is located in the middle ground on the left wall. A door marked \"447\" can be seen on the left wall in the foreground. On the right wall, a white door marked \"448\" is positioned in the middle ground. Further down the hall in the background, another door marked \"449\" is visible, with several papers scattered on the floor near the end of the hallway.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
