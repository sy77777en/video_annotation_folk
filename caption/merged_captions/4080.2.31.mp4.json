  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man with medium skin tone is positioned in the center of the frame, shown in profile looking toward the top left. His hand, which has dark-painted fingernails, is located in the bottom left, touching his chin. He occupies the foreground, surrounded by bright, out-of-focus particles scattered throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera is stationary, positioned at the subject's level, and taken from an underwater perspective, though the video is too blurry to determine the camera's focus, and the lack of background cues makes any potential motion unclear. The man remains still throughout the video. The scene is immersed in a deep blue, fluid-like environment filled with countless bright, out-of-focus particles that create a sparkling, bokeh effect. The entire setting is bathed in monochromatic blue light, with brighter cyan highlights illuminating the profile of the person. He has dark, voluminous hair styled upwards and wears a beaded necklace, with his shoulders appearing bare. Bright highlights illuminate the side of his face and hair, and small, glowing particles are scattered throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "A man with medium skin tone is shown in profile, facing up and to the left of the frame with his eyes closed under intense blue lighting. He has dark, voluminous hair styled upwards. His left hand, which has dark-painted fingernails, is raised to his chin. He wears a beaded necklace, and his shoulders appear to be bare.

    "Scene": "The scene is immersed in a deep blue, fluid-like environment filled with countless bright, out-of-focus particles that create a sparkling, bokeh effect. The entire setting is bathed in monochromatic blue light, with brighter cyan highlights illuminating the profile of a person. The individual, who has dark, textured hair, is positioned facing upward with their eyes closed and their hand gently touching their chin.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
