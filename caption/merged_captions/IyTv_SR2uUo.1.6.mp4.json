  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with blond hair in the bottom center foreground, crouched on a paddleboard. He wears a short-sleeved black rash guard, purple and blue patterned board shorts, a black watch on his left wrist, and a black ankle leash on his right ankle. A massive wave dominates the scene, with its turquoise face occupying the right and center of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. The white, breaking crest of the wave is positioned in the top center and top right, while a clear blue sky is visible in the background in the top right corner. The camera, from an unsteady, above-water position, is set at a level angle with a deep focus. It continuously moves leftward to track the surfer from the side while also rolling back and forth with the motion of the waves, creating a varying Dutch angle. The man rides from right to left along the face of the large, curling ocean wave, maintaining a low crouch on the board and holding a black paddle with both hands for balance. As the wave breaks over him, he is enclosed within the tube of water, surfing forward. The camera remains fixed relative to him as he rides along the face of the wave, causing the background and the breaking part of the wave to move from left to right across the frame. The scene is set outdoors on a bright, sunny day under a clear, deep blue sky. A locked-on POV shot, mounted to a paddleboard, captures the man riding the massive, curling ocean wave, with the turquoise face and crest of white foam dominating the view, breaking to the right of the rider.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
