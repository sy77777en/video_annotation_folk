  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a black and white soccer ball, slightly towards the center-left of the frame, against a stark white background. The ball appears to be mid-air and rotating slowly. As the camera smoothly pans left and tilts downward, it zooms out, revealing a bright green, upward-sloping surface at the very bottom of the frame with a Dutch angle, giving it a tilted appearance. The green surface becomes more prominent, occupying the bottom third of the frame as it slopes from the bottom left towards the center-right. The camera movement is very smooth and comes to a complete stop, capturing the soccer ball flying toward an anime character. The character, a young male with spiky, light-colored hair, is depicted mid-air in a dynamic pose to the left of the ball, suggesting imminent interaction. He wears a dark long-sleeved undershirt beneath a white sleeveless jersey featuring the black number \"7,\" white shorts, dark socks, and a dark arm sleeve. Both of his arms are extended forward, while both legs are bent backward. The vibrant green, grass-like surface and the anime-style male character gradually come into view as the camera zooms out, while the background remains consistently white.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly pans left, tilts downward, and comes to a complete stop, capturing a soccer ball flying toward the anime character. There is a Dutch angle effect, with the grass field appearing tilted from the bottom left to the center right. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a black and white soccer ball with hexagonal and pentagonal panels, initially positioned against a white background. As the camera zooms out, it reveals a bright green surface resembling a grassy field, with the angle of the shot creating a Dutch angle effect. An anime character, a young male with spiky, light-colored hair, then appears to the left of the ball. He is depicted mid-air in a dynamic pose, as if about to intercept and control the ball. He wears a dark long-sleeved undershirt beneath a white sleeveless jersey featuring the black number \"7,\" white shorts, dark socks, and a dark arm sleeve. Both of his arms are extended forward, while both legs are bent backward.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a black and white soccer ball that appears to be mid-air and rotating slowly against a stark white background. As the soccer ball moves towards the left and backward, the camera zooms out to reveal a green grass surface. An anime character with spiky, light-colored hair then appears to the left of the ball, depicted mid-air in a dynamic pose, suggesting imminent interaction with the ball.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a soccer ball moving through the air against a bright white background, making the green grass below initially invisible. As the ball continues its motion, the vibrant green, grass-like surface and an anime-style male character with white hair and a dark athletic uniform, marked with the number \"7\", gradually come into view. The character is in a dynamic, mid-action pose near the soccer ball, while the background remains stark white.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot of a soccer ball, slightly towards the center-left of the frame, against a white background. As the camera zooms out, a bright green, upward-sloping surface appears at the very bottom of the frame with a Dutch angle, giving it a tilted appearance. It also becomes a wide shot capturing both an anime character and the soccer ball as the camera zooms out. The green surface becomes more prominent, occupying the bottom third of the frame as it slopes from the bottom left towards the center-right. The background remains consistently white."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
