  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a male blackbuck positioned in the right-center of the frame and in the middle ground. Vibrant green grass occupies the foreground, while a blurry line of trees under a pale blue sky constitutes the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the composition remains mostly unchanged throughout the video as the camera smoothly zooms in. The blackbuck, with a dark brown to black coat, distinct white fur circling its eyes and on its muzzle, and long, black horns spiraling upwards and outwards to form a prominent V-shape, stands motionless in the grassy field, looking directly at the camera. The video begins with an overlay element resembling a shutter effect, where a black block snaps into place, revealing the blackbuck standing in a vast, sunlit grassy field. The scene is captured from a distance, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the animal in sharp focus while the grassy foreground and distant background are heavily blurred.",

    "Camera": "Filmed at a level angle, the camera smoothly zooms in on a blackbuck. The shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the animal in the midground in sharp focus while the grassy foreground and distant background are heavily blurred.",
    "Subject": "A male blackbuck stands in a vibrant green, grassy field. The antelope has a dark brown to black coat, with distinct white fur circling its eyes and on its muzzle. Its long, black horns spiral upwards and outwards, forming a prominent V-shape. The animal is positioned in the right-center of the view, facing forward and looking directly ahead at the camera.",
    "Motion": "A male blackbuck stands motionless in a grassy field, looking directly at the camera.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with an overlay element resembling a shutter effect, where a black block snaps into place, revealing a blackbuck with a dark coat, white facial markings, and long, spiraling horns standing in a vast, sunlit grassy field. The foreground is composed of vibrant green grass, while the distant background features a soft, blurry line of trees under a pale blue, hazy sky. The scene is captured from a distance, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the animal in focus.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
