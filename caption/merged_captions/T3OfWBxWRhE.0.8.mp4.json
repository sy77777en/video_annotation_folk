  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a tropical landscape at either sunrise or sunset. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by the calm water of a lagoon, which extends from the foreground into the middle ground. A horizontal row of silhouetted overwater bungalows with thatched roofs stretches across the frame from the left side to the right side, standing on stilts above the reflective water. In the background, a large, jagged mountain range is positioned on the right, silhouetted against a dramatic sky where the sun glows brightly from behind a peak. The sky itself displays a gradient from deep teal to soft pink, with scattered clouds illuminated in vibrant shades of orange and rose. The camera remains still, capturing this serene scene with a deep focus that keeps the entire view, from the water's edge to the overwater bungalows in the middle ground and the distant mountains, sharp and clear. The surface of the water gently ripples, reflecting the colors of the sky. The composition is designed to capture the overall serene atmosphere and picturesque beauty of the environment, emphasizing the scale and color of the natural setting. The camera is positioned at a level angle, close to the surface of the water, and the shot is presented as a time-lapse, allowing the viewer to experience the subtle changes in light and color as the sun moves behind the mountain peak. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the tranquil landscape and the harmonious interplay of natural elements.",

A row of overwater bungalows, rendered as dark silhouettes, stands on stilts above the calm, reflective water. In the background, a large, jagged mountain range is also silhouetted against a dramatic sky, where the sun glows brightly from behind a peak. The sky itself is a blend of deep teal and soft pink, with scattered clouds illuminated in vibrant shades of orange and rose. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall serene atmosphere and picturesque beauty of the environment, emphasizing the scale and color of the natural setting.",

    "Scene": "A view of a tropical lagoon is shown at sunrise or sunset. A row of silhouetted overwater bungalows with thatched roofs stands on stilts above the calm water. In the background, a large mountain is also silhouetted against the sky. The sky displays a gradient from dark teal to soft pink, with clouds illuminated by the warm light of the sun, which is positioned behind the mountain.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
