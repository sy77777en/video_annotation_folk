  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot of an elderly woman wearing a patterned headscarf, a gray cardigan, and a dark dress with a dotted design, holding a decorative umbrella. The setting is a serene outdoor grassy area with scattered stones, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. The camera is at hip level, initially at a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. As the video progresses, the transition to a medium shot effectively broadens the view, highlighting more of her upper body and surroundings. The woman, holding a patterned umbrella, looks up and speaks to someone off-camera. The camera tilts down from the old woman's face to her wallet, then pans right and tilts up to follow the wallet, pausing briefly before tilting down again. She bends down, possibly interacting with a bag on the ground, while holding a small brown object. The woman extends the item towards the person off-camera and finally places it on the ground in front of them. The environment is natural, with a focus on the ground where the interaction occurs. The overall atmosphere is calm, with muted colors reflecting the overcast sky, and the setting is serene, with no visible urban elements, emphasizing the natural landscape. The camera maintains a consistent perspective at the subject's level, emphasizing the woman's actions and the peaceful environment. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, suggesting light rain or the potential for rain, as indicated by the umbrella. The setting appears to be outdoors, with grass visible around her, and the video captures an outdoor setting on a cloudy day, featuring a grassy area with scattered stones.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
