  "merged_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, showing a stylized male figure from the waist up, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the foreground. His head and upper torso are visible, with his face and upper body aligned with the vertical center of the image. The camera is at the same height as the subject’s head, providing a straight-on view. This static, eye-level shot is a stop-motion animation, with the camera maintaining a level angle and using an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the puppet man in the foreground. The stylized male figure slightly sways his head, speaks, and occasionally blinks throughout the video. In the background, a blurred wall and a dark blue vertical surface are visible. A simple chair with horizontal slats appears on the left side of the frame, also in the background. A brown desk is on the left side in the middle ground. The spatial arrangement remains static throughout the shot, with no notable movement or change in the positions of the subject or background elements. The video features a stylized male figure with a pale, elongated face and prominent ears, characterized by short, dark brown hair parted to the side, round eyeglasses, and faint stubble on his chin and upper lip. He has a slightly open mouth and visible blush on his cheeks, giving his face a flushed appearance. The man is dressed in a light gray collared shirt with a small pocket on his left chest, and his expression appears neutral. The figure’s features and attire are rendered in a sculpted, handcrafted style, suggesting he is a puppet or stop-motion character rather than a real person. The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue and gray tones. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the overall atmosphere is calm and quiet.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue and gray tones. The background features a blurred wall and a dark blue vertical surface, possibly a door or partition, along with a simple chair with horizontal slats. The environment is uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and minimal decoration. A stylized figure with a pale, matte-textured face, round glasses, and short brown hair stands centrally, facing forward. The figure’s shirt is light-colored with a small pocket and subtle button details. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the overall atmosphere is calm and quiet. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
