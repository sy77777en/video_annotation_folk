In the foreground, a clear drinking glass filled with water, decorated with a decal of a football player in a red uniform posed against a large blue number \"14,\" rests. The camera, in an unsteady, high-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focuses on the glass in the foreground and moves slightly from left to right, capturing three noticeable vibrations affecting the scene. In the middle ground, a brown, spiral-bound notebook with a red pen featuring a white polka-dot pattern and a silver tip is positioned. A small pink, pig-like figurine is located in the center middle ground, directly behind the glass. In the top right middle ground, several out-of-focus trophies are visible, including two golden-colored trophies with black bases and a separate, entirely golden-colored trophy. A textured, off-white wall occupies the top left background.",

    "Scene": "An indoor scene features several items arranged on a wooden surface against a textured, off-white wall. A clear glass of water, decorated with a sticker of a person in a red uniform, has the number '14' in blue on the glass itself. The glass rests on a brown, spiral-bound notebook. Beside the notebook lies a red pen with a white polka-dot pattern and a silver tip. Positioned behind the glass is a small, pink, creature-like figurine. In the background, two gold-colored trophies with black bases and a fully gold-colored trophy are visible but out of focus.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, displays several items on a wooden surface.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
