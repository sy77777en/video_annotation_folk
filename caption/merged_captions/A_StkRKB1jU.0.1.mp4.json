  "merged_caption": "The video starts as a medium full shot from a high angle, showing a silhouetted person in the left middle ground standing by a large, partially shattered window in a high-rise office during daylight. The window offers a view of adjacent flat-roofed, light-colored stone buildings. In the bottom-right foreground, the back of a second person's head is visible at a desk, wearing a clown mask with some visible hair at the back of it, before it moves out of the frame. The first person, wearing dark clothing and a red head covering, remains in the left middle ground, holding and aiming a dark, metallic, grappling hook-like device with a black cord. The camera, from an eye-level, high-angle perspective, trucks left while moderately panning right to follow the person launching the grappling hook. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The silhouetted figure stands by the broken window and prepares the grappling hook device, while the second person observes them, shifting nervously in their position. The first individual then raises the device and aims it out of the window toward the buildings across the way. As they aim it out the broken window, which occupies the center and right of the frame, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more on the upper body of the standing individual. The cityscape is visible in the background through the window throughout the scene. The camera then becomes static, exhibiting subtle shaking. Inside, a desk is visible near the window, with a dark green bag and a coiled black cable resting on it. The silhouetted figure manipulates the dark, elongated object attached to the cable, while the second individual watches him impatiently before exiting the frame.",

    "Subject": "A person in silhouette, wearing dark clothing and a red head covering, stands facing a broken window. Their facial features are mostly obscured, but a prominent nose is visible in profile. This individual holds and aims a dark, metallic, grappling hook-like device with a black cord out of the window.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
