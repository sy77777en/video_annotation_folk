  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with two women centrally positioned in the middle ground against a dark background. A light-colored floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. One woman, in a white judo gi with a black belt and her hair tied in a ponytail, lifts the woman in a blue judo gi, also with a black belt and a ponytail, sideways right from the start, initiating a throw. The woman in blue, identified by a patch on her back that reads \"J. TUTASS\" and \"USA,\" rotates horizontally in the air, her legs extending towards the frame's left and her upper body towards the frame's right, while her overall position remains central. The woman in white acts as a stable pivot in the center middle ground throughout this dynamic movement. The scene takes place indoors in a dimly lit gym or dojo, characterized by a spacious, open area with a smooth, light-colored mat covering the floor. The lighting is focused, casting shadows and highlighting the movement of the participants. The action involves dynamic grappling, with the woman in white executing a throw, capturing the fluid motion and physicality of the match. This slow-motion video is captured from a static, ground-level, low-angle perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both judo practitioners in focus as the woman in white uses her body to push the woman in blue down, guiding her through the air in an arc. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, emphasizing the figures and their movements against the subdued setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
