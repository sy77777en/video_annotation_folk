  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot. A smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges is positioned in the foreground, vertically oriented in the bottom center of the frame and extending towards the center. Behind this rod, in the middle ground, a large, curved, silvery metallic structure occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom towards the top. The background consists of a textured, light blue-grey surface visible at the top of the frame. The camera uses a shallow focus, concentrating on the foreground. Fixed to a pointer, the camera arcs smoothly clockwise around the edge of a metallic object. As the camera moves, it remains fixed on the clock's hand, which rotates in a clockwise direction. This motion reveals more of the large, metallic structure, whose surface is adorned with numerous small, raised elements that resemble letters, arranged in intricate rows and patterns, alongside horizontal bands featuring repeating square indentations. The metal exhibits a reflective quality with some areas showing a weathered or slightly corroded texture. The details of the structure's surface, including the weathered texture and reflective quality, become more apparent as the hand continues its rotation. The smaller, rectangular rod in the foreground remains in view, maintaining its position relative to the larger structure. The camera's focus ensures that the intricate details of the structure are captured clearly. A textured, light blue-grey surface forms the background, and the scene is dimly illuminated by a cool light. The camera height and angle are difficult to determine due to a lack of background information.",

    "Camera": "The camera uses a shallow focus, concentrating on the foreground. Fixed to a pointer, the camera arcs smoothly clockwise around the edge of a metallic object. The camera height and angle are difficult to determine due to a lack of background information.",
    "Subject": "A detailed view reveals a large, metallic structure with a silvery-white surface. Its surface is adorned with numerous small, raised elements that resemble letters, arranged in intricate rows and patterns, alongside horizontal bands featuring repeating square indentations. The metal exhibits a reflective quality with some areas showing a weathered or slightly corroded texture. In the foreground, a smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges and a rough, somewhat corroded metallic surface partially obscures the larger structure. This object resembles a very old and special clock.",
    "Motion": "The camera remains fixed on the clock's hand, which rotates in a clockwise direction. As the hand moves, it reveals more of the large, metallic structure. The structure's surface is consistent, with intricate rows of raised letters and horizontal bands of square indentations becoming more visible. The background is a textured, blue-gray surface, possibly a wall or another large object, providing a contrasting backdrop to the metallic structure. The details of the structure's surface, including the weathered texture and reflective quality, become more apparent as the hand continues its rotation. The smaller, rectangular rod in the foreground remains in view, maintaining its position relative to the larger structure. The camera's focus ensures that the intricate details of the structure are captured clearly.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, with the camera fixed to a silvery, rectangular foreground object with rounded edges, offers a close perspective of a large, curved, silvery metallic structure. This reflective structure is detailed with horizontal bands; the uppermost band features numerous small, raised rectangular elements in rows, while lower bands have repeating rectangular indentations. A textured, light blue-grey surface forms the background, and the scene is dimly illuminated by a cool light.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot. A smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges is positioned in the foreground, vertically oriented in the bottom center of the frame and extending towards the center. Behind this rod, in the middle ground, a large, curved, silvery metallic structure occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom towards the top. The background consists of a textured, light blue-grey surface visible at the top of the frame. The camera moves along with the rod throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
