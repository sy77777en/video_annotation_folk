  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene is viewed through a frame composed of a dark window frame and windowsill in the middle ground, which segments the view. In the middle ground, an animated brown mouse with large pink ears and a long tail stands on its hind legs in the center of the frame on a windowsill, holding a thin, pointed wooden stick resembling a toothpick. The mouse pulls the edge of the toothpick from its mouth and makes a chewing motion before returning it, holding the toothpick with its right hand while its feet remain stationary. A bowl of green olives is positioned to the left of the mouse, and a coupe glass containing a transparent liquid is to the right, both also in the middle ground on the sill. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the animated mouse in the midground in focus while the background is blurred. In the out-of-focus background, a bed with white linens and a green blanket occupies the central and center-right portions of the inner frame, while a green vase with white flowers is partially visible in the left portions of the inner frame. The scene is set in a softly lit room, viewed through a dark, rectangular frame composed of a windowsill and window frames that segment the space.",

    "Subject": "An animated brown mouse with large pink ears and a long tail stands on its hind legs. The anthropomorphic mouse holds a thin, pointed wooden stick, resembling a toothpick, in its paws. To the left of the mouse is a small bowl containing green olives, and to the right of it is a glass coupe containing a transparent liquid.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a softly lit room, viewed through a dark, rectangular frame composed of a windowsill and window frames that segment the space. In the out-of-focus background, a bed with white linens and a green blanket is visible. On a light-colored countertop in the background, between the bed and the windowsill, a green vase with white flowers is partially visible. A small bowl of green olives and a coupe-style cocktail glass with liquid are on the windowsill. An animated brown mouse, holding a toothpick, is composited into the live-action scene, standing on the windowsill between the olives and the glass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
