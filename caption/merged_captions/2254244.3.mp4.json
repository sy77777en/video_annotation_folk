  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot capturing a cityscape from a high aerial perspective. Initially, a prominent brick building with a dome is positioned in the center-right middle ground, with a tall church spire located in the left middle ground. Other buildings populate the foreground, middle ground, and background, with streets visible below. Hills and a body of water are visible in the distant background. The video begins with an aerial view of a cityscape, featuring a prominent building with a dome and a flag on top, surrounded by other buildings and streets. The camera features an aerial-level drone that starts at a level angle and transitions to a high angle, looking down. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly forward throughout, tilts down, and pans left midway to adjust its orientation, capturing a city scene. Consequently, the domed building shifts towards the right side of the frame and moves into the foreground. As the camera moves forward, the building with the dome becomes more central in the frame, and the surrounding buildings and streets become more visible. The camera continues to move forward and gradually pans left, adjusting its orientation and transitioning the focus to other scenes. This reveals more details of the adjacent buildings, including a tall spire on the left side of the frame. As the camera further advances, it shows a parking lot with stationary vehicles and more buildings in the background. The video concludes with a closer view of the building with the dome and the tall spire, with the surrounding cityscape becoming more detailed. The overall view expands slightly, revealing more of the city to the left and in the background. The lighting is bright, with the sun casting long shadows, indicating a clear day.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with a focus on the architectural elements and the overall atmosphere of the city. The camera work highlights the scale and layout of the city, showcasing a prominent building with a dome and a tall spire, as well as surrounding structures. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings, with the distant hills and a body of water adding depth to the scene. The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a small urban area during the day. The setting features a mix of historic and modern architecture, with prominent buildings including a multi-story structure with arched windows and a dome, and a tall, pointed church steeple. The streets below are lined with trees, and a few vehicles are visible, with light traffic flowing smoothly along the roads, indicating a calm urban activity. In the background, rolling hills and a body of water can be seen, suggesting a scenic landscape surrounding the town. The lighting is bright, with the sun casting long shadows, indicating a clear day. The overall scene combines urban and natural elements, providing a comprehensive view of the town's layout and its surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
