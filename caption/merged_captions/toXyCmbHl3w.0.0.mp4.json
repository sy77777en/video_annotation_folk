  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a man seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car, positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame, appearing in the middle ground. His upper body and face are clearly visible, with a light skin tone, short dark hair, and a beard. He is wearing a red jacket over a dark shirt and maintains a serious expression as he focuses on the road ahead. The car's interior, including the steering wheel and dashboard, is in the foreground. The background consists of an urban street at night, with modern buildings and streetlights visible. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field, and is locked on the front of the car, creating a smooth lead-tracking shot. The man is already driving at the start of the video, turning the steering wheel as the car first turns right and then moves forward. Initially, the windshield is clear, providing a direct view of the man and the street behind him. As the video progresses, raindrops begin to appear on the windshield, gradually becoming more prominent and occasionally reflecting the streetlights, slightly obscuring the view of the man but not altering his position or the camera angle. The spatial framing remains consistent, with the man slightly off-center and the urban environment consistently in the background. The street is relatively empty, suggesting a quiet night, with the car moving smoothly along the road. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the car's journey through the cityscape.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car. He has a light skin tone, short dark hair, and a beard. He is wearing a red jacket over a dark shirt and is focused on the road ahead, with a serious expression. The car's interior is visible, showing the steering wheel and part of the dashboard. In the latter half of the video, raindrops on the windshield occasionally reflect the streetlights, slightly obscuring the view of the man, but his features and attire remain discernible. The setting appears to be an urban environment at night.",
    "Motion": "A man is seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car, with the car door closed. The background shows a street with buildings and streetlights. The man is already driving at the start of the video, turning the steering wheel as raindrops begin to appear on the windshield. The raindrops gradually become more prominent, and the man maintains his focus on the road ahead, with the raindrops partially obscuring his face.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a nighttime urban setting viewed from a locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to a car, maintaining a fixed perspective. The scene unfolds on a city street, characterized by modern buildings with large glass windows. The environment is dimly lit, with streetlights casting a soft glow on the pavement. The car, a sleek red vehicle, is central to the scene, with its glossy surface reflecting the ambient light. Raindrops are visible on the windshield, indicating recent or ongoing rain, adding texture to the glass. The street is relatively empty, suggesting a quiet night, with the car moving smoothly along the road. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the car's journey through the cityscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium shot of a man seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car. The man is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame, appearing in the middle ground. His upper body and face are clearly visible, while the car's interior, including the steering wheel and dashboard, is also in the foreground. The background consists of an urban street at night, with buildings and streetlights visible. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the sequence. Initially, the windshield is clear, providing a direct view of the man and the street behind him. As the video progresses, raindrops appear on the windshield, slightly obscuring the view but not altering the man's position or the camera angle. The spatial framing remains consistent, with the man slightly off-center and the urban environment consistently in the background. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position during the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
