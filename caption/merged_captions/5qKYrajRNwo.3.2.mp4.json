  "merged_caption": "This full shot features a stop-motion puppet of a young girl with brown hair styled in two braids, kneeling slightly to the center-right in the middle ground. She wears a dark blue pinafore dress over a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. Her large, pinkish, oval-shaped eyes with heavily drooping upper eyelids, lacking visible pupils or irises, give her an unusual, doll-like appearance. She has a somewhat wide nose and a larger, downturned mouth. The scene is set indoors, in a moderately lit, cluttered space with a rough, possibly wooden or stone, floor. In the background, various indistinct items are piled up, including what appear to be various colored cloths and a dark green, rectangular box visible to the left of the center. The lighting creates a soft bokeh effect in the background. A small, golden pocket watch with a chain lies in the middle ground in front of her. Initially standing, the girl kneels down and reaches for the broken pocket watch on the ground. She carefully picks up the watch, which has a gold chain attached to it, and holds it in her hands. The camera is static, positioned at ground level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the midground, capturing the girl as she maintains her position while holding the pocket watch.",

    "Subject": "A stop-motion puppet of a young girl with brown hair styled in two braids is depicted kneeling. She wears a dark blue pinafore dress over a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. Her most striking features are her large, pinkish, oval-shaped eyes with heavily drooping upper eyelids, which lack visible pupils or irises, giving her an unusual, doll-like appearance. She has a somewhat wide nose and a larger, downturned mouth. She picks up a gold-colored pocket watch from the ground in front of her.",
    "Motion": "The background is a cluttered room with various objects, including a green cabinet and some indistinct items. The girl, initially standing, kneels down and reaches for the broken pocket watch on the ground. She carefully picks up the watch, which has a gold chain attached to it, and holds it in her hands.",

    "Spatial": "This full shot features a girl puppet kneeling slightly to the center-right in the middle ground. A gold-colored pocket watch is initially on the ground in front of her, also in the middle ground. The background contains various cluttered items, with a dark green rectangular box visible to the left of the center in the background. The girl, maintaining her position, picks up the pocket watch from the ground, holding it in her hands. The camera is positioned at the same height as the girl."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
