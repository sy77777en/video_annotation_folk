  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot centers on a man with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a backward dark cap and a dark blue T-shirt with visible wet stains reflecting sunlight. Positioned in the foreground, he stands in front of a green, leafy background that is out of focus. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field, and remains completely static throughout the shot. The video showcases a dynamic speed ramp effect, starting at a slow speed, further decelerating, and then returning to the initial slow speed. The man maintains the same position with his head slightly tilted back, eyes closed tightly, and a broad grin on his face, suggesting he is bracing for impact or reacting to something. A pink substance is thrown by a person's hand from the right side of the frame, flying towards him. As the video decelerates, the pink substance enters the frame and travels horizontally toward the center, splattering on the man's left face and adding to the stains on his shirt. The majority of the pink material continues moving to the left and exits the frame, while some settles on his face and shirt. The man's dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant colors of the pink material and the greenery, adding visual interest. The overall atmosphere is bright and energetic, with the natural elements and the colorful burst creating a vivid and engaging scene. The man remains in the same position throughout, with the camera capturing this dynamic and lively moment in an outdoor setting with a few leafy trees during the daytime.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a dynamic speed ramp effect, starting at a slow speed, further decelerating, and then returning to the initial slow speed. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field, and remains completely static without any movement or shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a backward dark cap. He is dressed in a dark blue T-shirt with visible wet stains on the front that reflect sunlight. The man has his eyes closed tightly and is broadly grinning, showing his teeth. His facial expression suggests he is bracing for impact or reacting to something. In the second part of the video, a pink substance is seen splattering on his left face, adding to the stains on his shirt. The man remains in the same position throughout, with his head slightly tilted back.",
    "Motion": "A man wearing a dark blue T-shirt with visible wet and reflective stains stands in front of a green, leafy background. A pink substance is thrown by a person's hand from the right side of the frame, flying towards him. The pink substance hits the man's face, causing it to spread and splatter, while the majority continues moving to the left and exits the frame. The man maintains the same position throughout the video, with his head slightly tilted back, eyes closed, and a broad grin on his face, as some of the pink substance settles on his face and shirt.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting with a few leafy trees during the daytime. The environment features a person standing centrally, with a playful expression, as a burst of pink material, appearing wetter and somewhat solid, surrounds them, suggesting a dynamic and lively moment. The person's dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant colors of the pink material and the greenery, adding visual interest. The overall atmosphere is bright and energetic, with the natural elements and the colorful burst creating a vivid and engaging scene, despite the background being out of focus.",
    "Spatial": "This medium close-up shot centers on a man positioned in the foreground of the frame. Behind him, a background of green trees is out of focus. A pink substance enters the frame from the right and travels horizontally toward the center, splattering on the man's face. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
