  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person dressed in a light-colored winter jacket, dark pants, and dark-colored gloves, walking through a snowy landscape. The camera captures the person's lower body up to the arms before tilting up to focus on the person's upper body and head. The person is positioned in the center of the frame throughout the video, moving forward and towards the right. The subject remains in the foreground throughout the sequence, while the expansive snowy terrain forms the middle ground and background. The sun, low on the horizon, is situated in the background, casting a warm, orange glow over the scene, suggesting a sunrise or sunset. The snow appears soft and slightly windswept, indicating a cold, breezy atmosphere. The camera, initially at a high angle, transitions to a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the person in the foreground. It smoothly tracks the person from behind and slightly to the side, moving towards the right front as they walk. The person is holding a camera in one hand and is facing away from the viewer, suggesting they are observing the scenery. The individual is wearing a hood, indicating cold weather conditions. The person appears to be alone, with no other human subjects visible. The camera tilts up to shift focus from their lower to upper body, maintaining minimal shaking throughout. In the distance, there are indistinct shapes, possibly rocks or structures, partially obscured by the snow and light. The overall setting conveys a sense of vastness and isolation, with the person standing amidst the natural beauty of the snowy expanse. The subject's consistent pace and direction are clearly depicted within the stable framing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
