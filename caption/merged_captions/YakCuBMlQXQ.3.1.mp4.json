  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, the lower legs and feet of two individuals, both clad in dark, loose-fitting trousers and sturdy boots, are framed from a level angle at ground level, aligned with the subjects. The individuals start in the center middle ground and walk steadily towards the camera across the uneven, leaf-littered ground of a dim forest, moving into the nearer middle ground. The forest floor, covered with dark soil, pine needles, sparse green vegetation, and tree twigs, occupies the foreground and middle ground. A tree stump is prominently visible in the right middle ground, with several tree trunks positioned in the out-of-focus background. As the subjects walk towards the camera, they increase in size within the frame. The unsteady camera initially focuses on the individuals' legs and boots walking forward in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The focus then racks to the forest floor in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "From a level, ground-level angle, the unsteady camera initially focuses on a person's legs and boots walking forward in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The focus then racks to the forest floor in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The lower halves of two individuals are visible, walking towards the camera. They are wearing dark, loose-fitting trousers and dark, sturdy boots. Their upper bodies and faces are not shown.",
    "Motion": "At a level angle, the lower legs and feet of two individuals, both clad in dark trousers and boots, walk steadily towards the camera across the uneven, leaf-littered ground of a forest.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle shot captures the legs and feet of two individuals walking through a dim forest. Both are wearing dark pants and boots as they move towards the camera across the uneven terrain. The ground is covered with dark soil, pine needles, sparse green vegetation, and tree twigs. A tree stump is prominently visible in the middle ground, with the trunks of larger trees in the soft-focus background.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, the lower legs and feet of a person are framed from a level angle at ground level, aligned with the subject. The person starts in the center middle ground and walks directly towards the camera, moving into the nearer middle ground. The forest floor occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a tree stump visible in the right middle ground and several tree trunks positioned in the out-of-focus background. As the subject walks towards the camera, they increase in size within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
