  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an underwater scene, set deep underwater with a dark blue background. A large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull, is positioned in the middle ground, stretching diagonally from the center-left towards the center-right of the frame. The sandy seabed occupies the foreground and the bottom portion of the frame, extending into the middle ground where the object rests. The visible portion of the hull has a dark, cracked texture on its sides, while its upper surface appears reddish and mottled. Deep blue water fills the background, middle ground, and foreground, with small, white, speck-like particles resembling marine snow drifting slowly throughout. The camera maintains a slightly elevated position relative to the seabed, with movements capturing the scene. It is at a level angle, maintaining a shallow focus with the middle ground in focus. The camera moves smoothly backward while slightly panning to the right, emphasizing the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world. The dim, atmospheric lighting and the partial obscurity of the object highlight the mysterious deep-sea environment rather than a specific, fully detailed subject. An overlay in the lower-left corner reads \"[2]\".",

    "Subject": "This is an underwater scenery shot. The focus is on the dark, mysterious deep-sea environment, characterized by deep blue water and floating white particles resembling marine snow. A large, elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides lies partially buried in the sandy seabed. The dim, atmospheric lighting and the partial obscurity of the object emphasize the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world rather than highlighting a specific, fully detailed subject.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a sunken ship's hull resting on the seabed. The scene is dark, with a deep blue hue to the water and some small white particles floating around. ",
    "Scene": "The scene is set deep underwater, with a dark blue background. A large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull, rests partially buried in the lighter-colored, sandy seabed. The visible portion of the hull has a dark, cracked texture on its sides, while its upper surface appears reddish and mottled. Small, white, speck-like particles drift slowly through the water. An overlay in the lower-left corner reads \"[2]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
