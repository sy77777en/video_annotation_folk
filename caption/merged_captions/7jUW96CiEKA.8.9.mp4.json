  "merged_caption": "The video captures a scene where a crocodile is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, facing right. It floats in calm, murky, brownish-green water with minor ripples, which occupies the middle ground and background of the scene. The crocodile remains completely stationary throughout the video, with its head, including its eyes and mouth, and part of its scaly, greenish-brown back visible above the surface. A faint reflection of the crocodile is visible beneath it. The camera is static, positioned above the water at a high angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the crocodile in the midground in focus. On the left side of the frame, out-of-focus green plant stems, possibly reeds, appear in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The water is relatively calm, and the scene appears to be set during the daytime under subdued lighting. The crocodile is mostly submerged, facing towards the right side of the scene, and its reflection is faintly visible on the water. In the out-of-focus foreground to the left, several thin, green plant stems are present. The background is a calm, murky water body with two out-of-focus water plants near the camera.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a crocodile floating in murky, brownish-green water. The crocodile is mostly submerged, with the top of its head, including its eyes and mouth, and the upper ridge of its scaly, greenish-brown back visible above the surface. It appears relatively still, facing towards the right side of the scene, and its reflection is faintly visible on the water. In the out-of-focus foreground to the left, several thin, green plant stems are present.",
    "Motion": "A crocodile is seen floating in the water, with its head, including its mouth, and part of its back visible above the surface. The crocodile remains completely stationary throughout the video. The background is a calm, murky water body with two out-of-focus water plants near the camera.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene centered on a body of murky, brownish water, likely a river. In the foreground, blurred green vegetation, possibly reeds, partially obscures the view. A crocodile is partially submerged in the water, positioned towards the bottom center of the frame and facing away from the camera. Its textured, greenish-brown head and upper back are visible above the water's surface, reflecting slightly. The water is relatively calm with minor ripples. The scene appears to be set during the daytime under subdued lighting.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a scene where a crocodile is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, facing right. It floats in calm, murky water with minor ripples, which occupies the middle ground and background of the scene. A faint reflection of the crocodile is visible beneath it. On the left side of the frame, out-of-focus green plant stems appear in the foreground. The crocodile remains relatively still throughout the shot, with the camera positioned above the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
