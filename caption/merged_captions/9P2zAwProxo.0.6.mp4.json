  "merged_caption": "This shot combines a close-up of a snowboard with a wide view of the scenery. The rounded tip of the snowboard, which is white or a very light cream color with a slightly mottled or textured appearance from clinging snow, is fixed in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame from the center. The snow-covered ground extends from the foreground to the background, effectively creating a dynamic sense of forward motion as it appears to rush toward the camera. The camera, mounted on the snowboard, captures a locked-on point of view as the tip of the snowboard glides forward through deep snow. The snowboard progresses down a slope, pushing the snow aside, and experiences a significant jolt that causes it to shift slightly to the right while navigating through a wooded area. The trees stretch from the middle ground to the background, positioned on both sides of the frame as the snowboard glides past them. The camera is fixed on the snowboard from a high, ground-level angle, capturing its quick descent. The shot is unsteady, with intense, irregular shakes and a varying Dutch angle as the camera rolls. During the rapid forward and downward movement, there is a brief, strong tilt down. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The ground is completely blanketed in white snow, with the rounded, off-white tip of the snowboard visible in the foreground. In the background and to the left, a dense collection of bare, dark tree trunks and thin branches stands against the white landscape, passing by as the camera moves forward.",

    "Subject": "This locked-on POV view video features a close-up of the front tip of a snowboard. The snowboard, which occupies the lower half of the perspective, is white or a very light cream color with a rounded nose. Its surface has a slightly mottled or textured appearance from clinging snow.",
    "Motion": "The camera, mounted on the snowboard, captures a locked-on point of view as the tip of the snowboard glides forward through deep snow. The snowboard progresses down a slope, pushing the snow aside, and experiences a significant jolt that causes it to shift slightly to the right while navigating through a wooded area.",
    "Scene": "The camera, mounted on a snowboard, glides swiftly down a snow-covered hillside during the day. The ground is completely blanketed in white snow, with the rounded, off-white tip of the snowboard visible in the foreground. In the background and to the left, a dense collection of bare, dark tree trunks and thin branches stands against the white landscape, passing by as the camera moves forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
