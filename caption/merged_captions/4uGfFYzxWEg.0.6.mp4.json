  "merged_caption": "The video begins from an audience perspective, initially showing only the lower body of a central humanoid figure in the upper frame and middle ground. The camera then moves upward, smoothly transitioning to a wide shot that reveals two stylized, low-polygon humanoid figures seated on high, modern chairs in the middle ground: one center-left, wearing a red and dark-colored top with light-colored pants, and the other center-right, clad in a light-colored, possibly grey or silver, outfit. Both figures exhibit a somewhat reflective sheen and have featureless heads, with their hands resting on their laps, facing each other across a sleek, metallic central console also in the middle ground and center frame. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the two figures seated at the table, ensuring they remain clear throughout. In the background, additional audience silhouettes are on tiered bleachers to the left and right, with two large, orange-illuminated staircases flanking the central scene, one on each side. Glowing orange lines radiate from the center of the stage floor in the middle ground. The scene is set indoors, on a dimly lit stage with a dark floor, highlighted by spotlights. In the foreground, silhouettes of several audience members are visible from the shoulders up, observing the stage. The overall aesthetic is futuristic and minimalist, dominated by dark tones contrasted with the bright orange lighting and metallic sheens. The two stylized figures on stage remain seated and still, facing each other with their hands on their laps. The audience members in the foreground and background also remain stationary. The camera is positioned at the level of the two central subjects on stage.",

    "Camera": "The camera begins at ground level and smoothly moves upward to eye level. It then transitions to zooming in. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the two figures seated at the table in the midground, ensuring they remain clear throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features two stylized, low-polygon humanoid figures seated on high chairs on a central, illuminated stage, facing each other across a stand that supports two small screens. The figure on the left wears a red and dark-colored top with light-colored pants, while the figure on the right is clad in a light-colored, possibly grey or silver, outfit; both exhibit a somewhat reflective sheen and have featureless heads, with their hands resting on their laps. In the foreground, silhouettes of several audience members are visible from the shoulders up, observing the stage. Further back, more stylized, dark, low-polygon humanoid figures are seated on tiered bleachers, also facing the stage.",
    "Motion": "The two stylized figures on stage remain seated and still, facing each other with their hands on their laps. The audience members in the foreground and background also remain stationary.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, on a dimly lit stage with a dark floor marked by glowing orange lines radiating from the center. Two low-poly, metallic-looking figures are seated on high, modern chairs, facing each other across a sleek, metallic central console. Behind them, two large staircases are illuminated with a warm orange glow. Silhouetted figures, representing an audience, are visible in the foreground and in the background on either side of the stage, observing the central scene which is highlighted by spotlights. The overall aesthetic is futuristic and minimalist, dominated by dark tones contrasted with the bright orange lighting and metallic sheens.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
