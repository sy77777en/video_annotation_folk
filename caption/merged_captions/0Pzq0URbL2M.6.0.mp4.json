  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind. Initially, the person occupies approximately 30% of the frame's height, positioned centrally in the middle ground. The subject is located in the center of the frame horizontally but in the lower half vertically. A significant portion of the frame, around 60% of the width, is initially obscured by a black wall on the left and right sides, leaving only the center part visible. The video begins with a distant view of a shirtless person standing with their back to the camera and head slightly downward, set against a dark, indistinct background. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera gradually moves forward smoothly, reducing the black obstruction and gradually revealing more of the indoor setting. This transition shifts the black wall from occupying most of the frame to being pushed towards the edges, allowing a clearer view of the textured, dark walls in the background. The person remains stationary throughout the video, and the background remains consistently dark and unclear. The person remains centered horizontally throughout, with their upper body consistently in focus. The camera maintains a position at the subject's height, ensuring the upper body and back remain the focal point. The final state of the video settles on a medium shot, with the subject still centrally positioned horizontally and the indoor environment more fully revealed in the background. The lighting remains subdued, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the contours of the figure's back. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the gradual unveiling of the setting while keeping the subject as the primary focus.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly, focusing on the person in the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind, slightly tilting their head downward. The individual has short, thinning dark hair, a light skin tone, and a slender physique. Initially, the person occupies a smaller portion of the frame, with a significant part obscured by a black wall. As the video progresses, the obstruction diminishes, revealing more of the indoor setting and settling on a medium shot of the person. The focus remains on the upper body, highlighting the person's back and shoulders.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a distant view of a shirtless person standing with their back to the camera and head slightly downward, set against a dark, indistinct background. The camera gradually moves closer, revealing more details of the person's back and shoulders. The person remains stationary throughout the video, and the background remains consistently dark and unclear.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with a dimly lit, narrow room featuring textured, dark walls. The environment is stark and minimalistic, with a focus on the central figure positioned in the middle of the scene. The walls have a rough, uneven surface, adding to the austere atmosphere. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and highlighting the contours of the figure's back. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by earthy tones. Overlay elements include a small icon in the bottom left corner, which reads \"[8]\" and is not part of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
