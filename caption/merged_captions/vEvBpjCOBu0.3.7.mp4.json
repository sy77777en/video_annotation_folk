  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the middle ground against a dark, textured background. The emblem, featuring a hammer and a compass surrounded by a wreath of rye and a tricolor ribbon, is illuminated by a spotlight, creating a clear focus. From a level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals down, causing the emblem to recede and blur into the background. As the camera moves, an empty, clear pint-style drinking glass appears to rise into the foreground, though the glass itself remains stationary on a flat, black, three-dimensional surface. The focus racks to the glass, which is centrally positioned on the black rectangular surface in the foreground, coming into sharp focus. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the transitions, maintaining a consistent perspective as the focus shifts from the emblem to the glass. The monochromatic setting is illuminated by a single overhead spotlight, enhancing the metallic texture of the emblem and the transparency of the glass.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals down. The shot begins with the East German emblem on the wall in focus. As the camera moves, a glass appears in the foreground, and the focus racks to the glass, leaving the emblem blurred in the background.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, rendered in grayscale with a metallic texture. The emblem, featuring a hammer and a compass surrounded by a wreath of rye and a tricolor ribbon, is centrally located and illuminated by a spotlight against a dark, textured background. The view then pulls back and moves downward vertically, causing the emblem to recede and blur into the background as a clear, empty pint-style drinking glass rises into the foreground, coming into sharp focus. The transparent glass sits on a flat, black, three-dimensional surface.",
    "Motion": "The view retracts and moves downward vertically from a static, close-up of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, causing the emblem to recede and blur into the background. As this occurs, the camera movement creates the effect of a clear, empty drinking glass rising into the foreground, though the glass itself remains stationary on the black surface, coming to a stop and settling into sharp focus.",
    "Scene": "In a monochromatic setting illuminated by a single overhead spotlight, a three-dimensional rendering of the East German national emblem is mounted on a textured wall. The emblem, featuring a hammer and compass encircled by a wreath of rye, is initially in sharp focus. The perspective then shifts, moving backwards and pedestaling down, causing the emblem to blur into the background as an empty, clear drinking glass on a black pedestal becomes the central focus in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the middle ground against a dark, textured background. The emblem is illuminated by a spotlight, creating a clear focus. As the camera pulls back and tilts downward, an empty pint-style drinking glass simultaneously rises into the foreground, coming into sharp focus. The glass is centrally positioned on a flat, black rectangular surface in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the transitions, maintaining a consistent perspective as the focus shifts from the emblem to the glass."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
