  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a single, stylized atomic structure positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. This structure, composed of a central cluster of pink and blue spheres with smaller orange spheres orbiting it, occupies the center. The camera steadily and smoothly zooms out from this atomic nucleus, revealing that the central object is one of many identical structures. As the view zooms out, the single cluster multiplies and arranges itself into a grid that fills the screen. The grid becomes denser, with each individual cluster shrinking in size while the orange circles within them continue their orbiting motion. This transformation creates a visually striking and symmetrical display of geometric shapes. As the zoom progresses, these structures multiply and arrange themselves into an expanding grid pattern, eventually filling the entire frame from top to bottom and left to right. The final composition is a flat, tiled pattern of these synchronously animating structures, all in unison against the black void. The orange circles appear to orbit around the pink and blue ones, resembling the structure of an atom. The scene transitions as this single element replicates, expanding into a grid. This grid continues to multiply, eventually filling the entire view with a repeating, tiled pattern of the animated atomic structures. The transformation highlights the contrast and vividness of the colors, with the black background enhancing the dynamic and abstract visual composition.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a dynamic and abstract visual composition, beginning with a central cluster of overlapping, colorful circles in pink, blue, and orange hues. The orange circles appear to orbit around the pink and blue ones, resembling the structure of an atom. As the video progresses, it zooms out to reveal additional circles, organized into similar clusters arranged in a grid pattern. This transformation creates a visually striking and symmetrical display of geometric shapes against a black background, highlighting the contrast and vividness of the colors.",
    "Motion": "A central cluster of pink and blue circles is orbited by several smaller orange circles. The view then zooms out, causing the single cluster to multiply and arrange itself into a grid that fills the screen. As the zoom-out continues, the grid becomes denser, with each individual cluster shrinking in size while the orange circles within them continue their orbiting motion.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a single, stylized atom-like structure is centered. This structure is composed of a central nucleus of clustered pink and light blue spheres, with several smaller, textured orange spheres orbiting it. The scene transitions as this single element replicates, expanding into a grid. This grid continues to multiply, eventually filling the entire view with a repeating, tiled pattern of the animated atomic structures, all in unison against the black void.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a single, stylized atomic structure positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. This structure, composed of a central cluster of pink and blue spheres with smaller orange spheres orbiting it, occupies the center. The shot then continuously zooms out, revealing that the central object is one of many identical structures. As the zoom progresses, these structures multiply and arrange themselves into an expanding grid pattern, eventually filling the entire frame from top to bottom and left to right. The final composition is a flat, tiled pattern of these synchronously animating structures."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
