  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man with dark hair pulled back and stubble, slightly to the right of the center of the frame and in the foreground, holding a light-grey camcorder with \"DIGITAL\" printed on its side. The camcorder is also slightly to the right of the center, with its viewfinder to his eye. A dark, tilted lampshade with a visible lightbulb is partially visible in the top left of the frame and in the middle ground. The spatial framing of these elements remains static throughout the shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's eye level, employing a low angle to look up at him. Initially, the man looks through the camcorder with a focused expression, maintaining a steady hold on the device. The camera, using a shallow depth of field, focuses on the man in the foreground. This is a locked-on POV shot, positioned above another camera, facing the man's face. The camera moves left and right, following the man's movements, and this motion is unsteady with noticeable shaking. After looking away from the viewfinder, the man widens his eyes significantly. The overall setting is a dimly lit indoor environment, creating a shadowy atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "A man with dark hair pulled back and stubble is shown in a close-up, looking directly forward with wide eyes. He is holding a light-grey camcorder with \"DIGITAL\" printed on its side, and he appears to be looking through its viewfinder. Partially visible above and to the left of his head is a dark, tilted lampshade with a lightbulb inside.",
    "Motion": "The man, initially looking through the camcorder with a focused expression, maintains a steady hold on the device. After looking away from the viewfinder, he widens his eyes significantly.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, shows a dimly lit indoor setting. A black, cylindrical lampshade with a visible lightbulb is partially visible in the upper left. The primary focus is on a person holding a white camcorder with a black viewfinder, which has \"DIGITAL\" printed on it. The person's eyes widen during the shot. The overall lighting is dark, creating a shadowy atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
