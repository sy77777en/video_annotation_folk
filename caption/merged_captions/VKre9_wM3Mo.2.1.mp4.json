  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on the upper portion of a stylized, 3D rendering of a toilet, which occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground against a solid black background. The toilet is dark and semi-translucent with a subtle blue glow emanating from its base, and its open, rounded lid is positioned in front of the water tank. The camera moves slowly and smoothly at the subject's level, though the specific motion is difficult to discern due to the absence of background cues. From the top of the frame, a small, grey rectangular plate with two circular buttons—one large on the left and a smaller one on the right—descends and stops in the top center, positioned in the foreground just above the toilet. Simultaneously, six thin, colored wires extend upwards from the top of the toilet tank to connect to the central plate: under the large button are four wires—red, blue, green, and yellow—while under the smaller button are two wires—yellow and blue. The scene is minimalist and rendered in a 3D animation style. Overlay text \"[1,2,3,4]\" appears in the lower left corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
