  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle medium shot of a woman with light brown skin and long, curly hair that is a mix of brown and blonde, wearing a light-colored knit sweater, lying at the bottom of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The setting is a narrow indoor hallway within a residential environment, featuring beige walls and light wood flooring. A white door with a silver doorknob extends from the foreground to the center midground on the right side of the frame, while a white rectangular air vent with vertical slats is visible behind her in the center-left, both in the middle ground. The woman, appearing worried, sits on the floor near the door and looks upward. The camera, from an eye-level, high-angle perspective, focuses on her with a shallow depth of field and is slightly unsteady as it tilts up, tracking her as she stands up. This movement causes the camera angle to shift to a level view, making her appear larger in the frame. She glances at the doorknob, quickly grasps it with her right hand, and then aligns her right eye with the peephole. The shot transitions to a medium close-up at the subject's level, framing her in the center of the frame as she stands close to the door on the right. The lighting is even, and the overall color palette is muted. Focus tracking keeps the woman sharp throughout the shot. Ultimately, she steps back to face the door, maintaining her orientation toward it throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video features a woman with light brown skin and long, curly hair that is a mix of brown and blonde. She is wearing a light-colored knit sweater. At different points, she is seen sitting on the floor and looking upward, as well as standing close to a door and facing it. Her facial expression appears worried, and she is oriented toward the door throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The woman first sits on the floor near the door and looks upward. After glancing at the doorknob, she quickly grasps it with her right hand. She then stands up, aligns her right eye with the peephole, and ultimately steps back to face the door.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a narrow indoor hallway within a residential environment, featuring beige walls and light wood flooring. A white door with a silver-colored doorknob and deadbolt is positioned on the right. Next to the door, near the floor, is a white rectangular air vent with vertical slats. A person with long, curly hair, wearing a white sweater, is lying on the floor, looking up at the doorknob. She then stands up and places her right eye against the peephole. The lighting is even, and the overall color palette is muted.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a high-angle medium shot of a woman lying at the bottom of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A white door with a silver doorknob extends from the foreground to the center midground on the right side of the frame, while a white air vent is visible behind her in the center-left, both in the middle ground. The setting appears to be a house entrance. The woman reaches for the doorknob and then stands up. The shot transitions to a medium close-up at the subject's level, framing her in the center of the frame as she stands close to the door on the right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
