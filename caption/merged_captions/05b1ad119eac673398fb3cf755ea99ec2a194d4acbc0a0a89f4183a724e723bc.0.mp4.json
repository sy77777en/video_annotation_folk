  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a coastal seascape, capturing an expansive view of the ocean, rocks, and distant land. In the foreground, large, rugged rocks occupy the lower half of the frame, creating a textured appearance. In the middle ground, two larger rocks are partially visible, one on the left and one on the right. The sandy beach blends seamlessly between the rocks and the ocean. The ocean dominates the upper portion of the video, with waves continuously crashing against the rocks and shore, producing white foam. The background includes a faint outline of distant land under a clear sky with scattered clouds. The camera is positioned at hip level with a high angle, looking down at the beach scene. It employs deep focus, ensuring all elements, including the rocks and waves, remain sharp. The camera motion is characterized by a smooth, slow wobble, maintaining minimal shaking while capturing the scenery in front. The video beautifully captures an outdoor coastal scene during the day, featuring rocky outcrops and a wet beach where seawater gently flows over the sand and softly crashes against the rugged rocks. The rocks vary in size and display a mix of dark and light brown hues with a rough texture. The ocean is a deep blue, with white foam forming as the waves meet the shore. As the waves continue to hit the rocks, water is splashed into the air, creating a dynamic and lively scene. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the ocean, rocks, and sky, with no main subject, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale of the coastal setting.",

The camera motion is characterized by a smooth, slow wobble, maintaining minimal shaking while capturing the scenery in front.",
    "Subject": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the ocean, rocks, and sky. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on capturing the atmosphere and scale of the coastal setting, rather than a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a rocky beach with large boulders scattered along the shore. The ocean waves are seen crashing against the rocks, creating splashes and white foam. The background features a distant view of mountains under a partly cloudy sky. As the waves continue to hit the rocks, water is splashed into the air, creating a dynamic and lively scene.",
    "Scene": "The video beautifully captures an outdoor coastal scene during the day, featuring rocky outcrops and a wet beach where seawater gently flows over the sand and softly crashes against the rugged rocks. The rocks vary in size and display a mix of dark and light brown hues with a rough texture. The ocean is a deep blue, with white foam forming as the waves meet the shore. In the distance, a faint outline of land is visible under a clear sky dotted with a few clouds, conveying a serene and natural environment with the movement of the waves adding a dynamic element to the tranquil landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a coastal seascape, capturing an expansive view of the ocean, rocks, and distant land.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
