  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium-full shot, framing two human-like figures rendered in a distinct, low-poly, and faceted style in the foreground, one on the left and one on the right. These figures, which appear to be male and dressed in collared shirts, are heavily backlit by a warm, reddish-white glow that casts them mostly in silhouette, with their geometric forms defined by the light catching the edges of their surfaces. Their faces are indistinct. The camera, positioned at eye level, begins with a level angle and smoothly tilts downward slightly before moving upward. As the camera ascends, the angle shifts to a high angle, revealing a larger, dimly lit room filled with more figures in the background, some standing and others seated at simple, red-colored desks. These additional figures share the same low-poly, backlit appearance and are rendered in a grayish-white tone, with their features obscured by the strong backlighting and stylized design. The entire environment maintains a minimalist, abstract aesthetic, with the dark background punctuated by the red furniture and the glowing white figures. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the shot, transitioning into a wide shot that captures many people standing or sitting around, lacking a clear focal point. The two initial figures remain in the foreground, while numerous other figures and red desks populate the middle ground and background. All figures remain motionless, with the only movement in the video coming from the camera. A static \"[3]\" icon is visible as an overlay in the bottom left corner of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot begins with a level angle, focusing on two men in the foreground while the background is dark and blurred. The camera smoothly tilts down slightly as it begins to move upward. As it continues to ascend, the camera angle shifts to a high angle, with the background becoming brighter and the two men falling out of focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features several human-like figures rendered in a distinct, low-poly, and faceted style. Initially, two figures stand in the foreground, heavily backlit by a reddish-white light that casts them mostly in silhouette. Their forms, which appear to be male and dressed in collared shirts, are defined by the light catching the edges of their geometric surfaces. Their faces are indistinct. As the camera moves upward, more figures with the same low-poly, backlit appearance are revealed in the background. These additional figures are either standing or sitting at simple, red-colored desks. All the figures are rendered in a grayish-white tone, with their features obscured by the strong backlighting and stylized design.",
    "Motion": "The two figures in the foreground remain stationary as the camera initially tilts down slightly before moving upward. As the lights turn on, a larger room filled with more figures in the background is revealed, some standing and others seated at desks, all of whom are also motionless. The only movement in the video is from the camera.",
    "Scene": "Two stylized, low-polygon human figures stand in a dark, undefined space, strongly backlit by a warm, reddish-white glow that highlights their geometric forms. The scene then reveals a larger, dimly lit room filled with similar figures seated at red desks and chairs. The entire environment maintains a minimalist, abstract aesthetic, with the dark background punctuated by the red furniture and the glowing white figures. A small \"[3]\" icon is visible as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium-full shot, framing two figures in the foreground, one on the left and one on the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
