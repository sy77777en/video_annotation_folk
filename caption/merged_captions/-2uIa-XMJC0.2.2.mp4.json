  "merged_caption": "From a dynamic, first-person perspective, the shot is centered on a vertical smart lock mounted on a dark paneled door in a dimly lit indoor setting. A hand belonging to a Black person, with a red sleeve visible at the wrist, enters the frame from the bottom right foreground, moves toward the center to press a glowing blue button at the bottom of the lock, and then retracts, exiting from the bottom of the frame. The smart lock, outlined in blue light, displays the numbers \"1424\" vertically in white. In response to the button press, a light at the top of the device illuminates, and a semi-transparent, holographic projection of a man's head and upper body materializes, superimposed over the door in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. This man is white with short, dark hair and is shown in profile, looking to his right while holding a dark, rectangular object in his right hand. The hologram is tinged with blue and red light. The camera, using a deep focus with a large depth of field, begins with a high angle, which transitions to a level angle as it performs a slightly unsteady backward pull. The camera tilts slightly upward as it moves, starting slowly before accelerating into a faster backward movement and then coming to a stop. The holographic man turns his head to look at the dark rectangular object in his right hand and speaks as he does so.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot uses a deep focus with a large depth of field. It begins with a high angle, which transitions to a level angle as the camera performs a slightly unsteady backward pull. The camera tilts slightly upward as it moves, starting slowly before accelerating and then coming to a stop.",
    "Subject": "A hand belonging to a Black person, with a red sleeve visible at the wrist, reaches into the frame to press a glowing blue button on a vertical, rectangular smart lock. The black device, mounted on a dark paneled door, is outlined in blue light and displays the numbers \"1424\" vertically in white. After the hand retracts, a bright light shines from the top of the device, and a semi-transparent, holographic projection of a man materializes on the door. This man is white with short, dark hair and is seen in profile, looking to his right. He holds a dark, rectangular object in his right hand, and the hologram is tinged with blue and red light.",
    "Motion": "A hand reaches into the frame from the right and presses a blue button on a smart lock before retracting out of view. In response, a light at the top of the device illuminates, and a semi-transparent, holographic projection of a man materializes on the door. The projected man turns his head to look at the dark rectangular object in his right hand and speaks as he does so.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is directed at a dark, paneled wall in a dimly lit indoor setting. In the center of the wall is a vertical, rectangular digital panel with a glowing blue border. The panel displays the numbers '1424' vertically in a thin, blue font. A circular button at the bottom glows blue, and a sensor at the top shines with a bright white light. A semi-transparent, glowing blue and red overlay of a man in profile appears on the wall, looking toward the panel while holding a dark object.",
    "Spatial": "From a dynamic, first-person perspective, the shot is centered on a vertical smart lock mounted on a door in the background. A hand enters the frame from the bottom right foreground, moves toward the center to press a button at the bottom of the lock, and then retracts, exiting from the bottom of the frame. Following this action, a semi-transparent holographic projection of a man's head and upper body materializes, superimposed over the door in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. The hologram is shown in profile, positioned to the left of the smart lock's display, and faces toward the right of the frame. The camera tilts slightly upward and initially moves backward slowly, then accelerates into a faster backward movement before stopping."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
