  "merged_caption": "A stylized, animated heart is positioned in the center of the frame against a dark, nearly black background. The heart is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Numerous red and pink arteries and veins extend from the top of the heart, branching outwards across the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a static, straight-on view at the heart's height. While the heart's position within the frame remains fixed, it rhythmically contracts and expands in place, with the pace of its beating gradually accelerating throughout the scene. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The heart's design is abstract, focusing on bold colors and simplified forms rather than realistic details. Throughout the scene, the heart beats rhythmically, contracting and expanding, and the background is dark, which makes the heart and its surrounding structures stand out vividly.",

    "Subject": "The video features a stylized, animated depiction of a human heart that is depicted as beating. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. It is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The heart is centrally positioned, and its design is abstract, focusing on bold colors and simplified forms rather than realistic details.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a stylized, animated depiction of a human heart that is beating. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. The heart is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The background is dark, which makes the heart and its surrounding structures stand out vividly.",
    "Scene": "In a stylized animation, a pink and magenta heart is centered against a dark, nearly black background. The heart, detailed with bold outlines, has numerous red and pink arteries and veins extending from its top and branching outwards. Throughout the scene, the heart beats rhythmically, contracting and expanding.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
