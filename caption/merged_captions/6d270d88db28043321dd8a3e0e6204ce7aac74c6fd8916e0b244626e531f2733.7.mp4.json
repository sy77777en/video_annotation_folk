  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures an expansive waterscape under a twilight sky. A narrow, earthen spit of land, with numerous small, dark, elongated boats docked along its sides and a few low, dark structures, extends from the bottom center towards the center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Smaller, detached landmasses are visible to its left and right in the middle ground. The vast body of still water surrounds these land features, extending from the foreground to the background and reflecting the soft pink and lavender hues of the layered clouds in the sky, which occupies the top third of the frame in the background. In the distant background, a wide expanse of green land stretches horizontally, with a hazy line of low mountains on the far horizon. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scene, providing a high-angle view of the peninsula with boats docked along its shores. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves slowly to the left, revealing more of the water and the distant shoreline under a cloudy, dusky sky, causing the central spit of land and the elements on it to gradually shift slightly towards the right side of the frame. The video, filmed by a drone, captures the serene environment, focusing on the expansive and calm water, the elongated land formations, and the atmospheric, soft light of the dawn or dusk sky, rather than highlighting a specific object.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view of a peninsula with boats docked along its shores. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly to the left.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial waterscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive and serene environment, capturing the vast body of calm water, the elongated land formations dotted with numerous small, dark, slender boats, and the atmospheric, soft light of the dawn or dusk sky, rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is an aerial scenery shot overlooking a body of water with several small landmasses. The camera moves to the left, revealing more of the water and the distant shoreline under a cloudy, dusky sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive body of still water under a twilight sky filled with soft, layered clouds tinged with pink and lavender. A narrow, earthen spit of land extends into the water, with numerous small, dark, elongated boats docked along its sides. A few low, dark structures are situated on this spit. The water's surface mirrors the subdued colors of the sky. In the distance, beyond the water's surface, there is a vast expanse of green land. Further beyond this land, a hazy landmass with low mountains lines the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
