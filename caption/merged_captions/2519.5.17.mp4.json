  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects: an older man and a young boy. The older man, with gray hair and a weathered face, is positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, wearing a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. The boy, with short dark hair, is on the right in the foreground, shown from the shoulders up, with his back partly visible to the camera. Both are facing each other, suggesting a moment of communication or connection, with the man leaning slightly towards the boy, indicating attentiveness or concern. The scene is set in a dimly lit, warm, and intimate indoor environment, with soft lighting casting gentle shadows on neutral-colored walls. A partially visible framed picture appears when the man moves his head. The camera maintains a steady position at the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the midground. Initially, the man appears to be speaking or listening intently. As the video progresses, he raises his hand towards his mouth, appearing to be in thought or contemplation, and then lowers his hand, causing a slight shift in his posture as he leans slightly towards the boy. The background remains consistent, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a partially visible framed picture. The camera angle does not change, maintaining an over-the-shoulder perspective from behind the boy. The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the intimate atmosphere of the scene. The video is shot at eye level with a low angle, creating an upward perspective, and the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing the private and possibly significant moment between the subjects.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a dimly lit room. The environment is warm and intimate, with soft lighting casting gentle shadows. The walls are a neutral color, and a framed picture becomes partially visible when the elderly man moves his head. The scene captures two individuals, with the camera positioned behind the younger person, showing their upper body and the interaction with the elderly man. The lighting and close proximity suggest a private and possibly significant moment between the subjects.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects: an older man and a young boy. The older man is positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, while the boy is on the right in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
