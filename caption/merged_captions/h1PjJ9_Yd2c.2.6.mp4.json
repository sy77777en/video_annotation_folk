  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a young man with short, dark hair styled upwards is framed from the chest up, positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupying the foreground. He is wearing a white dress shirt and a striped tie. Initially, he looks directly at the camera with his hand near his mouth, appearing thoughtful. The camera is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the foreground. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere. The background is dimly lit, with a few indistinct objects visible, including a blue bottle and a dark object. The camera exhibits minor, slightly unsteady movement with some shaking, but no clear or intentional motion. The young man then shifts his gaze away, moving his right hand to gently touch his right ear, as if rubbing it, while slightly tilting his head to his right, maintaining a similar contemplative expression. The video is set indoors, likely in a room with muted lighting, suggesting a calm, introspective atmosphere. Although the desk and bottle are not prominently visible, the everyday environment is still conveyed through subtle details. The time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the soft, natural light filtering in, creating gentle shadows. The color palette is subdued, with neutral tones dominating the scene. The overall composition is simple, focusing on the interaction within the space, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
