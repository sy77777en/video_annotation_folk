  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a smartphone circuit board is held in the foreground of the frame by a pair of light-skinned hands. The left hand, which has a ring on the ring finger, is visible on the left and bottom, while the right hand enters from the right, holding a silver-colored screwdriver with a hexagonal handle. The screwdriver's tip, positioned in the center, initially points at the top camera lens on the board and then moves down to indicate the larger, middle lens. The person then uses the screwdriver to gently move the middle camera in a circular motion. This static, high-angle shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus fixed on the smartphone motherboard in the foreground. The board features a prominent, vertically aligned triple-camera module next to a square, silver-colored metal shield. A blurry white surface with indistinct components, including some wires and possibly the smartphone itself, occupies the background. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, providing an overhead POV shot for a top-down perspective.",

    "Camera": "This static, high-angle shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus fixed on the smartphone motherboard in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds a blue smartphone circuit board, which features a prominent, vertically aligned triple-camera module and a silver-colored metal shield. The right hand holds a silver-colored screwdriver with a hexagonal handle, using its pointed tip to touch and indicate the different camera lenses on the module. The left hand, which has a ring on the ring finger, steadies the circuit board during this close examination. The screwdriver's tip is shown pointing at the top lens and then the larger, middle lens.",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands holds a smartphone circuit board steady. A screwdriver held in the right hand points its tip at the top camera lens, then moves down to point at the larger, middle camera lens. The person then uses the screwdriver to gently move the middle camera in a circular motion.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a pair of hands holding a blue smartphone motherboard against a white surface. The board features a prominent triple-camera module with lenses arranged vertically, next to a square, silver-colored metal shield. A person uses a silver, metallic screwdriver with a hexagonal handle to point at and touch the different camera lenses on the module. In the background, slightly out of focus, are some wires and possibly the smartphone itself on the white surface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
