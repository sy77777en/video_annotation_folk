  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot focused on a vast desert environment. Initially, a white, weathered lighthouse with a dark-roofed lantern room is positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground from a low-angle perspective. A bed of large, smooth rocks fills the bottom of the frame, while a clear, light-blue sky occupies the top background. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at the structure, then executes a continuous upward and forward movement, panning slightly to the left and tilting downward. This motion transitions the view from a low angle to a high angle, revealing a vast, rocky desert landscape characterized by grayish-brown boulders, ridges, and a barren white terrain behind the lighthouse. As the camera rises, the view changes to reveal an expansive landscape of hazy, rolling desert mountains and pale sand dunes stretching to the horizon. The lighthouse remains in the foreground, still slightly left of center, occupying approximately three-quarters of the frame in height. Meanwhile, the visible sky at the top gradually diminishes, with the blue sky disappearing and leaving only a strip of white sky near the horizon. The entire scene is kept in sharp, deep focus, emphasizing the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The lighthouse serves as a focal point that accentuates the vastness of the surrounding landscape, making the environment itself the primary subject.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, aerial shot of a lighthouse in a desert. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at the structure. It then moves upward and forward, simultaneously panning slightly left and tilting down. This motion transitions the view from a low angle to a high angle, revealing the vast, rocky desert landscape behind the lighthouse. The entire scene is kept in sharp, deep focus.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of an arid, desert environment. A tall, weathered white lighthouse with a dark-roofed lantern room stands centrally on a bed of large, smooth rocks, while the view slowly elevates to reveal a vast expanse of hazy, rolling desert mountains and pale sand dunes stretching to the horizon under a clear, light-blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The lighthouse serves as a focal point that accentuates the vastness of the surrounding landscape, making the environment itself the primary subject.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a tall, white lighthouse situated in a desolate, rocky desert landscape. In the background, vast, pale mountains stretch into the hazy distance under a clear sky. The camera slowly rises, revealing more of the expansive and arid environment.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a low-angle shot looking up at a weathered, cylindrical lighthouse tower, which has a lantern room with a dark-colored roof. The drone then moves upward and forward, slightly panning to the left and tilting downward, transitioning the view from a low angle to a high angle. This reveals a vast, rocky desert landscape behind the lighthouse, characterized by grayish-brown boulders, ridges, and a barren white terrain. Initially, the background features a clear light blue sky, but as the camera continues its movement, the blue sky gradually disappears, leaving only a white sky in the frame.",
    "Spatial": "This video captures a wide scenery shot focused on a vast desert environment. Initially, a white lighthouse is positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground from a low-angle perspective. A bed of large rocks fills the bottom of the frame, while a clear sky occupies the top background. The camera then executes a continuous upward and forward movement, panning slightly to the left and tilting downward, altering the viewpoint. As it rises, the view changes to reveal an expansive landscape of desert mountains and dunes. The lighthouse remains in the foreground, still slightly left of center, occupying approximately three-quarters of the frame in height. Meanwhile, the visible sky at the top gradually diminishes, with the blue sky disappearing and leaving only a strip of white sky near the horizon."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
