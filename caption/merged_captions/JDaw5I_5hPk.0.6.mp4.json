  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, frames two dark, wet sea lions interacting at a weathered wooden dock situated in greenish water. One sea lion is positioned in the upper center of the frame, lying on its stomach on the dock in the middle ground, propped up on its front flippers, with its head raised and mouth wide open, showing its teeth and the pink interior of its mouth. A second sea lion is in the bottom center, with its upper body emerging from the water in the foreground, its head and neck extended upwards, looking at the one on the dock. Its mouth is also open, and its long whiskers are visible. Both animals appear to be vocalizing at each other. The weathered wooden dock extends horizontally across the middle ground, featuring a metal cleat, with an algae-covered piling standing on the right. The sea lion in the water creates splashes and ripples as it looks up toward the roaring sea lion on the dock. This slow-motion video is captured from a high angle above the water. The camera, which has a slightly unsteady upward tilt, uses a shallow depth of field to keep the seals in the midground in focus. As the sea lion on the dock continues to vocalize, the one in the water splashes again before moving away from the dock.",

    "Subject": "Two dark, wet sea lions are interacting on and around a wooden dock. One sea lion is lying on its stomach on the dock, propped up on its front flippers. It has its head raised and its mouth wide open, showing its teeth and the pink interior of its mouth. In the water below, a second sea lion has its head and neck extended upwards, looking at the one on the dock. Its mouth is also open, and its long whiskers are visible. Both animals appear to be vocalizing at each other.",
    "Motion": "A sea lion on a wooden dock raises its head and opens its mouth wide toward another sea lion in the water below. The sea lion in the water looks up with its mouth also open, splashing and creating ripples. As the sea lion on the dock continues to vocalize, the one in the water splashes again before moving away from the dock.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime scene, two dark sea lions interact at a weathered wooden dock situated in greenish water. One sea lion rests on the dock's surface, which features a metal cleat, while the other is partially submerged in the water beside it, creating splashes. A thick, algae-covered piling stands on the right side of the dock. Both animals are positioned with their mouths open, facing one another.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, frames two sea lions at a wooden dock. One sea lion is positioned in the upper center of the frame, lying on the dock in the middle ground and roaring towards the other sea lion. A second sea lion is in the bottom center, with its upper body emerging from the water in the foreground. The weathered wooden dock extends horizontally across the middle ground, with an algae-covered piling standing on the right. The sea lion in the water creates splashes as it looks up toward the roaring sea lion on the dock."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
