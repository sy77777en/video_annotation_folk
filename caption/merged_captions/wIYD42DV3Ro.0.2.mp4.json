  "merged_caption": "At the beginning, a wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subjects, shows a group of horses and jockeys in the top center-left of the frame, racing on a dirt track that curves from the top center-right towards the bottom left. The green grass infield occupies the right and center of the frame. A graphical overlay is positioned in the bottom left corner, identifying the event as the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" and listing several horses with their numbers and odds, such as \"4 SUMMER IS TOMORROW 36-1,\" \"6 MESSIER 7-1,\" and \"16 CYBERKNIFE 14-1,\" with small icons representing the jockey's silks. In the top right corner, another graphic displays the race progress, showing \"1/4 MILE 21.78\" and later \"1/2 MILE 45.36,\" next to the NBC peacock logo. The camera initially tracks backward to follow the horses. As they pass underneath, the camera rolls counterclockwise and then trucks left with a slight upward tilt, continuing to follow their movement along the track. The dirt track occupies the upper portion of the frame while the green grass infield is at the bottom, with the pack spreading out slightly. The camera quickly zooms in slightly, then rolls counterclockwise and pans to the left, while also trucking left, following the horses as they race in the same direction, maintaining a relatively tight formation. The deep focus keeps the entire field of horses clear. A video filmed by a drone captures a horse race in progress on a wide, light-brown dirt track that curves to the left. Inside the track, a green grass infield is visible. A group of horses with jockeys in colorful silks gallops along the track.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a horse race in progress on a wide, light-brown dirt track that curves to the left. Inside the track, a green grass infield is visible. A group of horses with jockeys in colorful silks gallops along the track. Overlays are present on the screen. In the bottom left corner, a graphic for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" lists the names, numbers, and odds for several horses. In the top right corner, another overlay shows a race timer and a network logo.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
