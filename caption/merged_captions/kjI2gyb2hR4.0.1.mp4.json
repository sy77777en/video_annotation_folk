  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a middle-aged, heavy-set man with fair skin and grey, thinning hair, positioned in the center of the frame, primarily in the foreground. He has a full, white beard that appears to be a prop, covering his chin and jawline, and wears a white collared shirt under a brown vest. Pushed up on his forehead is a pair of dark, steampunk-style goggles with metallic rims, with a small, complex mechanical device attached to one of the lenses. The indoor scene is set in a dimly lit room with a noticeable green tint, with shelves lining the top, left, and right sides of the frame. A vintage television is visible in the background on the left, while a boombox is situated on the right, contributing to the appearance of a workshop or storage area. The man looks forward, speaking while making slight head movements. As he talks, his eyes widen and his eyebrows raise for emphasis, then return to a more neutral expression. His body remains relatively stationary throughout the clip. As he speaks, he leans forward, maintaining his position in the foreground, and gestures with his hands while using facial expressions to emphasize his points. The shot simultaneously tightens to a medium close-up, highlighting his movement and expression. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene, employing a smooth, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. It uses a varying Dutch angle as it moves forward and rolls clockwise, finishing with a slight pan to the right. His expression predominantly remains serious and intense, with subtle eyebrow movements and moments when his eyes open wide as he looks forward and speaks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
