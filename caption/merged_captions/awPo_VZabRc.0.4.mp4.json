  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from an eye-level perspective, moving rapidly forward through the center of a train car aisle, with blurred passengers on the left and right. The camera moves forward rapidly and then slows dramatically, revealing a man with a police badge. The movement is very smooth with no shaking. The zooming effect then gradually slows down, transitioning to a static close-up, focusing on a man in a suit who is now centered in the frame. This central figure is a man with a chiseled, angular face, gray-toned skin, and a stern expression. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a dark tie. A police-style badge is pinned to his left lapel. Another passenger is visible on the left side, a person with dark skin wearing a green vest with a white letter \"D\" on it, while the head of a different person with brown hair appears over the main subject's right shoulder. Other indistinct figures are located on both the left and right sides of the aisle. The scene unfolds inside the narrow aisle of a moving train car, depicted in a stylized, hand-drawn animation. The interior is characterized by overhead fluorescent light panels, windows, and handrails. The color scheme is muted with a greenish-blue tint. The camera remains at the main subject's eye level, and the man in the suit stands motionless in the aisle, along with the other passengers surrounding him. To the right of the main subject, on the left side of the frame, there is a person with dark skin wearing a navy and light green coat featuring a light green \"05\" on it.",

    "Subject": "The video, rendered in an animated style, begins with a blurry, fast-motion perspective of a crowded train car before focusing on a main subject. This central figure is a man with a chiseled, angular face, gray-toned skin, and a stern expression. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a dark tie. A police-style badge is pinned to his left lapel. He stands in the aisle, surrounded by other passengers who are less distinctly drawn. To his left is a person with dark skin wearing a green vest with a white letter \"D\" on it. To the right of the main subject, on the left side of the frame, there is a person with dark skin wearing a navy and light green coat featuring a light green \"05\" on it. Another individual with brown hair is partially visible over the main subject's shoulder.",

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds inside the narrow aisle of a moving train car, depicted in a stylized, hand-drawn animation. The interior is characterized by overhead fluorescent light panels, windows, and handrails. The scene starts with a disorienting, high-speed motion blur that transitions into a clearer view of the passengers. A man with angular features, dressed in a dark suit, white collared shirt, dark tie, and a badge on his lapel, stands prominently in the aisle. Other passengers are visible, some holding onto poles for support. The color scheme is muted with a greenish-blue tint.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
