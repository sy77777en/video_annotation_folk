  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot from a chest-mounted camera, a man with a reddish-brown beard in a bright yellow wingsuit with blue zippers occupies the bottom-center foreground. His hands are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right, gripping black risers that extend upward. The camera, facing towards his face, maintains a low angle throughout, capturing his expressions and the background scenery with deep focus and a large depth of field. In the middle ground, a white parachute with black lettering spelling \"Go Pro\" is centered at the top of the frame, initially partially open. As the parachute deploys, the man's head is initially thrown backward. Once stabilized, he grips the parachute's risers with both hands, and his body sways gently as he floats downwards past a steep cliff face, generally looking forward against the bright sun and blue sky. As he looks up, his head moves into the center of the frame, and the parachute fully inflates, dominating the upper half. The background consists of a blue sky, steep canyon walls on the far right, and the sun in the top right, which creates a prominent lens flare. The scene takes place outdoors on a clear, sunny day within a deep canyon, flanked by steep, dark rock faces. The bright blue sky is visible above, with the sun causing a significant lens flare as the person holds onto the black parachute risers. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the skydiver's expressions and the background scenery with deep focus and a large depth of field, keeping both elements sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot with the camera mounted on the skydiver's chest, facing towards their face, maintaining a low angle throughout. The footage captures the skydiver's expressions and the background scenery with deep focus and a large depth of field, keeping both elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man with a reddish-brown beard is seen from a low-angle view, captured by a camera mounted on his chest, as he looks up towards the sky. He is wearing a bright yellow wingsuit with blue zippers on the chest, a helmet, and dark-lensed goggles. His hands are gripping the black risers of a white parachute that is open and inflated directly above him. The parachute has black lettering on its surface, spelling \"Go Pro.\"",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle, chest-mounted camera perspective, a person in a wingsuit descends under a fully deployed parachute. As the parachute deploys, their head is initially thrown backward. Once stabilized, they grip the parachute's risers with both hands, their body swaying gently as they float downwards past a steep cliff face, generally looking forward against the bright sun and blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, mounted on a person, captures the perspective of looking up from a bright yellow jumpsuit as a white parachute with black lettering inflates overhead. The scene takes place outdoors on a clear, sunny day within a deep canyon, flanked by steep, dark rock faces. The bright blue sky is visible above, with the sun causing a significant lens flare as the person holds onto the black parachute risers.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
