  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a monochromatic, daytime scene set on a city rooftop, overlooking a busy street with early 20th-century traffic. A paused 3D animation of a partially constructed film set is visible on top of a building. As the perspective shifts to a vintage camera view, the scene resumes, showing a man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a dark tie, hanging from the hands of a large clock face mounted on the side of an adjacent building. The man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, in the middle ground, on a structure attached to a building facade, while a distant city street occupies the background on the right. A temporary cyan geometric overlay is superimposed over the man and the structure. The shot then changes to a wide shot, with the camera now positioned at the man's level. In this new framing, the man becomes the central subject, hanging and swinging in the middle ground, with the building facade to his left and the background street still visible to the right. The very smooth, aerial, high-angle shot moves forward and downward, slightly to the left, while panning right, approaching the man hanging from the clock. As the camera gets closer, the scene appears somewhat blurred due to a blurring effect. However, a deep focus is then applied, ensuring the entire scene, from the rooftop in the foreground to the city street in the background, becomes sharp and clear by the end. The camera then pauses, holding its position. The man clings to the clock's hands with both of his hands, his body suspended in the air with his legs dangling below him, kicking his legs in the air as he struggles to maintain his grip.",

    "Subject": "In a black and white video, a man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a dark tie, appears to be hanging from the hands of a large clock face. The clock is seemingly mounted on the exterior wall of a tall building, high above a city street. However, this dramatic scene is an illusion created by a set constructed on the roof of a tall building. The man clings to the clock's hands with both of his hands, his body suspended in the air with his legs dangling below him.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a paused 3D animation of a partially constructed film set on top of a building. As the perspective shifts to a vintage camera view, the scene resumes, showing a man in a suit already hanging from the hands of a large clock face mounted on the side of the building, kicking his legs in the air as he struggles to maintain his grip.",
    "Scene": "A monochromatic, daytime scene is set on a city rooftop, overlooking a busy street with early 20th-century traffic. In the background, multi-story buildings line the street, one of which has a sign that reads \"ABSOLUTELY FIRE-PROOF.\" The rooftop in the foreground contains a small, two-tiered metal platform. A man is seen hanging from the hands of a large clock face on the side of an adjacent building. A cyan-colored geometric overlay, forming a rectangle and triangles, is temporarily superimposed on the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a rooftop set in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
