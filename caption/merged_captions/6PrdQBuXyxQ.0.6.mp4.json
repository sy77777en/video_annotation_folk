  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman with fair skin and blonde hair styled in a bun is positioned centrally in the frame, consistently looking slightly upward against a backdrop of jagged, rocky peaks in a mountainous landscape at dawn or dusk. She is wearing a white, translucent hooded jacket over a dark top, along with a black backpack featuring orange strings that go through the shoulder straps. A circular logo is visible on the left sleeve of her jacket. Initially shown in profile, she looks toward the left side of the frame. As the camera arcs clockwise around her in an unsteady, eye-level shot with a level angle, she slowly turns her head to face slightly leftward, maintaining a slightly upward gaze throughout. Her chest and shoulders rise and fall subtly as she breathes deeply, while her body remains otherwise stationary. The camera keeps her in focus in the foreground with a shallow depth of field, capturing her focused expression as she looks upward and forward with a slight turn of her gaze.",

    "Subject": "A woman with fair skin and blonde hair styled in a bun is shown from the chest up and at a level angle. She is wearing a white, translucent hooded jacket over a dark top, along with a black backpack featuring orange strings that go through the shoulder straps. A circular logo is visible on the left sleeve of her jacket. Throughout the video, she breathes deeply, looking upward and forward with a slight turn of her gaze and a focused expression.",

    "Scene": "In a mountainous landscape at dawn or dusk, a woman with blonde hair tied in a bun stands against a backdrop of jagged, rocky peaks. The sky is pale. She wears a white, translucent hooded jacket and a black backpack with orange strings that go through the shoulder straps. A circular logo is visible on the left sleeve of her jacket.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned centrally in the frame, consistently looking slightly upward against a backdrop of mountains. Initially shown in profile, she looks toward the left side of the frame. As the camera arcs clockwise, she turns her head to face more toward the right side of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
