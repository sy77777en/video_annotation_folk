  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a man in a blue shirt in the right foreground as he pops a purple water balloon, which is positioned directly above his hands. The resulting splash of water expands outward from the point of impact around him in the foreground. On the left side of the frame, three other men are visible: one in a white hat is positioned in the middle ground, another in glasses is in the foreground, and a third man is partially visible on the far left in the foreground. Two pieces of a red, deflated balloon are suspended in the air in the center of the middle ground. The background is filled with dense green trees. This video is captured with a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion as a man in a blue shirt stabs a water balloon. Filmed from a low, hip-level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in sharp focus. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right while simultaneously moving down. The scene takes place on a sunny day in a backyard, with a paved surface in the mid-ground. The area is enclosed by a dense background of lush green trees and foliage, with ivy seen climbing one of the tree trunks. In the background, a wooden ladder and a few cinder blocks are visible. A purple water balloon is captured at the moment of impact, bursting into a spray of water droplets that catch the sunlight. Two deflated red balloons are also visible in the air. At the very beginning of the video, two red, deflated balloon pieces fall slowly through the air. To the left, three men watch the event; one, wearing a white hat, stands with his arms raised, another in a white t-shirt and glasses looks on, and a third man, partially visible, sports a beard, a grey t-shirt, and dark shorts.",

    "Subject": "The main subject is a man in a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and a backward red baseball cap, who is in the process of popping a purple water balloon with a knife held in both hands, causing water to splash around him. Positioned to the left of the frame are three other men watching. The man in the center of the group has a beard and wears a white graphic t-shirt, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat, standing with his arms raised. Next to him stands a man in a white t-shirt, dark shorts, and glasses. A third man with a beard is partially visible on the far left. Two pieces of a red, deflated balloon are visible in the middle ground.",
    "Motion": "In a video featuring a speed ramp effect, a man in a blue t-shirt and red cap thrusts a knife upward with both hands, piercing a purple water balloon. The balloon instantly bursts, sending a large splash of water exploding outward around him. At the very beginning of the video, two red, deflated balloon pieces fall slowly through the air. To the left, three men watch the event; one, wearing a white hat, stands with his arms raised, another in a white t-shirt and glasses looks on, and a third man, partially visible, sports a beard, a grey t-shirt, and dark shorts.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
