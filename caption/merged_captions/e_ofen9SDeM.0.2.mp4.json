  "merged_caption": "The video begins with the top of an elderly man's head visible in the center of the frame, emerging from behind tall grass in the foreground. He has long, wispy white hair and a full white beard. As he walks forward up a grassy hill, the shot size transitions to a medium shot, revealing his torso and the two large, beige cloth sacks he carries, one in each hand. He is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt, brown trousers, and suspenders. The camera starts with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the grass in the foreground, and then smoothly transitions its focus to the man in the middleground. As the man moves into the foreground, the camera consistently keeps him in focus. He remains centered, moving from the middle ground toward the camera. The camera slightly tilts up as the man climbs the hill, and as he moves closer, the focus naturally shifts to his lower body. In this final composition, his legs are centered, and the two sacks he holds are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame as he continues to walk forward. The background features rolling green hills in soft focus. The sequence begins with the camera at a slightly high angle, which then adjusts to a level angle, remaining at ground level throughout the entire shot. The scene is set in a vast, windswept field of tall green grass, and the man emerges from over a small rise, moving towards the camera. As he ascends, his full torso comes into view, revealing that he is carrying the sacks. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent focus on him as he progresses up the hill.",

    "Subject": "An elderly man with long, wispy white hair and a full white beard is shown walking up a grassy hill. He is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt, brown trousers, and suspenders. Initially, only his head and shoulders are visible, but as he moves forward, his full torso is revealed. He is already holding two large, beige cloth sacks, one in each hand, which become visible as he ascends further up the hill. The focus then shifts to his lower body, showing his legs and the two sacks he carries.",

    "Scene": "In a vast, windswept field of tall green grass, an elderly man with a long white beard and hair emerges from over a small rise. Dressed in a blue shirt, suspenders, and brown trousers, he carries two light-colored burlap sacks as he continues to climb the hill. The background features rolling green hills.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
