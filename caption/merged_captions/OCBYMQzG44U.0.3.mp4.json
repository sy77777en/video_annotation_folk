  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot within a 3D game, viewed from a first-person point of view. The camera is positioned at eye level, at a high angle, and uses deep focus, looking down into an indoor pool area. The scene begins with the camera smoothly trucking left while panning right, revealing a backroom-style setting. A prominent red waterslide is positioned on the left side of the frame, curving downwards from the upper left towards the lower center, situated in the middle ground. Partially obscured behind it, a green waterslide is also on the left, in the middle ground. The pool water occupies the lower-middle area of the frame, also in the middle ground. A metal railing extends diagonally from the bottom left middle ground towards the center-right middle ground. A light-colored, grid-patterned platform is in the bottom right foreground. White tiled walls form the background, particularly visible in the upper half of the frame. In the top right background, another metal railing appears after the camera pans to the right, near a simple doorway. The scene is relatively dimly lit, revealing white tiled walls, with some sections featuring a reflective, textured tile pattern. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay of these elements, highlighting the atmosphere and design of the space.",

    "Camera": "In this 3D game scene, the camera is at eye level, positioned at a high angle, and uses deep focus. From a first-person point of view, it smoothly trucks left while panning right, revealing a backroom-style setting with waterslides.",
    "Subject": "The video presents an indoor recreational scenery shot, depicting a pool area with large, brightly colored waterslides. A prominent red waterslide curves downwards towards a pool of water, partially obscured by a metal railing in the foreground. Behind it, a green waterslide is also visible. The surrounding area features white tiled walls and what appears to be a tiled platform or walkway with a grid pattern. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay of these elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the atmosphere and design of the space.",
    "Motion": "This video features a first-person point of view within a 3D game, showcasing an indoor pool area. The camera moves left while simultaneously panning right, revealing two waterslides, one red and one green, leading into the pool. The scene is viewed from a tiled platform overlooking the pool.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down into an indoor pool area within a 3D game. The scene is relatively dimly lit, revealing white tiled walls, with some sections featuring a reflective, textured tile pattern. Dominating the left side are large, smooth, tubular waterslides; a prominent red one curves downwards towards the dark blue or teal water of the pool, with a portion of a green slide visible behind it. A metal railing runs along the edge of a platform in the middle ground, which has a light-colored, grid-patterned surface. Another metal railing encloses a section of the pool area in the background, near a simple doorway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
