  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, centered on a large, dark, reddish-brown silhouette of a fantastical, multi-limbed creature positioned in the center, with two smaller creatures, one white and the other brown, perched atop its head or shoulders, each with a large, shaking tail. The creature's lower half is a thick, twisting, trunk-like form, from which white, root-like appendages sprout, and its upper torso features four long, thin, spider-like arms, two on each side, ending in sharp points. From the creature's peak, a stream of small, white, bubble-like particles continuously rises toward a bright orb of light located at the top center of the frame in the background. The large, silhouetted creature and the two smaller figures perched on it are visibly shaking, either partially or with their entire bodies. The background is composed of layered, rounded silhouettes resembling mountains or large flora under a hazy, pink and purple sky, while delicate, plant-like shapes are visible in the foreground at the bottom. An overlay of white text reading \"October 15, 2024\" is positioned in the upper-middle portion of the scene, situated between the creature and the light source. The camera then executes a very smooth pull-back shot, moving backward away from the central silhouetted figure, transitioning to a wide shot that makes the central creature and its environment appear smaller within the frame.",

    "Subject": "A large, dark, reddish-brown silhouette of a fantastical creature is centrally located. The creature's lower half is a thick, twisting, trunk-like form, from which white, root-like appendages sprout. Its upper torso features four long, thin, spider-like arms, two on each side, ending in sharp points. Perched atop this creature's head or shoulders are two smaller creatures, one white and the other brown, each with what appears to be a large, shaking tail. A stream of small, white, bubble-like particles rises from the top of the large creature.",
    "Motion": "The large, silhouetted creature and the two smaller figures perched on it are visibly shaking, either partially or with their entire bodies. Meanwhile, a stream of small, white, bubble-like particles continuously rises upward from the top of the large creature, ascending toward a bright light in the sky.",
    "Scene": "In a stylized, outdoor landscape under a hazy, pink and purple sky, a bright orb of light shines from the top center. The background is composed of layered, rounded silhouettes resembling mountains or large flora. A large, dark silhouette of a multi-limbed figure stands in the center, from which small, white particles float upwards toward the light source. Delicate, plant-like shapes are visible in the foreground. An overlay of white text reading \"October 15, 2024\" is positioned in the upper-middle portion of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, centered on a large, multi-limbed creature positioned in the center, with two smaller figures perched on top. From the creature's peak, a stream of white particles rises toward a bright orb of light located at the top center of the frame in the background. Layered, mountain-like silhouettes are present in the background, while delicate plant shapes are visible in the foreground at the bottom. White text appears in the upper-middle portion of the frame, situated between the creature and the light source, displaying \"October 15, 2024.\" The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a wide shot that makes the central creature and its environment appear smaller within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
