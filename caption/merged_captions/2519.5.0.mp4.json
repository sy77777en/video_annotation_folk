  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot. A man with short, dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath, occupies the center middle ground in a dimly lit indoor setting, characterized by a shadowy and mysterious atmosphere. Positioned in front of a beam of light originating from the top right background, he moves from the right to the center and turns to face the camera, already holding a hammer. The environment appears to be a workshop or mechanical space, with industrial elements and a yellow garment hanging in the left background. A complex mechanical device with visible wires and metal components sits in the bottom center foreground. The man leans forward, striking the device with the hammer. After removing a part of the device, he drops it and continues to search through the machine. He then squats down, stands back up, and turns his head angrily to his left, which corresponds to the right side of the frame, remaining in the center middle ground. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device, with dust particles visible in the air. The camera remains at eye level, creating a level angle perspective with the viewer's gaze, and features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground while the background and foreground remain blurred. The camera exhibits minor, slightly unsteady movements with some shaking, but lacks clear or intentional motion. The overall color palette is dark, with muted tones and subtle contrasts between light and shadow, enhancing the focus on technical or mechanical work.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man in a dimly lit setting with short, dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath. He is using a hammer to strike a complex mechanical device with visible wires and components. After removing a part of the device with the hammer, he drops it and searches through the machine. He then squats down, stands up, and turns his head angrily to his left, which is the right side of the frame. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit room, a man moves from the right to the center and turns to face the camera, already holding a hammer. He starts hitting the mechanical device in front of him. After removing a part of the device, he drops it and continues to search through the machine. The man then squats down, stands up, and turns his head angrily to his left, with the light illuminating his face and the device.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim lighting, creating a shadowy and mysterious atmosphere. The environment appears to be a workshop or mechanical space, characterized by industrial elements. A beam of light cuts through the darkness, highlighting dust particles in the air. The walls are obscured, but a yellow garment hangs in the background, adding a splash of color. The scene includes machinery with visible wires and metal components, suggesting a focus on technical or mechanical work. The overall color palette is dark, with muted tones and subtle contrasts between light and shadow.",
    "Spatial": "This is a medium shot. A man occupies the center middle ground, positioned in front of a beam of light originating from the top right background. A complex mechanical device sits in the bottom center foreground. A yellow garment hangs in the left background. The man initially leans forward, striking the device in the foreground with a hammer. He then drops the hammer, briefly squats down, stands back up, and turns his head towards his left, which corresponds to the right side of the frame, remaining in the center middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
