  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames a man's upper body in the center middle ground, seated behind a wooden table that occupies the bottom third of the frame in the foreground. A man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses wears a grey t-shirt with a leaf pattern. A red ceramic cup filled with white milk rests on a white saucer in the center foreground on the table, with a black smartphone to its right and slightly behind the cup. The man initially holds a chocolate chip cookie in the center of the frame, directly above the cup, before releasing it. As the cookie falls vertically into the cup, he picks up the smartphone from the right foreground and holds it in the center, between himself and the cup. The video employs a distinctive speed ramp effect, keeping the man's movement in the mid-ground at normal speed while significantly slowing down the motion of the cookie when he releases it. In slow motion, the cookie plunges into the milk, sending a crown-shaped splash of liquid upwards from the cup in the center foreground. The man holds the phone steady, pointing it at the splash. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action, with a shallow depth of field keeping the focus on the cookie and milk in the foreground. The scene is set against a solid black background, providing a stable and consistent perspective throughout the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, eye-level shot with a level angle. The video employs a distinctive speed ramp effect, keeping the man's movement in the mid-ground at normal speed while significantly slowing down the motion of the cookie when he releases it. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the cookie and milk in the foreground, while the fixed camera provides a stable and consistent perspective throughout the scene.",
    "Subject": "A man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table. He wears a grey t-shirt with a leaf pattern. In front of him, a red ceramic cup filled with white milk rests on a white saucer, next to a black smartphone. The man holds a chocolate chip cookie over the cup, drops it into the milk, and then picks up his phone to photograph the resulting splash. The video captures the cookie falling and the milk splashing upwards in a crown shape in slow motion.",
    "Motion": "A man holds a cookie over a red cup of milk and then releases it. As the cookie falls, he picks up a smartphone from the table and aims it at the cup.

    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a scene is set on a wooden table. In the center, a red ceramic cup filled with white liquid rests on a white saucer. A chocolate chip cookie is dropped into the cup, creating a large, detailed splash of liquid that is captured in slow motion. Initially, a black smartphone is placed on the table, but it is then picked up to photograph the splash as it happens.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
