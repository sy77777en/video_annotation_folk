  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, two white swans are positioned in the middle ground on an icy, snow-covered bank next to a body of dark, rippling water. The swan on the left stands left of center, initially with its long neck curved back, tucking its head into its feathers, before lifting its head and extending its neck. The swan on the right, positioned right of center, faces the camera and flaps its large white wings, holding them outstretched before folding them back in. Both swans have dark beaks and are reflected in the dark water in front of them. The snowy bank and background occupy the top half of the frame, with a body of water in the bottom half. The background is a uniform expanse of white snow under an overcast sky, with out-of-focus leafless shrubbery framing the scene in the foreground on the bottom and right. Shot from a high angle, this video uses shallow focus, concentrating primarily on the swans and their snowy and watery surroundings. The camera remains static but exhibits a slight unsteadiness.",

    "Camera": "Shot from a high angle, this video uses shallow focus, concentrating primarily on the swans and their snowy and watery surroundings. The camera remains fixed but exhibits a slight unsteadiness.",
    "Subject": "Two white swans are positioned on the edge of an icy, snow-covered bank next to a body of water. The swan on the left initially stands in profile with its long neck curved back, tucking its head into its feathers, and then eventually stretches out its neck. The swan on the right faces the camera and flaps its large white wings, holding them outstretched. Both swans have dark beaks and are reflected in the dark water in front of them.",
    "Motion": "A white swan on the right, standing on an icy bank, flaps its wings and then folds them back in. To its right, another swan initially stands with its head tucked into its back before lifting its head and extending its neck.",
    "Scene": "In a stark winter landscape, two white swans stand at the edge of a body of dark, rippling water. The bank is covered in white snow and a layer of ice where it meets the water. One swan stands still with its head tucked back, while the other faces the viewer and spreads its large white wings. Their faint reflections are visible on the water's surface. The background is a uniform expanse of white snow under an overcast sky, with out-of-focus leafless shrubbery framing the scene in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, two white swans are positioned in the middle ground on an icy bank. The swan on the left stands left of center, while the swan on the right, which flaps its wings, is positioned right of center. The snowy bank and background occupy the top half of the frame, with a body of water in the bottom half. Blurred branches frame the scene from the foreground on the bottom and right. The camera remains static and is positioned above the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
