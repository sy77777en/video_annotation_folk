  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium shot, capturing the front of a Porsche with a distinctive split-color livery as it moves from the bottom right towards the top left of the frame. The driver's side is red with a large white circle containing the text \"+30°\" in red, while the passenger's side is blue with a white circle featuring \"-30°\" in blue text. The word \"PORSCHE\" is written in white capital letters across the top of the windshield, and a hashtag, \"#Drive2Extremes,\" is visible on the blue side. The camera then pulls back and lowers to the car's height, transitioning to a full shot that frames the vehicle in the center foreground as it drives towards the viewer, with snow-covered ground in the foreground and background trees on the right. The car speeds forward and drifts sideways around a turn on a snow-covered track, kicking up snow as its wheels spin. Following a rapid high-angle shot of the car's roof, the camera drops back to the car's level and moves alongside it, framing the vehicle's blue side in a medium shot as it drifts from the left side of the frame to the center. The video then transitions to a full shot of the car, filmed from its right rear side. A drone camera smoothly tracks the Porsche as it drives on the snowy track, beginning at a high, eye-level angle, arcing clockwise around the front of the car. The camera quickly cranes up to an overhead view and back down to a hip-level, level-angle shot as it repositions to track the car from its side. A deep focus with a large depth of field keeps both the car and the snowy environment in sharp detail throughout the dynamic movements.",

    "Subject": "The video features a Porsche car with a distinctive split-color livery. The driver's side, which is the left side of the car, is red, and the passenger's side is blue, with a white stripe running down the center of the hood and roof. On the red side of the hood, a large white circle contains the text \"+30°\" in red. Correspondingly, the blue side features a white circle with \"-30°\" in blue text. The word \"PORSCHE\" is written in white capital letters across the top of the windshield. A hashtag, \"#Drive2Extremes,\" is visible in white on the blue side of the car. The vehicle's German license plate reads \"S VQ 1016 E\". The car is shown from various angles, including a top-down view, a front view, and side views.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone follows a Porsche sports car as it drifts at speed across a vast, snow-covered landscape. The car features a distinctive split livery, with one side blue and marked \"-30°\" and the other red with \"+30°\". The dynamic camera shots capture the vehicle from various angles—overhead, from the front, and alongside—as its tires kick up clouds of white snow. In the background, a dense forest of snow-dusted evergreen trees lines the track under a bright, clear sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
