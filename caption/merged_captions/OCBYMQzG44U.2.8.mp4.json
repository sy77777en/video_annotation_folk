  "merged_caption": "This video captures a dynamic, first-person perspective of an interior architectural scene. The camera moves forward and pans to the right around the corner, revealing the entire space. The composition is at eye level, emphasizing the vastness of the empty, tiled room. A tiled wall occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, while the tiled floor covers the bottom half. A curved portion of the right wall is prominent in the right foreground. Along the top right, a row of square ceiling lights recedes into the background. In the background, a bright vertical light source is positioned slightly left of center, with a dark, arched entryway to its right. A metal railing stands in the middle ground on the right, in front of the entryway. The video features a dynamic, first-person, eye-level perspective as the camera pans rightward around the corner to reveal a large, empty room that resembles a drained swimming pool. The entire space, including the walls and floor, is covered in small, off-white tiles. The room is brightly illuminated by square lights in the ceiling and a glowing vertical slit in the far wall, creating a sterile and minimalist atmosphere. The shot deliberately lacks a main subject, instead using the wide, distorted perspective to emphasize the immense scale, eerie emptiness, and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself. The space is lit by a row of square lights embedded in the ceiling and a bright light source from an opening in the distance. Toward the back of the room, a short section of metal railing stands before a dark, arched doorway. The wide-angle perspective makes the walls appear to curve inward. A deep focus keeps the entire tiled room sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a smooth, first-person perspective at eye-level, with mild barrel distortion noticeable at the edges of the frame. A deep focus keeps the entire tiled room sharp. The camera moves forward before executing a quick pan to the right.",
    "Subject": "This is an interior architectural scenery shot of a vast, empty, and sterile tiled room. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, giving the space a uniform and slightly disorienting quality under a pale, greenish-yellow glow cast by a row of recessed ceiling lights. In the distance, a bright vertical slit of light cuts into a far wall, contrasting with a small, dark, arched entryway guarded by a simple metal railing. The shot deliberately lacks a main subject, instead using the wide, distorted perspective to emphasize the immense scale, eerie emptiness, and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a long, empty room entirely surfaced with small, square, pale green tiles, creating a uniform grid pattern across the floor, walls, and a curved ceiling. The space is lit by a row of square lights embedded in the ceiling and a bright light source from an opening in the distance. Toward the back of the room, a short section of metal railing stands before a dark, arched doorway. The wide-angle perspective makes the walls appear to curve inward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
