  "merged_caption": "The scene opens on an interior setting with a wooden chair visible in the right background and a metallic rocking horse in the left background. A light-skinned human hand enters from the top left of the frame and places a worn, dark brown teddy bear with a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching on the floor in the center foreground. The bear features mismatched eyes: one large, dark, four-holed button and one smaller, dark bead, with a brown, flat, round bead for a nose, and wears a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. The shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing on the bear's upper body, which now occupies the center of the frame. The background elements, including a wooden dressing table with a round, vintage mirror centrally placed and a wall adorned with delicate floral patterns, become out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field. The camera, employing a static, ground-level shot from a level angle, initially focuses on the background before executing a rack focus to bring the teddy bear in the foreground into sharp view. As the bear sits stationary, a hand enters from the top of the frame and places a dark gray, soft cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, on the bear's head, complementing its button eye. The hand then moves out of view. Throughout this sequence, the camera remains at the bear's eye level, capturing the warm, soft glow of the dimly lit room and the cozy ambiance created by the wooden floor.",

    "Subject": "A worn, dark brown teddy bear is the central subject. The plush bear has a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching, giving it an aged appearance. It features mismatched eyes: one is a large, dark, four-holed button, while the other is a smaller, dark bead. A brown, flat, round bead forms its nose. Around its neck is a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. A light-skinned human hand places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, complements the bear's button eye.",
    "Motion": "A hand places a teddy bear in the center of the frame, bringing it into focus. The same hand then enters from the top and places a dark gray cap on the bear's head before moving out of view.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room with a warm, soft glow, a worn, pinkish-brown teddy bear with mismatched button and bead eyes and a faded pink scarf is gently placed on a dark surface by a hand. The scene begins with an interior view featuring a wooden dressing table with a round, vintage mirror centrally placed in the background. To the right, a wooden high-back chair is visible, while a metallic rocking horse sits on the left. The background wall is adorned with delicate floral patterns, and the wooden floor adds to the cozy ambiance. As the scene progresses, the background softly blurs, drawing focus to the teddy bear.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
