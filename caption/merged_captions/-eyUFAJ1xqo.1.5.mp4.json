  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with dark hair styled in a bun, wearing a white, long-sleeved robe or shirt with black trim along the collar, is positioned in the left middle ground, while a man with short dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing an unbuttoned black shirt and dark pants, starts in the left foreground and moves to the center middle ground. They stand before a large, patterned wall with a repeating geometric pattern of stylized, eye-like shapes that occupies the background. The scene is set in a dark, indoor space, initially illuminated entirely in deep red light emanating from the wall. As the subjects sway their bodies and move their arms rhythmically in place, they briefly turn to face each other before continuing to dance. The lighting on the left portion of the background wall transitions to a vibrant blue, moving from left to right, creating a stark contrast against the remaining red-lit areas. The camera, at an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, starts with a slight backward motion, pauses briefly, and then smoothly pans from right to left while continuing to move backward, following the two dancers. The entire room is bathed in a deep red light, with the pattern on the wall backlit in the same red hue. As the scene progresses, a section of the wall's backlighting transitions to a vibrant blue, creating a stark contrast against the remaining red-lit areas. The man and woman exchange glances and continue dancing together, their forms largely silhouetted by the intense, shifting colors.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping both the dancers and the patterned background sharp. The camera starts with a slight backward motion, pauses briefly, and then smoothly pans from right to left while continuing to move backward, following the two dancers.",
    "Subject": "A man and a woman stand close to each other in a dimly lit setting. The man has short dark hair and a full dark beard. He is wearing an unbuttoned black shirt, exposing his bare chest, and dark pants. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, might have her dark hair styled in a bun and is wearing a white, long-sleeved robe or shirt with black trim along the collar. They exchange glances and continue dancing together.",
    "Motion": "A man and a woman dance next to each other in a room with a patterned, illuminated wall. They sway their bodies and move their arms rhythmically in place. They briefly turn to face each other before continuing to dance as the lighting on the wall behind them shifts from red to a mix of red and blue.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, indoor space dominated by a wall with a repeating geometric pattern of stylized, eye-like shapes. The entire room is bathed in a deep red light, with the pattern on the wall backlit in the same red hue. As the scene progresses, a section of the wall's backlighting transitions to a vibrant blue, creating a stark contrast against the remaining red-lit areas. Two figures, one in light-colored clothing and the other in dark, are positioned in front of the wall, their forms largely silhouetted by the intense, shifting colors.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the left middle ground, while a man starts in the left foreground and moves to the center middle ground. They stand before a large, patterned wall that occupies the background. The scene is initially illuminated entirely in red light emanating from the wall. As the subjects dance subtly in place, the lighting on the left portion of the background wall transitions to blue, moving from left to right. The camera begins with a slight backward motion, pauses briefly, and then smoothly pans from right to left while continuing to move backward, following the two dancers."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
