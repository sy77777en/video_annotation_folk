  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a young, light-skinned boy with short, light-brown hair and a slender, athletic build is positioned in the center-right middle ground of a well-lit indoor diving facility. He is shirtless, wearing blue swim briefs with a dark blue pattern, and has black guards on both wrists. He holds a small, crumpled purple and pink cloth in his left hand. A white tiled wall occupies the right side of the frame, while a large red banner with white text reading \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" and \"WE ARE TEAM USA\" is visible in the left middle ground, next to a small wooden table. In the left background, a multi-level diving platform structure and spectators seated in distant bleachers can be seen. The camera, positioned at the subject's hip level, leads the boy from the front, moving backward with noticeable shaking, maintaining a parallel alignment with the ground and using deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The boy walks forward at a steady pace along the tiled wall, initially moving toward the camera before turning to his left and continuing to the left side of the scene, moving toward the center of the frame and closer to the camera. As he walks, a dark, semi-transparent graphic overlay appears across the bottom of the screen, displaying information for a diver named \"JOSHUA HEDBERG,\" including his total score, round number, difficulty, and individual judge scores. In the latter part of the video, the facility's ceiling, equipped with several bright white lights, significantly enhances the overall lighting.",

    "Camera": "This is an unsteady, hip-level shot that leads a young male diver from the front, moving backward with noticeable shaking. The camera maintains a parallel alignment with the ground, using deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned boy with short, light-brown hair and a slender, athletic build walks forward. He is shirtless and wears blue swim briefs with a dark blue pattern. He has black guards on both of his wrists and holds a small, crumpled purple and pink cloth in his left hand.",
    "Motion": "A young boy walks forward at a steady pace along a tiled wall in a diving facility, holding a small cloth in his left hand. He initially moves toward the camera before turning to his left and continuing to the left side of the scene.",
    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set indoors at a well-lit diving facility. A high, white-tiled wall runs along the right side of the view. To the left and in the background, a multi-level diving platform structure is visible, with spectators seated in distant bleachers. A large red banner with white text reading \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" and \"WE ARE TEAM USA\" is positioned on the left, next to a small wooden table. Metal railings line the walkways and platforms. In the latter part of the video, the facility's ceiling is equipped with several bright white lights that significantly enhance the overall lighting. Initially, the dark, semi-transparent overlay at the bottom of the screen is not visible but appears during the second half of the video, displaying information for a diver named \"JOSHUA HEDBERG,\" including his total score, round number, difficulty, and individual judge scores.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
