  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a 3D-animated scene in a high-tech setting, featuring a large, translucent cylinder with a glowing, solid, blue-green core on a dark, angular base, occupying the right side of the frame in the foreground. The scene is set on a dark, gridded floor intersected by glowing red and green lines. In the middle ground, a small hammer with a wooden handle and a metal head is visible in the bottom left quadrant, suspended in the air. Further in the background, a coordinate axis system made of red, blue, and green spheres connected by short rods is located in the top left. A small metal nail protrudes from the cylinder's base, positioned near the lower center of the frame. The camera, filmed from a high angle, moves smoothly forward, approaching the nail and the glass cylinder on the ground. As the camera moves closer, a small notch becomes visible on the transparent surface just above the nail. The view zooms in on the base of the cylinder, focusing on the small nail protruding from its side. Cracks begin to form on the cylinder's surface, originating from a point slightly above the nail and spreading outward across the translucent material. The camera then trucks left while panning right to keep the damaged area of the cylinder in view, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the area of the cylinder just above the nail. In this final framing, the nail is at the bottom of the frame, and the center is occupied by cracks forming on the cylinder's surface. The hammer and the coordinate axis system in the background remain stationary. A text overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the number '[25].'",

    "Camera": "This is a 3D animated shot filmed from a high angle. The camera moves smoothly forward, approaching a nail and a glass cylinder on the ground. The focus is shallow, tracking the point of impact on the cylinder. After stopping its forward motion, the camera then trucks left while panning right to keep the damaged area of the cylinder in view.",
    "Subject": "In a 3D-animated scene, a large, translucent cylinder with a glowing, solid, blue-green core stands on a dark base. A small metal nail protrudes from the side of the translucent cylinder near its bottom. As the view focuses on this area, cracks begin to form and spread across the surface of the translucent material. In the background, a small hammer with a wooden handle and a metal head is suspended in the air directly in front of the nail. Nearby, an object resembling a coordinate axis system is composed of red, blue, and green spheres, each representing an axis, and they are perpendicular to each other, connected by short rods.",
    "Motion": "The view zooms in on the base of a large, translucent cylinder, focusing on a small nail protruding from its side. As the camera moves closer, cracks begin to form on the cylinder's surface, originating from a point slightly above the nail and spreading outward across the translucent material.

    "Scene": "In a high-tech setting, a scene unfolds on a dark, gridded floor intersected by glowing red and green lines. A large, transparent cylinder containing a glowing turquoise core rests on a dark, angular base. Nearby, a coordinate axis system with red, blue, and green axes connected by short rods is visible. A small nail is embedded in the side of the cylinder's base, and a small notch becomes visible on the transparent surface just above it as the camera moves closer. A hammer floats in the air next to the nail. A text overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the number '[25].'",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a 3D-animated scene. A large, translucent cylinder occupies the right side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. In the middle ground, a small hammer is visible in the bottom left quadrant. Further in the background, a coordinate axis system made of colorful spheres is located in the top left. A small nail protrudes from the cylinder's base, positioned near the lower center of the frame. The camera then moves forward and downward, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the area of the cylinder just above the nail. In this final framing, the nail is at the bottom of the frame, and the center is occupied by cracks forming on the cylinder's surface. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
