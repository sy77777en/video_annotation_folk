  "merged_caption": "A wide shot shows the interior of a greenhouse from a static, ground-level perspective. In the foreground and middle ground, dark soil fills the bottom two-thirds of the frame, with several black irrigation hoses running horizontally from left to right across the scene. A few wooden planks are placed on the soil, with one in the bottom right foreground and another in the center middle ground. In the background, a large mass of green plants with very large, heart-shaped leaves and thick vines occupies the top portion of the frame, stretching from the left to the right side. The arched structure of the greenhouse, with its translucent covering, is visible at the top and sides of the frame. This time-lapse video is captured from a fixed but slightly unsteady camera, positioned at a high angle, ground level. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse, from the irrigation lines in the foreground to the large plant in the background, in sharp detail. The time-lapse captures the dynamic growth of the plants, creating an engaging scene as the large, leafy plants grow at the far end. The structure of the greenhouse, with its arched, translucent covering, is visible at the top of the scene. The dark, tilled soil is arranged with several parallel black irrigation hoses running horizontally across the width of the greenhouse. A few flat, light-brown wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil, perpendicular to the hoses. The video shows a static shot from inside a greenhouse, where large, leafy plants grow at the far end and irrigation hoses are laid out on the soil in both the foreground and middle ground. The time-lapse captures the dynamic growth of the plants, creating an engaging scene.",

    "Subject": "Inside a long, tunnel-shaped greenhouse with a translucent covering, a large patch of lush, green plants with very large, heart-shaped leaves grows at the side away from the camera. These plants have thick vines that spread out from a central point. In the foreground and middle ground, the dark, tilled soil is arranged with several parallel black irrigation hoses running horizontally across the width of the greenhouse. A few flat, light-brown wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil, perpendicular to the hoses.",

    "Scene": "A high-angle view from inside a long greenhouse shows a bed of dark soil stretching into the distance. At the far end, a large, sprawling plant with very large, green leaves and thick vines dominates the space. Running horizontally across both the foreground and middleground of the soil bed are several parallel black irrigation hoses. A few flat, light-brown wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil, perpendicular to the hoses. The structure of the greenhouse, with its arched, translucent covering, is visible at the top of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
