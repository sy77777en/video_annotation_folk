  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle close-up, where a person's arm extends from the left foreground to hold a small, bright red, square-shaped bucket in the center of the frame. The person, who has a dark skin tone, is wearing a dark, long-sleeved garment, with a silver-colored bracelet on their right wrist and a black object on their left wrist. The scene is set in a dimly lit, narrow indoor space, enclosed by translucent plastic sheeting with a vertical partition in the middle ground, creating a narrow depth. A bright light source from the right side illuminates the scene, casting shadows and creating a hazy glow. The video has a vintage, low-fidelity quality with a noticeable reddish tint and horizontal scan lines, all contained within black framing bars on all four sides. The person's hands tilt the red bucket, causing a clear liquid to pour out in a splashy stream that cascades downward through the middle of the scene, splashing onto the wet floor. The unsteady, shaky camera cranes up in an arc, transitioning from a hip-level, level angle to an eye-level, bird's-eye view, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement. In this final framing, the person's arms are positioned in the bottom left of the frame, reaching toward the center to tilt the bucket. The perspective shifts to a bird's-eye angle view, looking down as the static scene remains unchanged, with the camera capturing the liquid cascading downwards, illuminated by the light source from the right.",

The person, who has a dark skin tone, is wearing a dark, long-sleeved garment. A silver-colored bracelet is on their right wrist, and a black object is visible on their left wrist.

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit, narrow indoor space, a person's arms hold a red, square container, pouring water that splashes onto the wet floor. The area is enclosed by what appears to be translucent plastic sheeting, with a vertical partition down the center. A bright light source from the right side illuminates the scene, creating a hazy glow and casting shadows. The video has a vintage, low-fidelity quality with a noticeable reddish tint and horizontal scan lines. The entire scene is presented within black framing bars on all four sides, which are an overlay on the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle close-up, where a person's arm extends from the left foreground to hold a red bucket in the center of the frame. The scene is divided by a vertical partition in the middle ground, with translucent sheeting in both the foreground and middle ground creating a narrow depth. The camera then cranes upward, shifting the perspective to a bird's-eye angle view. In this final framing, the person's arms are positioned in the bottom left of the frame, reaching toward the center to tilt the bucket. The liquid cascades downward through the middle of the scene, illuminated by a light source from the right. The entire scene is contained within black framing bars on all four sides."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
