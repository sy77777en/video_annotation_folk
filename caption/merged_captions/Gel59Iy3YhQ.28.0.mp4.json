  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera is positioned below a large, white block structure that dominates the foreground from the center to the top and right of the frame. In the extreme foreground, a white block being held is visible in the bottom-right corner. The background on the left and top of the frame shows a blue sky with clouds, while a distant landscape is visible in the bottom-center background. A small avatar with orange hair and a green shirt is fixed in the top-left corner, an inventory bar is at the bottom-center, and button prompts are at the bottom-right. The central crosshair aims up at the structure, and some blocks are placed in the center, extending the structure toward the viewer. The camera transitions from a level angle to a low angle as it tilts upward, maintaining a smooth, aerial perspective with deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The first-person view in the sandbox game moves slightly forward and tilts up, then moves backward as blocks are placed. Finally, it moves forward again to destroy the excess blocks, making them shatter into particles that expand outward from the center of the screen. The scene is set during the daytime, with a clear blue sky and blocky white clouds. The game's user interface is present, with a hotbar at the bottom showing various blocks, including white, glowing blue, diamond, and red types. The small character model in the upper left corner, performing actions, is also an overlay element. The player places a white block onto a large structure in the sky and then breaks the newly placed excess blocks, causing them to shatter and explode into a cloud of smaller white particles that fly outward before disappearing.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place high in the sky within a Minecraft world. The scene is set during the daytime, with a clear blue sky and blocky white clouds. The viewpoint is focused on a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks, which has a layered design. In the distance below, a green landscape is visible. During the clip, some white blocks are placed onto the structure, and the excess ones are then broken, causing them to shatter into small particles. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom center, an inventory hotbar displays various blocks, with the white block selected. In the bottom right, controller prompts for \"Place,\" \"Mine,\" \"Drop,\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small black crosshair is centered on the screen. The small character model in the upper left corner, performing actions, is also an overlay element.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
