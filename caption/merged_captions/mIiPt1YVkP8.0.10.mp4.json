  "merged_caption": "This wide shot begins with two airplanes, \"UAL 1118\" on the left and \"UAL 863\" on the right, positioned in the middle ground on a dark runway at night, marked with yellow and white lines. The scene is illuminated by a series of bright, white runway lights along the edge of the tarmac, casting a glow on the aircraft. Above each plane, glowing white text displays its flight number. The camera, positioned at a level angle with a deep focus, arcs clockwise while simultaneously zooming out, revealing two additional airplanes, \"PAL 115\" and \"UAL 1,\" appearing sequentially to the right of the initial two. The movement, which has a slight, unsteady shake, speeds up before slowing to a stop, showing all four airplanes lined up from left to right across the middle ground. The first airplane is a narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1118,\" the second is a larger, wide-body jet labeled \"UAL 863,\" the third is a narrow-body jet labeled \"PAL 115,\" and the fourth is another narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1.\" All four planes are positioned along a yellow dashed line on the tarmac, with the fourth airplane slightly angled more to the right compared to the others. In the foreground, the runway and a large grassy area are visible, with a row of runway lights extending from the right-center bottom toward the right of the frame. The background is characterized by a completely black sky.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle with a deep focus, the camera arcs clockwise and zooms out to reveal four airplanes lined up on the runway instead of the initial two. The movement, which has a slight, unsteady shake, speeds up before slowing to a stop.",
    "Subject": "Four light-gray passenger airplanes are lined up on a dark runway at night, which is illuminated by runway edge lights. Each airplane has a glowing white text label above it, identifying its flight number. From left to right, the first airplane is a narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1118.\" The second is a larger, wide-body jet labeled \"UAL 863.\" The third is a narrow-body jet labeled \"PAL 115,\" and the fourth is another narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1.\" All four planes are positioned along a yellow dashed line on the tarmac, with the fourth airplane slightly angled more to the right compared to the others.",
    "Motion": "Four airplanes are stationary in a line on a runway at night. The camera arcs clockwise and zooms out, sequentially revealing each aircraft: UAL 1118, UAL 863, PAL 115, and UAL 1.",
    "Scene": "At an airport at night, four gray airplanes are lined up on a dark runway marked with yellow and white lines. The scene is illuminated by a series of bright, white runway lights along the edge of the tarmac, casting a glow on the aircraft. Above each plane, glowing white text displays its flight number: \"UAL 1118,\" \"UAL 863,\" \"PAL 115,\" and \"UAL 1.\" The camera arcs clockwise and zooms out, revealing each successive plane in the queue against a completely black sky.",

The camera, positioned at a level angle, arcs clockwise while simultaneously zooming out. This movement reveals two additional airplanes, \"PAL 115\" and \"UAL 1,\" appearing sequentially to the right of the initial two.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
