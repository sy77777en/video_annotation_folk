  "merged_caption": "This is a handheld, medium close-up, over-the-shoulder shot with noticeable shaking, capturing an older person, seen from behind, occupying the right foreground. In the middle ground, a young man with dark, curly hair and a light complexion stands on the left side of the frame, wearing a blue t-shirt with diagonal stripes and looking toward the older person with a serious expression. To his left, on the right side of the frame, stands a young woman with long, dark brown hair and a light complexion, dressed in a pink top and a necklace, also looking toward the older individual with a concerned expression. They are positioned in front of a large, bright window in the background, which is flanked by dark horizontal blinds on the far left. The scene is set within a dimly lit room with a desaturated color palette, where the window serves as the primary light source, backlighting the two younger individuals and revealing an out-of-focus residential exterior during the daytime. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a level, eye-level shot with a deep focus that keeps all three characters in the frame relatively sharp. The camera exhibits slow, unsteady movement with some shaking, suggesting a handheld shot. The three individuals in the frame remain stationary, with the young man and woman facing the older person, who is seen from the back, wearing a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt. The camera's unsteady movement and the stationary posture of the subjects create a tense atmosphere, emphasizing the serious and concerned expressions of the younger individuals as they engage with the older person in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set within a dimly lit room with a desaturated color palette. A large, bright window serves as the primary light source, backlighting two younger individuals and revealing an out-of-focus residential exterior during the daytime. To the left of the window, dark horizontal blinds are visible against the wall. The foreground character, whose back is to the camera, wears a dark suit jacket, while the two people they face stand close together in the natural light from the window.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
