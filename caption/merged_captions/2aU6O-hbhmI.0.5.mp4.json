  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level angle, filmed by a drone providing a high-altitude perspective of a dense cityscape during a colorful sunset. Initially, the red lattice arm of a large construction crane is positioned in the foreground, extending from the top right to the center of the frame. The camera moves forward, flying close to the long, red lattice arm of the crane, providing a sweeping panorama of the urban landscape. A second red crane stands in the distance against the vibrant sky, silhouetted against a sky painted with brilliant orange, yellow, and pink clouds that transition to a cool teal color higher up. Below, the urban environment is filled with numerous modern high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, with some lights visible in the windows as evening approaches. The camera maintains a level angle but rolls slightly clockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle, and features mild barrel distortion while using a deep focus to keep the entire urban landscape sharp. The foreground crane's arm sweeps across the top of the frame, revealing more of the urban environment below and altering the composition of the shot. The scene is filled with a dense collection of modern skyscrapers and buildings, their lights beginning to twinkle, emphasizing the theme of a city in a state of constant growth and development. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the urban environment, using the prominent cranes to highlight the dynamic cityscape scenery shot from a high, sweeping perspective during a vibrant sunset.",

    "Camera": "This smooth, aerial-level drone shot flies forward through a cityscape at sunset. The camera maintains a level angle but rolls slightly clockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot features mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus to keep the entire urban landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from a high, sweeping perspective during a vibrant sunset. The camera moves alongside the immense, red lattice structure of a construction crane, which frames the view of a sprawling urban center below. Another crane is visible in the distance, silhouetted against a sky painted with brilliant orange, yellow, and pink clouds that transition to a cool teal color higher up. The scene is filled with a dense collection of modern skyscrapers and buildings, their lights beginning to twinkle as evening approaches. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the urban environment, using the prominent cranes to emphasize the theme of a city in a state of constant growth and development.",
    "Motion": "This is a high-angle, wide-shot view of a modern cityscape during a vibrant sunset or sunrise. The scene is dominated by two large, red construction cranes set against a backdrop of numerous high-rise buildings. The camera appears to be moving along the arm of the crane in the foreground, providing a sweeping panorama of the urban landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a high-altitude perspective of a dense cityscape during a colorful sunset. The sky transitions from orange and yellow at the horizon to a pale turquoise, with scattered clouds. The camera moves forward, flying close to the long, red lattice arm of a large construction crane in the foreground. A second red crane stands in the distance against the vibrant sky. Below, the urban environment is filled with numerous modern high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, with some lights visible in the windows.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level angle. Initially, the red lattice arm of a large construction crane is positioned in the foreground, extending from the top right to the center of the frame. A second crane is visible in the middle ground on the left, with a dense cityscape of skyscrapers filling the bottom and center of the frame. The camera moves forward, causing the foreground crane's arm to sweep across the top of the frame, revealing more of the urban environment below and altering the composition of the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
