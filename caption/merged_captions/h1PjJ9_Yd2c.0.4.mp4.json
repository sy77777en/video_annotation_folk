  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot framed over the shoulder of a blurred figure in the foreground on the right, capturing a slightly unsteady, over-the-shoulder POV shot from a level, eye-level perspective. In the middle ground, two men in matching sports uniforms, consisting of black sleeveless jerseys with a wide, horizontal yellow stripe and black shorts, walk towards the left on a large, green grass field under an overcast sky. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the players in the midground. As the shot continues, it transitions into a wide shot. A man jogs from the left into the center, briefly coming into focus before joining other players who run from the middle ground toward the background. The primary focus then shifts to this same man, wearing the number \"5\" on his back, as he moves from the left to the center-right, then turns left and runs towards the background alongside another player wearing the number \"10\" on his back. The camera initially pans to the right briefly, then alternates between panning left and right to track the players as they run on the field. In the background, two athletes walk or jog towards the left side of the frame. In the mid-ground on the right, an athlete holding a football faces the camera before exiting the frame to the right. A player wearing a jersey with the number \"5\" enters from the left side and begins to run across the field. He and the athlete holding the ball, who is wearing the number \"10\", then move away from the camera towards the left front. The blurred foreground element on the right remains static throughout the clip. A line of leafy green trees stands in the distance.",

    "Subject": "A group of young men are on a green grass field, all wearing matching sports uniforms. The uniforms consist of black sleeveless jerseys with a wide, horizontal yellow stripe across the chest, and black shorts. One of the men, seen from behind, has a white number \"5\" on his back and is the focus of the video for part of the time. Another man with a white number \"10\" on his back is also visible. A man with dark hair comes into focus briefly, smiling as he jogs. In the foreground on the right side of the frame, there is a blurred figure visible from the shoulders up. The men are walking and jogging across the field.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the view looks out onto a large, green grass field under an overcast sky. A line of leafy green trees stands in the distance. Several men in dark, sleeveless jerseys with a horizontal yellow stripe are seen walking and then running across the field, with the primary focus on these athletes in the mid-ground. One of the jerseys has the number \"5\" printed in white on the back. The right side of the view is partially obscured by the person the camera is following.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
