  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a vast interior wall. The shot begins with a low-angle perspective and transitions to a worm's-eye view as the slightly unsteady first-person camera tilts upward, capturing a tall wall covered in small, pale green square tiles. The tiled wall fills the majority of the frame, stretching diagonally from the bottom towards the top right. Embedded in the wall at various heights are multiple small, rectangular windows with white frames, all glowing with a bright, uniform white light. These windows are positioned across both the foreground and middle ground of the wall's surface. In the background at the top of the frame, a long, intensely bright light fixture runs horizontally, embedded in or adjacent to the ceiling, which is visible at the top edge. This light fixture casts a bright, hazy illumination over the entire surface, creating a sterile, surreal atmosphere and a sense of immense height. The camera captures the scene in deep focus with mild barrel distortion, emphasizing the overwhelming scale and repetitive, minimalist pattern of the environment, which evokes a sterile and surreal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific object.",

    "Camera": "The shot begins with a low-angle perspective and transitions to a worm's-eye view as the slightly unsteady first-person camera tilts up to look at a tiled wall and ceiling, all captured in deep focus with mild barrel distortion.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a disorienting, low-angle view looking up a vast, tiled wall. The wall, made of small, pale green tiles, is dotted with numerous identical, small rectangular windows that are brightly illuminated from within. A long, intensely bright light fixture runs along the top of the frame, casting a sterile, hazy glow over the scene and creating a sense of immense height. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overwhelming scale and repetitive, minimalist pattern of the environment, which evokes a sterile and surreal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "Motion": "The camera tilts upward, capturing a tall wall covered in small, light-colored tiles. Multiple small, rectangular windows are brightly illuminated, and a long light fixture is visible at the top of the frame.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, a tall interior wall stretches upwards towards a partially visible ceiling. The wall is uniformly covered in a grid of small, pale green square tiles. Embedded in the wall at various heights are multiple rectangular windows with white frames, all glowing with a bright, uniform white light. A long, linear light source at the top of the scene casts a bright, hazy illumination over the entire surface.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a vast interior wall.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
