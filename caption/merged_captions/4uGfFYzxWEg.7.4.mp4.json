  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot, maintaining a static frame throughout, in an indoor setting resembling a classroom or lecture hall with a minimalist, low-poly aesthetic. The room has dark gray walls, a light gray floor, and large, tall windows along one wall that let in diffuse light. Several rows of light brown wooden desks with light-colored frames are arranged, accompanied by matching chairs with dark brown seats and backs. In the bottom left middle ground, a green humanoid figure is seated at a wooden desk. Onscreen overlays are present in the bottom left corner, changing from \"[12]\" to \"[13]\". Further into the scene, in the center-left middle ground, a figure with a grey and red patterned top sits at a desk, and to its right, in the center middle ground, another figure in a red top is also seated at a desk with their head slightly bowed and their right hand supporting their head. Several empty wooden desks occupy the foreground and middle ground on the right. In the center-right middle ground, a standing grey figure is positioned near a white rectangular board on the left wall, with their right hand on their chin and left hand on their hip. To the left of this standing figure, in the center-right middle ground, two more grey figures are seated at a table. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, using deep focus to keep all elements in the scene sharp. It moves forward slowly and very smoothly, focusing on the central figure in a red garment. The overall lighting is even and subdued, and the camera is at the same height as the figures.",

    "Subject": "In a classroom setting, several stylized, low-polygon human figures are present. In the foreground on the left, a green, geometric figure sits at a wooden desk, facing away from the viewer. Further back, two gray, polygonal figures sit side-by-side; the one on the left wears a purplish shirt, while the one next to it wears a red jacket. In the back of the room, a gray, polygonal figure stands with one hand to its chin, as if presenting. To the right of the standing figure, two other gray, polygonal figures are seated at their own desks.",
    "Motion": "The video depicts a room with six stylized, low-polygon humanoid figures. Five are seated at wooden desks arranged in rows, while one figure stands facing the whiteboard with their right hand on their chin and left hand on their hip. The camera gradually moves forward, focusing on the central figure in a red garment, who is sitting with their head slightly bowed and their right hand supporting their head. The figure on the left is green, the central figure is wearing red, the figure next to them is in a mix of gray and red, and the remaining three figures in the distance are gray. Large windows allow natural light to enter the room.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a classroom or lecture hall, featuring a minimalist, low-poly aesthetic. The room has dark gray walls and a light gray floor, with large, tall windows along one wall that let in diffuse light, though the outside view is obscured. Several rows of light brown wooden desks with light-colored frames are arranged, accompanied by matching chairs with dark brown seats and backs. At the front, a white rectangular board, possibly a whiteboard, is mounted on the wall. Six low-poly, monochromatic human figures are present: five are seated at desks throughout the room, and one stands. The overall lighting is even and subdued. An overlay of white text appears in the lower-left corner of the frame, changing from \"[12]\" to \"[13]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
