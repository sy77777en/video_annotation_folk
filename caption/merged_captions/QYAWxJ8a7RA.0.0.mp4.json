  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, dynamic scenery shot captured from a ground-level perspective in a serene, rural town at either sunrise or sunset. The textured pavement, which sparkles with light, occupies the entire foreground and the bottom half of the frame. Positioned at ground level, the camera smoothly dollies backward while tilting down, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the glistening street surface in the midground in focus. In the middle ground, a two-story house is positioned on the left, while a taller, tower-like structure stands slightly to the left of the center. Other buildings are visible to the right and further back in the middle ground. The background is composed of rolling hills that stretch across the upper portion of the frame, with a large, brilliant sun located in the top center, just above the horizon, casting a warm, hazy glow. Small, dark particles, like ash or snow, drift slowly downwards throughout the scene, adding to the atmospheric lighting. The surrounding hilly landscape is covered in snow, enhancing the serene and desolate mood of the town. The composition emphasizes the overall mood and environment, with the camera's backward motion revealing the deserted street and the gentle falling of particles, creating a tranquil yet dynamic visual narrative.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a serene, rural scene of an empty street in a snow-covered town at sunrise or sunset. The shot features a level perspective, showcasing clearly visible buildings, including a two-story house and a central tower, lining the road against a backdrop of rolling hills. A large, brilliant sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm, hazy glow and causing the textured pavement in the foreground to sparkle, while small, dark particles drift down through the air. The composition emphasizes the overall mood and environment, with a medium depth of field highlighting the texture of the ground and the atmospheric lighting rather than any specific building or character.",
    "Motion": "This is a ground-level, level-angle shot of a street in a desolate, snow-covered town at sunrise or sunset. The camera moves slowly backward throughout the clip. The only discernible motion is the gentle falling of small, dark particles, like ash or snow, through the air.",
    "Scene": "A level-angle shot captures a deserted town at either sunrise or sunset. The camera is positioned on a textured ground surface with dark corners, covered in small, glistening particles. In the distance, several buildings, including a clearly visible two-story house and a taller structure with a small tower, stand against a bright, glowing sun on the horizon. The surrounding hilly landscape is covered in snow, and small, white granular drifts float throughout the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
