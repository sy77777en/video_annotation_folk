  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide, top-down shot of a stylized white ship positioned in the bottom center of the frame and a glowing red dot in the upper left, both in the middle ground. A dashed red line extends diagonally between them. An overlay includes a compass icon fixed in the bottom left corner, with coordinate displays showing \"LONG\" at the top center and \"LAT\" on the right center, both values steadily increasing. The camera smoothly moves upward, tilting down and rolling counterclockwise, to achieve a bird's-eye view of the 2D digital map. The scene is set against a black, textured background resembling dark water, with a white grid overlay providing coordinates, surrounded by a white, scaled rectangular frame at the edges of the video. The ship, depicted with an attached lifeboat, remains stationary as the longitude and latitude coordinates displayed on the screen steadily increase. As the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, a large, red dashed square is drawn in a clockwise direction, starting from the left side of the frame and eventually enclosing the ship and the red dot in the center. The scene is overlaid with a white grid and a white, rectangular frame with markings that enhance the visual structure. A glowing, red dashed line extends from the bow of the ship toward the small, glowing red dot. As the video progresses, a large, red dashed square forms, enclosing both the ship and the red dot. The camera remains positioned directly above the scene throughout, maintaining a consistent top-down perspective.",

    "Subject": "A stylized, white ocean liner is shown from a top-down perspective on a black, textured background that resembles dark water. The scene is overlaid with a white grid and a white, rectangular frame with markings that enhance the visual structure. A compass icon is in the lower-left corner, and labels for longitude and latitude display changing numerical values. A glowing, red dashed line extends from the bow of the ship toward a small, glowing red dot. As the video progresses, a large, red dashed square forms, enclosing both the ship and the red dot.",
    "Motion": "A stylized white ship is depicted from a top-down view on a grid over a dark background, with a red dashed line connecting its bow to a small red dot. While the ship remains stationary, the longitude and latitude coordinates displayed on the screen steadily increase. A large, red dashed square is then drawn in a clockwise direction, starting from the left and progressively forming around the ship and the red dot until it is fully enclosed.",
    "Scene": "In a digital representation of a dark, rippling ocean at night, a white grid overlay provides coordinates, surrounded by a white, scaled rectangular frame at the edges of the video. A stylized white ship with an attached lifeboat is positioned in the lower right quadrant. A dashed red line extends from the ship's bow toward a glowing red dot in the upper left. Overlays display a compass icon in the bottom left corner, changing longitude values at the top center, and latitude values on the right side. As the video progresses, a red, dashed square is drawn onto the grid, eventually enclosing the red dot and the ship.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
