  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a light-skinned young adult man with short brown hair, positioned centrally in the middle ground, seated at a desk. He is wearing a white t-shirt underneath an unbuttoned red and black plaid flannel shirt and has a white watch on his left wrist. A black microphone on a stand is in the middle ground, in front of him and slightly to the viewer's left. His hands rest near a light-colored keyboard in the middle ground at the bottom center of the frame. He is in a black DXRacer gaming chair, also in the middle ground. To the left, a dark monitor is in the foreground, along with a small potted plant and a black rectangular object with \"SIMPLE\" printed on it visible on the desk in the middle ground. The background features a sloped ceiling at the top, with red light illuminating the left wall and blue light on the right wall where a circular fan is mounted. The structure beside the sloped ceiling section resembles a vent, giving the appearance of a dark void. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the midground in focus while the background is blurred. The camera remains static throughout the shot. The man is speaking into the microphone while occasionally moving his hand, which is resting on the keyboard. The scene is set indoors in a room with white walls, which appear dark due to dim lighting. The camera provides an objective POV shot, capturing the scene from a detached, observational perspective.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a room with white walls, which appear dark due to dim lighting, and a sloped ceiling section. A person is seated in a black DXRacer gaming chair at a dark desk. A black cylindrical microphone on a boom arm is positioned in front of him. On the desk, a light-colored keyboard, a small potted plant, and a black rectangular object with \"SIMPLE\" printed on it are visible next to a dark monitor on the left. The background is illuminated by red light on the left wall and blue light on the right wall, where a circular fan is mounted.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
