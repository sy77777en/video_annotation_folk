  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of an aged hand in the foreground, positioned in the bottom left of the frame, gently moving away from the lower half of an ornate wine glass, disappearing to the left. The camera is static at hip level, maintaining a level angle with an extremely shallow depth of field. As the hand exits the frame, the focus shifts along a row of wine glasses extending from the foreground to the background, positioned centrally and slightly to the right, reflecting soft light and creating a warm ambiance. The camera executes a rack focus to shift attention to the background, where a person, likely a waiter, is visible on the left side, crouching down to inspect the alignment of the glasses. He is dressed in a formal outfit, including an old-fashioned white powdered wig and a colorful striped uniform, suggesting a professional setting. His posture indicates attentiveness as he ensures the glasses are perfectly organized, with most of his body visible in the frame. The scene captures the elegance of the table setting, with the wine glasses reflecting soft light. The video showcases an elegant dining setting with a long, ornate table adorned with shimmering silverware and delicate glassware, reflecting warm, ambient light. A row of neatly arranged wine glasses and a line of elegant red chairs add to the opulent atmosphere. The soft bokeh effect from the background lights adds a dreamy quality, suggesting an evening setting. Notable visual elements include the polished silver, which gleams against the muted tones of the tablecloth, and the elegant glassware with subtle curves and intricate designs. The overall composition conveys a sense of opulence and refinement, with the camera capturing the scene from a detached, observational perspective.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
