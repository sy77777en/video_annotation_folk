  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, with no single subject as the focus. The majority of the frame is dominated by a massive cloud bank, extending from the middle ground to the background. A dry strip extends into the distance across the bottom of the frame, with the flat desert plain stretching from the foreground to the background. On the far left horizon, a faint mountain range sits in the background. In the background, above the horizon and between the plains at the bottom and the massive cloud bank, there is a pale sky. Throughout the time-lapse, the clouds churn and expand across the frame, with a prominent dark section on the right growing larger. A shaft of rain is visible falling in the background on the right. The lower, central part of the cloud base shows significant swirling motion, appearing to descend closer to the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low, stationary height, emphasizing the immense scale of the storm system. The time-lapse captures the vastness of the sky from a camera angle positioned between eye level and overhead. The deep focus technique ensures both the foreground landscape and the dramatic clouds remain in sharp detail. Throughout the shot, the camera executes a smooth, subtle pan from left to right, following the movement of the storm clouds. The sky is filled with massive, dark gray and black clouds that swirl and churn, with some brighter white clouds and a patch of blue sky visible above. Below the turbulent cloud base, a distinct shaft of heavy rain falls in the distance. The foreground consists of a flat, brown plain with sparse, dry vegetation, and a low mountain range is visible on the far horizon.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a single subject. A vast, turbulent mass of dark, brooding storm clouds dominates the sky, churning ominously over a wide, arid desert plain. The clouds are a deep grey, almost black in the densest areas, while a curtain of heavy rain is visible falling in the distance. The flat, brownish-yellow landscape below is sparsely covered with scrub brush and extends towards a faint mountain range on the horizon, creating a powerful sense of natural drama and scale.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot. The video features a time-lapse of dramatic, dark storm clouds. These clouds churn and swirl across the sky, with a visible rain shaft moving across the distant landscape.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video shows a dramatic storm system moving across a vast, arid landscape.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
