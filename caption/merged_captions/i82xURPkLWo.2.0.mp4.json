  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in a dark denim jacket over a black shirt stands in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, with a buzz cut and a trimmed beard. He appears engaged in a conversation, as his facial expression changes slightly throughout the video. In the right foreground, the back of a second man in a dark leather jacket is initially visible as he is bent over. This man, with curly hair, then stands up, his back and head occupying the right side of the frame, creating an over-the-shoulder perspective that keeps the focus on the first man. The setting includes a large, abstract mural positioned in the background behind them, featuring flowing shapes in shades of red and orange against a dark, textured background, with parts of the surface appearing worn or peeled away. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. It smoothly moves upward before tilting downward, remaining at the subjects' level throughout the shot. Initially, the man in the denim jacket looks down, then continues to look at the second man, who subtly raises his hand, likely to gesture or emphasize a point during their interaction. The two men are facing each other, suggesting an interaction or dialogue between them. The camera captures this scene of two men talking, with the colorful, abstract painting providing a vibrant backdrop.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man as the main subject, who is wearing a dark denim jacket over a black shirt. He has a buzz cut and a trimmed beard. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expression changes slightly throughout the video. A secondary subject, another man, becomes visible when he stands up.

    "Motion": "A man in a denim jacket stands in front of a colorful, abstract painting, initially looking down. Another man, wearing a leather jacket, stands up and faces the first man. The first man continues to look at the second man, who subtly raises his hand, likely to gesture or emphasize a point during their interaction.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV, the scene is set indoors, with two men standing before a large, distressed wall mural. The camera is positioned behind one man in a black jacket, looking toward the other. The mural behind them features abstract, flowing shapes in shades of red and orange against a dark, textured background, with parts of the surface appearing worn or peeled away.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
