  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot of an urban streetscape with no main subjects. Initially, a low stone wall with a transparent glass barrier, appearing frosted due to water vapor, extends from the left to the right of the frame. In the middle ground to the right, a building with a green, graffiti-covered facade is visible, set against a clear blue sky in the background. The camera, positioned at eye level, pans to the right with noticeable barrel distortion and slight unsteadiness, navigating around a pedestrian barrier before continuing straight along the sidewalk. This movement shifts the stone wall out of the frame from the left, bringing the green facade to the left-middle position. An adjacent building with a large, curtained window becomes prominent in the middle ground on the right, while a sidewalk extends from the right foreground to the left-middle ground. The building with the green facade is adorned with various posters and blue and pink graffiti, while the adjacent building entrance features a large glass window and door, partially covered by light-colored curtains from the inside, with small signs visible on the window pane. A dark drainpipe runs vertically down the building wall between these two sections. The sky is initially visible at the top of the frame and shifts to the upper left by the end of the video. The shot establishes a gritty, city environment, focusing on the urban atmosphere and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp, emphasizing the textures and overall scene.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot is characterized by noticeable barrel distortion. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp. The camera moves forward with slight unsteadiness, initially panning right to navigate around a pedestrian barrier before continuing straight along the sidewalk.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific main subject. It presents a street-level view featuring a modern transparent glass barrier that appears blurred atop a dark stone wall, juxtaposed with older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door adorned with posters, while the adjacent one features a large window covered by light curtains and displaying small signs. The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of an urban street. The camera pans to the right, revealing a building facade with graffiti, posters, and a storefront. The shot establishes a gritty, city environment.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. The video pans slightly right along a sidewalk paved with small square tiles. In the immediate foreground is a low, straight wall made of dark grey stone blocks, surmounted by a transparent glass barrier with a frosted appearance due to water vapor. To the right of this structure are buildings lining the sidewalk. One building presents a light green, boarded-up facade adorned with various posters and blue and pink graffiti. Adjacent to it is another building entrance featuring a large glass window and door, partially covered by light-colored curtains from the inside, with small signs visible on the window pane. A dark drainpipe runs vertically down the building wall between these two sections. The sky is initially visible at the top of the frame and shifts to the upper left by the end of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
