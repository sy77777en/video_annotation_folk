  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a woman with fair skin, reddish-brown hair, and light-colored eyes in the center of the screen, positioned in the foreground against a blurred, blue-toned background. Her expression is neutral, and her forehead is partially visible. The camera is at eye level with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman. She looks straight ahead before her eyes shift to the bottom left of the frame. The camera then performs a smooth dolly zoom, simultaneously moving backward and zooming in, which keeps the woman's face at a consistent size while the background appears to compress. During this camera movement, the woman raises her hands from the bottom of the frame and places them on the left and right sides of her neck. Eventually, her hands leave her neck. The out-of-focus environment appears as a solid, gray-blue surface, creating a minimalist setting under soft, diffused lighting. The camera comes to a stop, holding a dynamic close-up that effectively captures her continued motion, with the camera remaining at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the foreground. The camera performs a smooth dolly zoom, moving slightly backward while zooming in on her face. It then comes to a stop, holding a dynamic close-up that effectively captures her continued motion.",
    "Subject": "A woman with fair skin, reddish-brown hair, and light-colored eyes is shown in a close-up, looking directly forward. Her expression is neutral. Her forehead is partially visible, and her eyes initially look straight ahead before shifting to the bottom left of the frame. She then places her hands on the sides of her neck.",
    "Motion": "A woman looks straight ahead before her eyes shift to the bottom left of the frame. She raises her hands and places them on the sides of her neck. Eventually, her hands leave her neck.",
    "Scene": "In a close-up shot, a woman with red hair is set against a blurred, blue-toned background. The out-of-focus environment appears as a solid, gray-blue surface, creating a minimalist setting under soft, diffused lighting. During the shot, the woman places her hands on either side of her neck before moving them away. The camera slightly pulls back as it zooms in throughout the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
