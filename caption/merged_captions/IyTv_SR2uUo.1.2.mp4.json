  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a motorcycle rider in a blue, white, and red \"Avintia\" branded racing suit is positioned in the center-right foreground, with the white front of their Ducati motorcycle occupying the bottom right of the frame. The rider wears a black full-face helmet with red and white graphics and a sticker with the text \"@hectorbarbera\" on top. Their gloves are white, red, and blue, with the word \"VICTOR\" visible in red on the right glove. To their right, another rider in a black \"MACNA\" racing suit on a black and turquoise motorcycle with \"idda\" and \"e-motion\" branding is initially positioned in the top-left middle ground. The camera, fixed at the main subject's level, captures the forward motion along the track, with background elements like a large black inflatable arch with white and green branding and spectators on the left remaining in the distant background, appearing to recede as the riders advance. The video features a fixed point-of-view (POV) shot captured from a shaky, hip-level perspective with a fixed Dutch angle. The camera leads the subject from the front while moving backward, exhibiting noticeable shaking. The footage shows mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field. Initially, the rider on the white motorcycle is positioned alongside the rider on the black and blue motorcycle. The rider on the black motorcycle then accelerates forward, overtaking the rider on the white motorcycle as they navigate a turn and proceed down a straightaway, eventually passing under the large arch. The scene is set on a paved asphalt track under a bright, sunny sky with scattered white clouds, bordered by green grass and trees, as the landscape rushes by.",

    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a motorcycle captures a high-speed race on a paved asphalt track under a bright, sunny sky with scattered white clouds. The dark gray track is bordered by green grass, trees, and distant spectators. Another motorcycle, colored black and blue with white lettering, races alongside. The camera's perspective remains fixed as it speeds down a straightaway, approaching a large black inflatable arch with white and green branding. The white front of the motorcycle with red lettering and the rider's blue, white, and red racing suit are prominent in the foreground as the landscape rushes by.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a motorcycle rider in a blue and white suit is positioned in the center-right foreground, with the white front of their motorcycle occupying the bottom right of the frame. To their right, another rider on a black and blue motorcycle is initially positioned in the top-left middle ground before moving further left and out of the frame. The camera, fixed at the main subject's level, captures the forward motion along the track, with background elements like a large black arch and spectators on the left remaining in the distant background, appearing to recede as the riders advance."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
