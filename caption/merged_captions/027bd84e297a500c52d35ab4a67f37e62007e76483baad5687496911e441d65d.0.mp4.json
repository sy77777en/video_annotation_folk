  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a vertical line of five Russian nesting dolls is positioned in the center of the frame, arranged by increasing size from the foreground at the bottom towards the middle ground. The dolls, painted with intricate designs in shades of blue and red, feature serene expressions and traditional clothing. The wooden dolls are predominantly blue and white with orange and black details. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the level of the dolls, maintaining a static, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The dolls in the foreground are in focus, while those further back are less sharp. A hand with a light skin tone enters the frame from the right side and moves into the foreground, positioning itself to the side of the smallest doll. The hand makes a flicking gesture, and its index finger strikes the smallest doll at the front of the line, knocking it sideways to the left and out of the frame. The camera remains focused on the Matryoshka dolls at the front of the line, leaving those at the back and the hand in the foreground blurred. The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor environment with a plain, light-colored background, adding a playful interaction with the dolls.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The camera remains focused on the Matryoshka dolls at the front of the line, leaving those at the back and the hand in the foreground blurred.",
    "Subject": "The video features a series of nested Russian dolls, each progressively smaller and painted with intricate designs. The dolls are aligned in a straight line, with the largest at the back and the smallest at the front. Each doll has a similar design, featuring a face with a serene expression and traditional clothing in shades of blue and red. A hand with light skin tone enters the scene and gently flicks the smallest doll out of the frame, adding a playful interaction with the dolls.",
    "Motion": "A hand enters the frame from the right side and moves toward a line of stationary Russian nesting dolls. The hand makes a flicking gesture, and its index finger strikes the smallest doll at the front of the line, knocking it sideways to the left and out of the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit indoor setting with a plain, light-colored background, a line of five Russian nesting dolls is arranged in order of ascending size. The wooden dolls are painted with a predominantly blue and white color scheme, featuring orange and black details and simple faces. A hand, in focus in the foreground, flicks the smallest doll out of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
