  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot centered on a woman in a metallic gold spaghetti strap top with a V-neckline, who occupies the center foreground. She has brown skin, long, straight, slicked-back black hair, large gold multi-loop earrings, and a tattoo on her left shoulder. The camera is initially stationary on her before zooming out and panning left to frame both her and the interviewer. The interviewer, positioned on the right, has lighter skin and long brown hair styled in a high ponytail. She wears a beige dress with intricate, sheer, lacy detailing around the neckline and shoulders, along with long, dangling silver earrings. She holds a black microphone with a white and gold \"ET CANADA\" logo toward the first woman, who speaks into it while looking at the interviewer. The interviewer listens, turning her head slightly. In the final framing, the two women are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. A man in a suit stands in the middle ground behind the woman in the beige dress, while other people and red-and-white circular decorations are visible in the background. The setting is a crowded nighttime event on a vibrant red carpet within a large, white tent-like structure, with stylized red-and-white circular patterns hanging in the background. Further back, a sparkly wall is visible, and numerous people are seen mingling, including a bald man with a short beard in a dark suit and tie, and a man wearing a black beanie hat. An \"ET CANADA\" logo overlay is fixed in the bottom left corner. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, filmed from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, using a deep focus that keeps the subjects and background relatively sharp.",

    "Motion": "An interviewer in a beige dress holds a microphone towards a woman in a gold top, who speaks into it while looking at the interviewer. The interviewer listens, turning her head slightly. In the background, other attendees on the red carpet stand and move around slowly.",
    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at a crowded nighttime event on a vibrant red carpet. The setting is within a large, white tent-like structure, with stylized red-and-white circular patterns hanging in the background. Further back, a sparkly wall is visible, and numerous people are seen mingling. In the foreground, an interview is in progress, with one woman holding a black microphone featuring a yellow and white logo cube towards another. An overlay is present in the bottom left corner, featuring a yellow square with the white letters 'ET' and the word 'CANADA' below it.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot centered on a woman in a gold top, who occupies the center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
