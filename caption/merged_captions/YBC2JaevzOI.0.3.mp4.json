  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a young man with brown skin and short, dark, curly hair, centered in the frame, running toward the camera along a paved asphalt path marked with a single yellow line. The path extends from the bottom-center foreground to the right-center in the background, winding through a dense forest flanked by lush green foliage, ferns, and numerous tall, thin-trunked trees. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled light and distinct shadows across the path. The man is wearing a light-colored, patterned, long-sleeved hooded jacket over black shorts, with black socks and black and white running shoes. The eye-level shot begins with a stationary camera before smoothly panning left to track the runner as he approaches. As he runs closer, the framing transitions to a full shot, consistently keeping him centered. There is a slight camera shake immediately before and after the panning. The video maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. As the runner gets closer and larger in the frame, he slows to a stop, moves to the left foreground, and steps onto a low ledge next to a wooden bench. He bends over to adjust his right shoe. At this point, the path is positioned in the lower right of the frame, with the forest filling the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",

    "Scene": "A paved asphalt path, marked with a single yellow line, winds through a dense forest. The trail is flanked on both sides by lush green foliage, ferns, and numerous tall, thin-trunked trees. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled light and distinct shadows across the path. A person wearing a light-colored hooded jacket and dark shorts jogs along the path before pausing near a wooden bench to adjust their shoe.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
