  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a highway scene, capturing an expansive view of the road and its surroundings. The camera, likely mounted on a moving vehicle, provides a steady perspective of the road stretching into the distance. The road occupies the central portion of the frame, with white lane markings clearly visible. Trees line both sides of the road, positioned in the left and right areas of the frame, forming a natural corridor in the middle ground and background. The sky, showing hints of sunset, is located at the top of the frame, contributing to the overall ambiance. Vehicles appear intermittently, moving through the scene from various directions; they enter and exit the frame, altering the dynamic slightly but maintaining the focus on the road and its environment. The camera's movement with the vehicle emphasizes the continuity and flow of the highway, ensuring a stable and continuous view of the scene. The video is in time-lapse speed, with the camera positioned at hip level and angled straight ahead. It features deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward quickly along the road and trucks right as it changes lanes, maintaining smooth and steady motion. As the car moves forward, it passes several vehicles, including a black car, a red car, and a white truck. The highway is lined with guardrails and trees, and the sky shows a beautiful gradient from light to dark as the sun sets. The car continues to drive smoothly, passing under a bridge and overtaking other vehicles. The journey is marked by the changing light and the movement of other cars on the road, with the changing light subtly indicating the passage of time.",

    "Camera": "The video is in time-lapse speed, with the camera positioned at hip level and angled straight ahead. It features deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward quickly along the road and trucks right as it changes lanes, maintaining smooth and steady motion.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the open road and surrounding nature rather than a specific object. The wide view and perspective highlight the scale and expanse of the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a car driving on a highway surrounded by trees and greenery. As the car moves forward, it passes several vehicles, including a black car, a red car, and a white truck. The highway is lined with guardrails and trees, and the sky shows a beautiful gradient from light to dark as the sun sets. The car continues to drive smoothly, passing under a bridge and overtaking other vehicles. The journey is marked by the changing light and the movement of other cars on the road.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows a highway scene during the early evening. The road stretches ahead, flanked by dense trees on both sides, creating a natural corridor. The sky is clear with a hint of sunset on the horizon, casting a soft glow. Multiple vehicles, including a red car, are visible on the road, with some moving in the same direction as the camera and others traveling in the opposite direction on the other side of the guardrail. The asphalt is smooth and dark, with white lane markings. The scene conveys a sense of motion and transition as the vehicle progresses along the highway, with the changing light subtly indicating the passage of time.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
