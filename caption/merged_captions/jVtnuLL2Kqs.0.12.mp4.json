  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot that begins as an extreme wide shot and transitions to a wide shot as the camera moves forward. The video captures a dynamic scene of the Horse Guards building and its parade ground in London during the day. The large, symmetrical building, constructed from light-colored stone, features a central clock tower, with the London Eye visible in the distance to the center-left. The courtyard, covered in light brown sand, spans both the foreground and middle ground, bordered by simple posts situated entirely in the middle ground. Two dark equestrian statues stand on either side of the building's central section. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and an overlay of a white, stylized watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner. The Horse Guards building is positioned centrally in the background, with a large, sandy parade ground occupying the entire foreground and middle ground. A line of posts extends across the middle ground, with two equestrian statues in the background, flanking the building's central entrance. The London Eye is visible in the background to the center-left, while the sky fills the top of the frame. A watermark is overlaid in the bottom-right of the screen. As the camera, positioned at a straight-on height, advances, the building in the background grows larger within the frame. This time-lapse video, shot from a level, eye-level perspective, uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera dollies forward smoothly and quickly toward the large building in the center of the frame. The composition focuses on the impressive scale and historical atmosphere of the architectural environment, with the moving perspective emphasizing the building's grandeur and its place within the larger setting.",

    "Subject": "This video begins with an extreme wide shot of a grand, classical-style building, featuring a prominent central clock tower. The camera moves forward, transitioning to a wide shot that captures the symmetrical, light-stone structure from across a vast, empty, sandy courtyard under a partly cloudy sky. The composition focuses on the impressive scale and historical atmosphere of the architectural environment, with the moving perspective emphasizing the building's grandeur and its place within the larger setting.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an extreme wide-angle shot of a grand, classical building with a clock tower, likely the Horse Guards in London. The camera moves forward, transitioning to a wide shot, capturing the architecture and the vast, sandy parade ground in front of it under a partly cloudy sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
