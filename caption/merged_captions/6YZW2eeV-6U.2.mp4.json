  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of two men descending a staircase, occupying either side of the bottom of the frame. The man on the left wears an orange shirt and a blue backpack, while the man on the right is dressed in a blue and white jacket. The camera is positioned above them, capturing the rough, textured stone walls on either side, which are in the middle ground. The environment is outdoors initially, with natural light illuminating the scene, suggesting it is likely midday. The concrete walls are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of moss, indicating age and exposure to the elements. As the men move downwards, the camera follows, transitioning to their level, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking. The men are initially in the bottom center of the frame, with the staircase leading to a large, metallic door in the background. As they approach the door, the camera maintains a medium shot, with the men now positioned more centrally. The setting shifts to an interior space with a large, metallic door at the bottom, featuring geometric patterns and red star markings. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the enclosed, bunker-like atmosphere. The door becomes the focal point in the background. The camera's height adjusts to match the men's level as they reach the door, emphasizing the transition from an outdoor to an indoor setting. The men reach the bottom of the stairs and stand in front of the door, examining it closely. The man in the orange shirt turns his head to look back, while the other man remains facing the door.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward and downward, focusing on the two men as they descend the stairs. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two men descending a staircase in an ancient architectural setting. The man on the left wears an orange shirt and a blue backpack, while the man on the right is dressed in a blue and white jacket. Initially seen from behind, they approach a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The setting emphasizes the stone walls and the architectural details surrounding the men as they move towards the door.",
    "Motion": "Two men, one in an orange shirt with a blue backpack and the other in a blue and white jacket, are seen descending a stone staircase. They continue to walk down the stairs, approaching a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The men reach the bottom of the stairs and stand in front of the door, examining it closely. The man in the orange shirt turns his head to look back, while the other man remains facing the door.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into an underground setting. The environment is outdoors initially. The scene begins with a view of a concrete staircase flanked by rough, textured stone walls leading downwards. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The concrete walls are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of moss, indicating age and exposure to the elements. As the descent continues, the setting shifts to an interior space with a large, metallic door at the bottom, featuring geometric patterns and red star markings. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the enclosed, bunker-like atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a sense of exploration into a hidden or restricted area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
