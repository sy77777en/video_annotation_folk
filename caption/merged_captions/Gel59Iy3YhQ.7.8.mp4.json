  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young woman with light brown skin, short, dark, messy hair, and large, dark eyes, positioned in the center of the frame. She wears a white, sleeveless, pinstriped top, a blue cowl with visible stitching draped over her right shoulder, and a dark armband on her left bicep. Around her neck is a necklace with a teardrop-shaped pendant that emits a bright blue glow, appearing segmented due to its attachment to the string. The glowing blue necklace serves as the central focal point. From a ground-level perspective, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the shining rock necklace in the foreground. The camera executes a very smooth, slight zoom-in on the necklace before tilting upward to reveal the girl's face, shifting the view to a low angle. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning into a close-up that shifts the focus to her face. Her expression is serious and focused as she looks slightly upward. In the final composition, her face is framed in the center-right, while the top of her glowing staff occupies the foreground on the left. The young woman stays mostly still throughout the video, but she raises her right arm to lift the wooden staff, which is gnarled and dark with a light-colored cloth wrapping around its handle, and the top of which also glows blue. Near the end of the video, her head turns slightly to the right and her eyes move around. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this movement, holding this stationary shot for the remainder of the clip. The dimly lit, dark setting is illuminated by the blue light from the necklace and staff.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit, dark setting, a young character is illuminated by a blue light. The glow emanates from a cleverly tied single-stone pendant on a necklace, creating the illusion of a three-stoned pendant, and from the top of a gnarled, dark wooden staff she holds. The character wears a white, pinstriped tank top and a blue scarf with visible stitching around her neck and shoulders. The staff has a light-colored cloth wrapping around its handle. The character has dark hair and looks slightly upward as the view shifts from the necklace to her face.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
