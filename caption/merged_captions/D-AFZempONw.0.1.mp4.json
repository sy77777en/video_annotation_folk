  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot centered on a large apparatus with gray, ribbed tubes attached to a figure's back, which occupies the center and right of the frame. The camera, from a level angle slightly looking upward, focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The camera performs a smooth, minor backward movement, transitioning to a medium close-up shot. This movement reveals a slender man with pale, mottled skin wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, including a white section around his open mouth and eyes. He is restrained by a shackle around his chest and upper back. The man is in the center-left foreground, with his head angled toward the left of the frame and tilted upward, twitching slightly. As the camera moves, the tubes, which extend from the apparatus over his shoulders and head, begin to glow green, occupying the center and top portions of the frame. A hunched-over figure tenses and strains as numerous tubes connected from a large device on his back to the top of his head and both shoulders begin to glow with a vibrant green light. The glow appears to travel up the length of the tubes, and the figure's head jerks slightly as both his mouth and eyes remain open. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space with a reddish-pink glow, where the metal surfaces of the apparatus, along with an attached mask and a shackle running across the chest and upper back, display a weathered texture, reflecting the ambient green and pink lighting. Additionally, in the top right, more tubes are visible, pulsing with a pink light.",

    "Subject": "A slender man with pale, mottled skin is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, including a white section around his open mouth and eyes. He is restrained by a shackle around his chest and upper back. A large apparatus is attached to his back, from which numerous thick, ribbed tubes extend. These tubes initially appear gray, transition to a glowing neon green, and then revert back to gray, with an additional connection in the middle. Four tubes converge at the top of his head, and one tube extends from each shoulder. His arms are covered near the elbows with large black devices.",
    "Motion": "A hunched-over figure tenses and strains as numerous tubes connected from a large device on his back to the top of his head and both shoulders begin to glow with a vibrant green light. The glow appears to travel up the length of the tubes, and the figure's head jerks slightly as both his mouth and eyes remain open.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor space, bathed in a reddish-pink glow, an individual stands out, carrying a large, complex dark apparatus on his back. This apparatus is characterized by a cluster of thick, ribbed tubes that extend from it, attaching to the man's head and shoulders. Initially dark gray, these tubes begin to pulse with a bright, neon-green light. The metal surfaces of the apparatus, along with an attached mask and a shackle running across the chest and upper back, display a weathered texture, reflecting the ambient green and pink lighting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
