  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man with dark, curly, afro-style hair and a mustache, positioned in the center foreground, wearing a red, textured, long-sleeved shirt and a silver necklace with a small, teardrop-shaped pendant. The camera is at eye level, looking down from a high angle with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling, creating a slightly unsteady frame with some shaking. The man, with a light brown skin tone, is shown with his mouth open, as if singing or speaking animatedly, and his right hand extended forward towards the camera in a sweeping motion from left to right, while his left hand rests on his stomach. He slightly closes his eyes and furrows his brows, suggesting expressive energy. The background features a dimly lit room with a distinct green and orange glow, a black-and-white checkerboard pattern on the wall and floor, and various electronic equipment, including a television displaying static and an orange light tube, situated in the right background. In the left background, out-of-focus mannequin heads with dark hair are visible on a shelf. The camera performs clockwise rolling with intermittent pauses, and the video has significant motion blur but appears to have shallow focus on the person in the foreground. The overall atmosphere is dark and somewhat retro, with the man remaining relatively central, gesturing animatedly within the slightly shaky frame.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, looking down from a high angle with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The video has significant motion blur, but appears to have shallow focus on the person in the foreground.

    "Subject": "A man with dark, curly, afro-style hair and a mustache is the central figure. He has a light brown skin tone and is wearing a red, textured, long-sleeved shirt and a silver necklace with a small, teardrop-shaped pendant. He is shown with his mouth open, as if singing or speaking animatedly. His right hand is extended forward, palm out, in a gesturing motion, while his left hand rests on his stomach. In the background, at least two mannequin heads are faintly visible, though out of focus and lacking clear detail. Both are positioned to the left of the main subject and appear to have dark hair.",
    "Motion": "The man is in a room with a checkered black and white floor and walls, and various electronic equipment, including a TV and a jukebox, is visible in the background. He moves his right hand in a sweeping motion from left to right while keeping his left hand on his stomach. The man continues to move his right hand, slightly closes his eyes, and furrows his brows, suggesting he is speaking or singing, as indicated by his open mouth. The background remains consistent with the checkered pattern and the electronic equipment. The man’s movements are fluid, and he seems to be expressing himself energetically.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with a distinct green and orange glow. The background features a wall with a black-and-white checkerboard pattern, and a similar pattern is visible on the floor. Various pieces of electronic equipment are present, including a television displaying static. A separate orange light tube adds to the ambiance. A person wearing a textured red sweater and a silver necklace stands in the foreground. On a shelf in the left background, there are some fake human heads. The overall atmosphere is dark and somewhat retro.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground, with the camera at his level, though the frame is tilted, creating a Dutch angle. His right hand is extended forward towards the camera, while his left hand is on his stomach. In the left background, out-of-focus mannequin heads are visible. A checkerboard pattern is present on the wall in the background and on the floor at the bottom of the frame. Electronic equipment, including a television displaying static and an orange light tube, is situated in the right background. The man remains relatively central, gesturing animatedly within the slightly shaky frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
