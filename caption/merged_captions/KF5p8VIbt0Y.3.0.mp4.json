  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot of a black and white video, a young man wearing dark overalls and with sparse black hair stands in the bottom center foreground, making slight movements. Directly behind him, a two-story wooden house occupies the center and upper portions of the frame in the middle ground. The house features a gabled roof, with the upper level covered in clapboard siding and the lower level adorned with scalloped shingles and a decorative trellis pattern. The entire front facade of the house suddenly detaches and falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. As the facade collapses, it breaks apart upon hitting the ground. The man remains stationary in the bottom center of the frame, perfectly framed within the open window space of the fallen wall. The now-exposed interior of the house, visible in the middle ground behind him, is a pile of rubble and debris. The camera maintains a static shot from an eye-level, level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the man in the foreground to the house behind him, sharp and clear.",

    "Camera": "This is a static shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the man in the foreground to the house behind him, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "In a black and white video, a young man wearing dark overalls and with sparse black hair makes slight movements in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade of the house, featuring scalloped shingles on the lower half and a window, detaches and falls forward. The man does not move significantly as the wall crashes to the ground around him, leaving him standing perfectly in the open space previously occupied by the window. Behind him, the now-exposed interior of the house is a pile of rubble and debris.",
    "Motion": "A man stands while making slight movements in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade of the house detaches and falls forward, crashing to the ground around him. The man does not move and is left standing perfectly framed within the open window space of the fallen wall.",
    "Scene": "In a monochromatic outdoor setting, a two-story wooden house with a gabled roof stands in a yard next to another building. The upper level of the house is covered in clapboard siding, while the lower level features scalloped shingles and a decorative trellis pattern. The entire front facade of the house suddenly detaches and collapses forward, breaking apart as it hits the ground. The event leaves the interior of the house exposed, with a man standing safely within the open frame where a window once was.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a man stands in the bottom center foreground. Directly behind him, a two-story wooden house occupies the center and upper portions of the frame in the middle ground. The entire front facade of the house detaches and falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. The man remains stationary in the bottom center of the frame as the wall crashes to the ground around him, with the open window frame landing perfectly around his position. The now-exposed interior of the house is visible in the middle ground behind him. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
