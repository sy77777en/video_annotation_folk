  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a light blue and dark blue KLM airplane, with \"KLM\" visible in white on the side of its nose, initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a grey concrete runway. The aircraft has four jet engines, two under each wing, and its landing gear is deployed. The fuselage is blue, while the wings and tail are white, and the lower part of the aircraft is dark blue with a white line running through the middle, slightly above the wings. The runway, featuring stationary white painted lines, extends from the foreground into the background, with white markings visible on the surface. A plain dark grey expanse forms the background, suggesting an overcast sky or a simplified, non-detailed environment. The overall visual style is characterized by a muted color palette of blues, whites, and greys. As the airplane, initially stationary, begins to move forward, it accelerates down the runway towards the viewer, remaining centrally framed and appearing smaller. The camera angle is initially level, then changes to a high angle as it smoothly moves backward, craning upward around the airplane. The camera leads the airplane from the front, and the airplane becomes smaller in the frame during this tracking shot. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is very smooth with no shaking. The camera, initially at the airplane's level, gradually elevates and tilts slightly downwards, transitioning to a position above the subject. The runway markings in the foreground and background pass beneath and alongside the airplane, enhancing the sense of motion and depth.",

    "Motion": "A light blue and dark blue KLM airplane, initially stationary on a grey concrete runway with its landing gear deployed, begins to move forward, accelerating as it travels down the runway towards the viewer.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a grey airport runway, where a large airplane, painted in blue and white with \"KLM\" markings, is moving forward. The runway surface, made of concrete or asphalt, features stationary white painted lines. Four jet engines are visible beneath the wings of the plane, and its landing gear is down. The backdrop is a plain, dark grey expanse, suggesting an overcast sky or a simplified, non-detailed environment. The overall visual style is characterized by a muted color palette of blues, whites, and greys.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of a KLM airplane, initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, on a grey runway. The runway, featuring white painted lines, extends from the foreground into the background. A plain dark grey expanse forms the background. As the airplane begins to move forward along the runway, it remains centrally framed and appears smaller. The camera, initially at the airplane's level, gradually elevates and tilts slightly downwards, transitioning to a position above the subject. The runway markings in the foreground and background pass beneath and alongside the airplane."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
