  "merged_caption": "An overhead close-up shot shows an open white box positioned in the center of the frame on a white surface scattered with dark specks. A black rectangular smartwatch is in a recessed section on the left side of the box's grey molded insert. Initially, a light-skinned hand in the right foreground holds an orange utility knife with a textured grip and places it on the right side of the box. The same hand then picks up a second utility knife with a black, honeycomb-patterned handle from the right of the box and places it to the left of the orange one, with its blade extended and pointing toward the smartwatch. The black-handled knife bears the word \"Subscribe.\" Throughout the shot, colorful plastic sticks are visible in the top-left background, and a set of precision screwdrivers with metallic bodies and colored bands lies in the right background. The camera remains overhead, capturing the entire scene with clarity and detail, showcasing the watch in its box, the hand holding a knife, and the surrounding tools all in sharp focus.",

    "Subject": "A man's light-skinned hand initially holds a utility knife with a bright orange, textured handle and a silver blade holder. He then places this knife on an open white box containing a black, rectangular smartwatch nestled in a grey molded insert. Next, he picks up a second utility knife with a black, honeycomb-patterned handle from the right side of the box and positions it on the box to the left of the orange-handled knife. The black-handled knife has its blade extended and bears the word \"Subscribe.\" To the right of the box is a collection of precision screwdrivers with metallic bodies and colored bands. In the upper left, a bundle of colorful plastic sticks is visible. The white surface around the box is lightly scattered with small, dark metal shavings.",

    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective reveals a scene on a white surface scattered with dark specks. In the center lies an open white box containing a grey molded insert. This insert features two recessed sections: one holds a black rectangular smartwatch, and the other is being hovered over by a hand holding an orange utility knife with a textured grip. A second utility knife with a black, honeycomb-patterned handle rests nearby. The surrounding area includes a cluster of colorful rods to the left and an assortment of screwdrivers and a multi-tool to the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
