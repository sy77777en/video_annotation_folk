  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level and tilted, creating a Dutch angle. Initially, the primary motorcyclist, wearing a red, white, and blue racing suit and helmet, is in the center of the frame, appearing larger as they approach the camera, then becoming smaller as they move forward, eventually shifting to the bottom right of the frame. The road initially extends from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, spanning from the background to the foreground. As the camera pans right and tilts up and down, the Dutch angle changes, causing the road to extend from the bottom left corner to the bottom right corner, spanning from the foreground to the background. A concrete edge runs along the bottom left, also in the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a desert or barren landscape is visible, with undulating mountains and a clear sky occupying the upper half of the frame above the main diagonal running from the top left to the bottom right. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow playback. The camera is positioned at hip level, initially at a high angle looking down, and transitions to a level angle as it pans rightward, tilting upward and then slightly downward. The Dutch angle varies with the camera's motion. The camera uses deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field, and smoothly tracks the motorcyclist, panning rightward with a slight clockwise roll as they take a turn. Towards the end of the shot, a second motorcyclist enters the frame from the bottom right corner, positioned further in the distance compared to the first motorcyclist in the middle ground. The primary rider leans the motorcycle deeply into a turn, maintaining a low and aerodynamic position, with the motorcycle's front wheel close to the ground and the rider's body tightly pressed against the bike.",

    "Subject": "A person is riding a sport motorcycle. The rider wears a full-face helmet that is predominantly red and white with black accents, featuring a white number \"6\" on a blue circular background on its top and a clear visor. The rider is clad in a racing suit, primarily red, dark blue, and white, adorned with various logos and text, and matching gloves. The motorcycle is also red, dark blue, and white, with a number \"6\" on its front fairing. The rider is leaning sharply into a turn.",
    "Motion": "A motorcyclist, dressed in a red, white, and blue racing suit and helmet, is seen riding a red and white motorcycle with the number '6' on it, on a paved road in a desert-like environment with mountains in the background. The rider leans the motorcycle deeply into a turn, maintaining a low and aerodynamic position. The motorcycle's front wheel is close to the ground, and the rider's body is tightly pressed against the bike. The background remains consistent with a clear sky and barren landscape as the motorcycle continues to navigate the turn.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a motorcycle with a rider in red, white, and blue racing gear, marked with the number \"6,\" leaning sharply into a turn on a wide, sloped, paved surface. The setting is outdoors, in a desert-like environment with distant, hazy mountains visible under a clear, bright blue sky, suggesting a sunny day. The paved surface has a dark grey, smooth texture, with a lighter grey, slightly raised concrete edge on one side. Sparse tufts of grass can be seen on the distant sides of the road, enhancing the desert landscape. The motorcycle casts a distinct shadow on the pavement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
