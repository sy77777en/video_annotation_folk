  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor, white-tiled environment with pools. Initially, a small, dark green pool is positioned in the bottom right foreground, while a larger expanse of water stretches from the center-bottom middle ground into the background. A white tiled wall occupies the left foreground and middle ground. Bright, elongated lights are visible on the ceiling at the top of the frame and on distant walls in the background, reflecting on the water. Two large, white cylindrical pillars rise from the larger pool, with one prominent pillar in the center-right middle ground and another further in the background. The video begins with a view of a small pool of water on the right side of a tiled floor, with white walls and columns in the background. As the camera moves forward, the small pool gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the tiled floor and the expansive water surface. The camera maintains a deep focus throughout and then tilts upward, positioning the expansive water area at the center-bottom. The larger body of water appears to expand, occupying more of the lower half of the frame from the foreground to the deep background. The ceiling lights become more prominent due to the upward tilt, while the camera consistently maintains an eye-level perspective. The camera exhibits mild barrel distortion and is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking down, but it transitions to a level angle as the camera moves. This is a first-person POV shot where the camera moves forward, concluding with a slight upward tilt. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking. The focus is on the liminal, dreamlike quality of the environment itself, its scale, and the eerie ambiance created by the stark white surfaces, reflective water, and uniform bright lighting.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking down, but it transitions to a level angle as the camera moves. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. This is a first-person POV shot where the camera moves forward, concluding with a slight upward tilt. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "This video captures an interior architectural scene featuring a large, sterile, white-tiled room. In the foreground, a smaller pool of dark, rippling water is visible in the lower right corner, while a larger, more expansive pool stretches into the distance. Bright, even illumination from rows of fluorescent lights on the ceiling and walls casts shimmering reflections on the water's surface. Two massive white cylindrical pillars stand prominently in the distant pool, with one positioned in the front and the other further back. The camera slowly navigates this space, emphasizing its expansive and somewhat unsettling emptiness. The focus is on the liminal, dreamlike quality of the environment itself, its scale, and the eerie ambiance created by the stark white surfaces, reflective water, and uniform bright lighting.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a small pool of water on the right side of a tiled floor, with white walls and columns in the background. In the mid-ground, a more expansive body of water is visible. As the camera moves forward, the small pool gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the tiled floor and the expansive water surface. The camera maintains a deep focus throughout and then tilts upward, positioning the expansive water area at the center-bottom. The white columns and the illuminated background become the main focus as the video progresses.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates an expansive indoor space characterized by white tiled walls and floors. The room contains multiple pools of dark green, rippling water. As the camera moves forward, the smaller, rectangular pool initially visible in the foreground disappears from the bottom right corner of the frame. Meanwhile, the larger body of water extends from the center-bottom of the frame into the background, punctuated by several large, smooth white cylindrical columns. The bright, elongated white light fixtures mounted on the high ceiling reflect on the water's surface, illuminating the stark, minimalist environment. The two massive columns, the bright ceiling, and the surrounding walls align closely with the frame, enhancing the immersive experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
