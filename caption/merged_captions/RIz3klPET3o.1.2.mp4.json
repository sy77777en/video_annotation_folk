  "merged_caption": "In a side-view gaming video, a small, stylized figure resembling a person on a bicycle, depicted in black and white with minimal detail, starts slightly to the lower right of the center of the frame, rotating while descending. The bicycle is minimalistic, with thin lines forming the frame and wheels, and is accented with tiny red, green, and blue dots. The camera quickly and smoothly tracks the animated figure from the side, moving downward to follow its path. As the figure consistently descends, it interacts with several large polygons that repeatedly enter the scene from the bottom right, move diagonally up and to the left, and exit at the top left. These polygons are rendered as simple black outlines and appear intermittently against a solid gray, featureless background. As the figure makes contact with the geometric edges, it continues to rotate and maintain its motion in the center-right area of the frame. Throughout the scene, the camera follows the subject's movement, capturing the dynamic interaction between the figure and the polygons.",

    "Camera": "The camera quickly and smoothly tracks an animated figure from the side, moving downward to follow its path.",
    "Subject": "The video features a small, stylized figure resembling a person on a bicycle, depicted in black and white with minimal detail. Four colorful points follow the figure. The bicycle itself is minimalistic, with thin lines forming the frame and wheels.",
    "Motion": "A small, stylized figure on a bicycle consistently descends and interacts with several large polygons that move from the lower right to the upper left of the scene. As the figure makes contact with the geometric edges, it continues to rotate and maintain its motion in the center-right area of the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a small, complex black-and-white line-art figure moves against a solid gray, featureless background. The figure, which appears to be on a wheeled contraption, is accented with tiny red, green, and blue dots. Throughout the scene, a large, irregular polygon, rendered as a simple black outline, intermittently appears from the lower right corner, moves swiftly upward, and then disappears.",
    "Spatial": "In a side-view gaming video, a small, stylized figure on a bicycle starts slightly to the lower right of the center of the frame, rotating while descending. A large, black-outlined polygon repeatedly enters the scene from the bottom right, moves diagonally up and to the left, and exits at the top left. The camera follows the subject's movement throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
