  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a macaw's head is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, with its body largely hidden by a large green leaf. The bird is partially obscured by the leaf in the foreground, with one prominent leaf occupying the center-right and another with holes visible in the bottom-left. The background is filled with out-of-focus foliage, creating a dense, naturalistic environment. The macaw, with a predominantly bright red body and bright orange and red feathers on its head, has a patch of white, featherless skin around its light-colored eye. Its two-toned beak consists of a black lower mandible and a lighter, horn-colored upper mandible. Initially, the macaw's head is lowered as it eats from a small container, partially obscured by large, dark green leaves. The bird lifts its head slightly, bringing its eye and beak more clearly into view from behind the foreground leaf, while continuing to chew, repeatedly opening and closing its beak. The scene is dimly lit with a dark, blurred background, and the static camera, positioned at the macaw's level, focuses on the parrot in the midground, employing an extremely shallow depth of field.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the static camera focuses on a parrot in the midground, employing an extremely shallow depth of field.",

The bird has a patch of white, featherless skin around its light-colored eye. Its two-toned beak consists of a black lower mandible and a lighter, horn-colored upper mandible. The macaw is positioned behind the foliage, eating from a small container. One of the prominent green leaves in the foreground has several small, circular holes in it.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit setting with a dark, blurred background, a macaw with orange and red head feathers lifts its head from a feeding container. A patch of white skin surrounds its eye, and its two-toned beak, featuring a black lower mandible and a lighter, horn-colored upper mandible, is visible. The scene is filled with out-of-focus, dark green foliage, creating a dense, naturalistic environment.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a macaw's head is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, with its body largely hidden by a large green leaf. Only the head and the rightmost part of the body are visible. The bird is partially obscured by the leaf in the foreground, with one prominent leaf occupying the center-right and another with holes visible in the bottom-left. The background is filled with out-of-focus foliage. The macaw, initially with its head lowered, lifts its head slightly, bringing its eye and beak more clearly into view from behind the foreground leaf. The camera remains static and is positioned at the macaw's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
