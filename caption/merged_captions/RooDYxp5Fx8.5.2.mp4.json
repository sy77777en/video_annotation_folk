  "merged_caption": "The video captures a bustling urban street, showcasing the dynamic interaction between urban elements and natural surroundings. The scene is framed with modern buildings extending from the foreground to the middle ground on the left, while a curved silver building is positioned in the middle ground on the right. Vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses, move along the road, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, enhancing the sense of depth and continuity. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk on the left. A gray van is parked at the roadside in the foreground at the bottom right corner, disappearing from the frame as the camera moves. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves continuously forward along the street, slightly panning right to adjust orientation. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, suggesting a first-person perspective achieved through handheld cinematography, which adds a sense of immersion and realism to the scene. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and there are green hills visible in the background, enhancing the sense of openness. The street is busy with various types of traffic, including cars, buses, and vans. The video presents a first-person POV shot of a bustling urban street during the day. The scene is set outdoors, featuring a wide road lined with modern buildings on either side. On the left, a series of multi-story structures with a mix of orange and gray facades stand prominently. The presence of traffic signs and crosswalks indicates a well-organized urban environment. In the distance, green hills provide a natural backdrop, contrasting with the urban setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
