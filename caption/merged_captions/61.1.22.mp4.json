  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a large, light-colored hat and distinctive white, oversized sunglasses. He has long dreadlocks, a gray beard, and is dressed in a green jacket over a colorful, patterned shirt, accessorized with layered necklaces. Positioned around the center of the frame, his head and upper torso are visible in the foreground. The background includes vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like neon signs and hanging flags, contributing to a lively, festive indoor atmosphere. The camera, at eye level, moves backward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady movement, while maintaining a shallow depth of field. As the scene progresses, the man begins to turn his head to his right, maintaining a calm and composed expression, and his body follows the motion slightly, making it seem like a relaxed dance. He remains primarily in the left-center of the frame, with the background elements staying consistent, enhancing the celebratory vibe. The environment is dimly lit, with warm, ambient lighting from neon signs and colorful streamers hanging from the ceiling. The decor features various decorations on the walls, and the time of day is not explicitly clear due to the indoor lighting. The overall composition suggests a casual, social gathering space, with the man's neutral expression and relaxed demeanor adding to the eclectic and lively ambiance. The background includes a neon sign and another sign with text in a different language, as well as various hanging flags and lights, maintaining the festive indoor setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
