  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide shot of an expansive waterfall system, focusing on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, the frame is dominated by dozens of waterfalls cascading down a long, vegetation-covered cliff face that stretches across the more distant middle ground. The dark, reddish-brown rock of the cliff is interspersed with large vertical swathes of vibrant green vegetation, creating a striped pattern against the white, rushing water. A lush forest is positioned in the nearer middle ground at the bottom of the frame, with more forest and a river visible in the background along the top of the cliff. Filmed from a level angle, the camera slowly and smoothly pans left across a wide vista of the Iguazu Falls, revealing more of the waterfall system. This movement brings larger, more powerful sections of the falls into view on the left side of the frame, while the rightmost falls gradually exit the shot. The camera maintains a level-angle perspective, looking across at the falls from a distance. A deep focus keeps the entire lush, green landscape and the cascading water sharp and clear. The dense, lush green forest with various types of trees and foliage frames the scene from the middle ground and extends across the top of the cliff. The camera's slow pan from right to left showcases the immense scale of the natural wonder, emphasizing the overall environment and the collective power of the falls rather than a specific object or entity. The scene is set during the daytime, with a wide river feeding the cascades visible above the falls, completing the awe-inspiring beauty of this natural formation.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a panoramic landscape scenery shot of a massive waterfall system. The camera slowly pans left, revealing an expansive, long cliff face from which dozens of individual waterfalls cascade down. The dark, reddish-brown rock of the cliff is interspersed with large vertical swathes of vibrant green vegetation, creating a striped pattern against the white, rushing water. A dense, lush green forest with various types of trees and foliage frames the scene from the middle ground and extends across the top of the cliff. There is no main subject because the shot is designed to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring beauty of the natural formation itself, focusing on the overall environment and the collective power of the falls rather than a specific object or entity.",
    "Motion": "This scenic video captures a wide view of a massive waterfall system. The camera performs a slow pan from right to left, showcasing the numerous cascades of water tumbling over a long, rocky cliff covered in lush green vegetation. The entire landscape is framed by a dense, tropical forest.",
    "Scene": "A panoramic view of Iguazu Falls reveals a vast series of waterfalls cascading down a wide, rocky cliff face during the daytime. The dark, reddish-brown cliffs are extensively covered in vibrant green moss and vegetation, creating a striped pattern against the white, flowing water. A lush, dense jungle with various trees populates the middle ground and extends to the area above the falls, where a wide river can be seen feeding the cascades. The camera slowly pans from right to left, showcasing the immense scale of the natural wonder.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
