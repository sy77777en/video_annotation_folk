  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a bustling Japanese commercial street scene with a wide shot. In the middle ground, two women in traditional kimonos, one in red with white floral designs and the other in a darker shade with a similar pattern, stand slightly to the right near the shop entrance, centrally framed against the shop's exterior. To the left, a group of schoolchildren in uniforms, consisting of dark blazers and skirts or shorts, gathers closely, partially overlapping with the shop's entrance and engaging in conversation, which adds dynamic movement to the scene. In the foreground, two elderly individuals wearing masks walk past the camera from left to right, smoothly transitioning from the middle ground and briefly entering the frame. The shop's architecture, featuring a sloped roof with wooden accents and a modern glass storefront, forms the background, with colorful signage and promotional boards visible throughout, hinting at a vibrant, lively atmosphere. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward and to the left, slightly unsteady with some shaking, capturing the scene of people outside a shop. The time of day appears to be daytime, with clear visibility and no signs of adverse weather. Two individuals in traditional attire are standing outside, looking down at their phones. Meanwhile, a group of students in uniform gathers near the entrance, some entering the shop while others wait outside. The scene is calm, with people moving at a leisurely pace. The environment is lively, with people interacting and moving around the shop area, and a few decorative elements, such as hanging ornaments, add to the visual interest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
