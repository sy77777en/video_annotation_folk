  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the viewer’s hands and weapon consistently occupying the lower center and lower right foreground of the frame. The environment, visible in the middle ground and background, consists of stone or concrete barriers and low walls that stretch horizontally across the frame, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings further back, mostly in the upper and central background. The scene is illuminated by a green night vision effect, rendering all elements in shades of green. At the start, the right hand moves from the lower right foreground to throw a grenade toward the center middle ground, where an enemy figure becomes partially visible and is engulfed in bright green flames, positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at eye level, initially static, shakes as the player throws the grenade. Following this, the individual draws their firearm, equipped with a holographic sight and having a metallic, matte finish, and aims it forward. The firearm is then brought up to the lower center and right foreground, remaining steady and aligned with the viewer’s line of sight. The camera zooms in slightly when aiming and shakes again during weapon fire, enhancing the immersive experience. The subject’s hands and firearm become visible in the foreground after the grenade is thrown and remain visible throughout the rest of the sequence. Overlay elements include a heads-up display (HUD) with ammunition count and weapon icons in the lower right corner, and aiming parameters on the left side of the screen. A small text overlay with dialogue in red and white near the bottom center reads: \"AI-Qatala Fighter 3: Where is the lab?\" providing context to the scene. The spatial arrangement remains stable, with the main dynamic being the movement of the hand and weapon in the foreground and the appearance of flames and the enemy figure in the middle ground.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the first-person perspective of a player in an FPS game. The shot uses deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. Initially static, the camera shakes as the player throws a grenade, zooms in slightly when aiming, and shakes again during weapon fire. The movement is slightly unsteady, with noticeable shaking during action moments, enhancing the immersive experience.",
    "Subject": "The video provides a first-person perspective of an individual wearing tactical gloves, holding a firearm equipped with a holographic sight. The scene is illuminated by a green night vision effect, rendering all elements in shades of green. The sequence begins with the individual throwing a grenade with their right hand, igniting an enemy figure in front, who appears partially visible and engulfed in vivid, neon green flames. Following this, the individual draws their firearm and shoots. The firearm has a metallic, matte finish, and the person maintains a steady grip, with their hands and weapon consistently in the foreground. The night vision effect gives the subjects a distinct, high-contrast appearance.",
    "Motion": "The individual first throws a grenade with their right hand toward an enemy figure ahead. After the grenade detonates and the enemy is set on fire, the individual quickly draws their firearm, aims it forward, and fires shots while maintaining a steady grip on the weapon. The subject’s hands and firearm become visible in the foreground after the grenade is thrown and remain visible throughout the rest of the sequence.",
    "Scene": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, and takes place outdoors at night in a dimly lit area with a green night vision effect that casts a monochromatic hue over the scene. The environment features stone or concrete barriers and low walls, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings visible in the background. The ground appears uneven with debris and scattered vegetation, adding to the realism of the environment. Occasional bright, glowing green flames or light sources are visible, providing stark contrast against the otherwise dark surroundings. The character’s hands and a firearm are visible in the foreground, rendered in the same green-tinted night vision style. Overlay elements include a heads-up display (HUD) with ammunition count and weapon icons in the lower right corner, and aiming parameters on the left side of the screen, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the character's targeting capabilities. A small text overlay with dialogue in red and white near the bottom center reads: \"AI-Qatala Fighter 3: Where is the lab?\" providing context to the scene. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but are superimposed for informational purposes.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the viewer’s hands and weapon consistently occupying the lower center and lower right foreground of the frame. The environment, visible in the middle ground and background, consists of stone or concrete barriers and low walls that stretch horizontally across the frame, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings further back, mostly in the upper and central background. At the start, the right hand moves from the lower right foreground to throw a grenade toward the center middle ground, where an enemy figure becomes partially visible and is engulfed in bright green flames, positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. The firearm is then brought up to the lower center and right foreground, remaining steady and aligned with the viewer’s line of sight. The camera height matches the subject’s eye level, maintaining a consistent horizontal perspective throughout the sequence. Overlay elements, such as the HUD and dialogue text, are superimposed in the lower right, bottom center, and left side of the frame, but do not interact with the physical space. The spatial arrangement remains stable, with the main dynamic being the movement of the hand and weapon in the foreground and the appearance of flames and the enemy figure in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
