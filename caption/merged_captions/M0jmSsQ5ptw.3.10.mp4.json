  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman with a tan complexion is positioned in the bottom center foreground in a sprinter's starting stance on a long blue mat, wearing a pink sports bra and black capri-length leggings. Her hands are on the mat, and her feet are on small, specialized platforms. The mat extends from her position diagonally toward the left background. A long, white, fabric-covered structure occupies the middle ground, running parallel to the mat from the right side of the frame into the distance. Ropes and pulleys are visible connecting the structure to equipment near the woman. In the middle ground, a wooden fence is visible, with distant mountains in the background. The scene is set outdoors on a gray, paved lot under a sky with scattered white clouds. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a deep focus, keeping both the woman in the foreground and the long white structure in the middle ground sharp. The camera executes a smooth, clockwise arc to the woman's left, then trucks left to follow her as she prepares to run. The woman starts in a sprinter's starting position on the blue mat, then begins to run. During the shot, the text \"LOLO JONES\" appears as an overlay on the blue mat in the bottom left foreground.",

The camera executes a smooth, clockwise arc to the woman's left, then trucks left to follow her as she prepares to run.",
    "Subject": "A woman with a tan complexion is in a sprinter's starting position on a long blue mat laid out on an asphalt surface. She is wearing a pink sports bra and black capri-length leggings. Her hands are on the mat, and her feet are on small, specialized platforms. A system of ropes and pulleys is connected solely to a very long, white, fabric-covered structure next to the mat. The name \"LOLO JONES\" is written in large, white outlined letters on the blue mat in front of her.",
    "Motion": "The woman starts in a sprinter's starting position on a blue mat, then begins to run.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a gray, paved lot under a sky with scattered white clouds. A very long, rectangular structure covered in white fabric dominates the view, running parallel to a long, dark blue mat laid out on the asphalt. The white structure is secured by a network of ropes, pulleys, and stakes. A wooden fence is positioned between the white structure and a wooden crane-like structure in the middle ground. In the background, a grassy hill and distant mountains are visible on the horizon. An overlay of the text \"LOLO JONES\" appears in white, outlined letters on the blue mat.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
