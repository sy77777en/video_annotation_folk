  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a vertical trail of crumpled gold foil, stacks of paper banknotes, and round, gold-colored coins arranged from the top left to the center of the frame against a solid black background, with an additional pile visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera smoothly tracks forward and tilts up, following this column of gold items. As the camera shifts, the gold items move out of frame, revealing a single, grey, rock-like sculpture with faceted, textured surfaces that remains centered. This sculpture resembles crumpled pieces of paper or small asteroids. As the camera continues its upward movement, the sculpture exits the frame, and a floating, stone-like object is revealed. This first object drifts toward the bottom right of the frame. A second, larger stone appears in the top left, moving towards the bottom right. The camera then pans left, revealing more of the floating rocks against the black background. Above the initial scene, multiple grey, craggy, rock-like objects resembling asteroids gradually enter the frame from the top as the camera moves. These rocks float independently in the black void, distinct from the gold objects below, creating a dynamic scene. The final shot shows a full view of a third stone floating independently in the center of the black void.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly tracks forward and tilts up, following a column of gold items as they transform into gray, rock-like objects. It then pans left, revealing more of the floating rocks against the black background.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a collection of items symbolizing wealth, including crumpled gold foil, stacks of paper banknotes, and round, gold-colored coins, arranged in a vertical trail against a black background. The camera initially focuses on these gold objects before shifting to a complex sculpture. Following this, the scene transitions to display solid, light-grey objects with faceted, textured surfaces, resembling crumpled pieces of paper or small asteroids. These grey, rock-like forms float independently, distinct from the gold objects.",
    "Motion": "A vertical trail of gold foil, banknotes, and coins is shown alongside grey, rock-like objects. As the camera shifts, the gold items move out of frame, revealing the grey objects. Both the gold and grey objects remain stationary in the black space.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a scattered collection of gold-colored foil, coins, and paper stacks is prominently displayed in the foreground. Above them, multiple grey, craggy, rock-like objects resembling asteroids gradually enter the frame from the top as the camera moves. These rocks float in the black void, creating a dynamic scene with the golden materials below.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot of a vertical trail of gold foil, banknotes, and coins arranged from the top left to the center of the frame against a black background, with an additional pile visible in the bottom right foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
