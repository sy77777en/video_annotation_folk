  "merged_caption": "A full shot shows a giant orange pumpkin with deep, horizontal ribs and a slightly textured, matte finish, centered in the middle ground, resting on a wooden platform that spans the bottom of the frame. A dark green baseball cap with a circular logo, featuring a small orange pumpkin and white text, is initially positioned on the platform in the background to the right rear of the pumpkin. The scene is set inside a structure with white fabric walls visible in the background at the top and sides, with concrete blocks positioned on the floor in the bottom left. In this time-lapse video, the large orange pumpkin gradually increases in size on the wooden platform. The green baseball cap shifts from the back right to the middle ground on the right side of the frame and finally moves to the foreground on the platform in the bottom right corner. The camera remains static and is positioned at the pumpkin's level throughout the shot, using a deep focus to keep the giant pumpkin and its surroundings sharp.",

    "Subject": "A very large, round, orange pumpkin with deep, horizontal ribs rests on a wooden platform. Its skin has a slightly textured, matte finish. A dark green baseball cap with a circular logo, which includes a small orange pumpkin and white text, is visible on the platform next to the giant pumpkin.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
