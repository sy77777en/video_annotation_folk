  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, with her head occupying approximately one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly to the right of center. Her body is obscured by foam, placing her in the middle ground, while an unidentified object, possibly a person's leg wearing pants, partially obscures the left foreground. The bathtub edges and surrounding bathroom elements form the background. The radiator is located towards the upper left of the frame's center, and a blue towel hangs on the wall in the upper right corner. The camera is positioned at hip level with a high angle, looking down, employing a shallow depth of field that focuses on the person in the midground. Initially, the woman's face is calm, with cucumber slices covering her eyes, a pink towel wrapped around her head, and headphones on. The camera smoothly zooms in with minor movement, maintaining steadiness throughout. As the video progresses, she lowers her head and gently shakes it, causing the cucumber slices to fall into the bathtub. She then opens her eyes, looks forward, and appears startled by something, opening her mouth wide in what appears to be a scream. The camera maintains a steady position, capturing the transition from a relaxed state to a sudden reaction without any noticeable shift in shot size or angle. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, focusing on the subject's head and upper torso against the backdrop of the bathroom setting, which features a muted color palette and soft natural light, suggesting daytime.",

    "Subject": "The video features a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, obscuring her body below the neck. Her head, positioned slightly to the right of center, occupies about one-third of the frame's height. She has a light skin tone and wears a pink towel wrapped around her head. Her eyes are covered with cucumber slices, and she has headphones on. Initially, her expression is relaxed, but later, the cucumber slices fall, and she seems to see something and scream, with her mouth open wide.",
    "Motion": "A woman is lying in a bathtub filled with bubbles, with a pink towel wrapped around her head and cucumber slices covering her eyes. Initially, she is not looking forward. She lowers her head and gently shakes it, causing the cucumber slices to fall into the bathtub. Afterward, she opens her eyes, looks forward, and appears startled by something, then screams and continues to look upward at an angle.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor bathroom setting with a person relaxing in a bathtub filled with white, frothy bubbles. The room features a radiator and a blue towel. It shows a muted color palette, with soft natural light, suggesting the daytime. The person in the tub has a towel wrapped around their head and wears headphones, with cucumber slices placed over their eyes.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium shot of a woman in a bathtub, with her head occupying approximately one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly to the right of center.

As the video progresses, the cucumber slice on her nose falls, and her expression changes; she opens her mouth wide in what appears to be a scream. The camera maintains a steady position, capturing the transition from a relaxed state to a sudden reaction without any noticeable shift in shot size or angle.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
