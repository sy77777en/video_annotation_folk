  "merged_caption": "The shot opens with choppy water filling most of the screen, while the front portion of a red and white racing catamaran is positioned in the upper right. The catamaran, a hydrofoil with its two long, pointed hulls lifted above the surface, features primarily red hulls with a white section displaying red text. The main body connecting the hulls is also red and white, and its tall, white sail displays red and black markings, including the bottom half of a red \"X\" and a green and gold \"ROLEX\" logo. At least two people, wearing dark outfits and helmets, are visible on the deck. The camera, positioned low and at the subject's level, pans right and tilts up, following the catamaran as it glides at high speed across the water, cutting through the choppy surface and kicking up a significant spray. This movement brings the entire vessel into a medium shot, centered in the middle ground. The shot then widens to a full shot, keeping the red catamaran centered as it moves forward. Concurrently, a second, darker-colored catamaran, possibly black or dark blue with a dark sail, appears in the left background, sailing on a similar course. The camera smoothly tracks the red and white sailboat from a position above the water, beginning at a high angle and arcing clockwise around the vessel while moving backward. As the boat passes, the camera rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle, and moves upward, transitioning to a more level perspective. A hazy shoreline with a distant city and a large bridge is visible on the horizon under an overcast sky. The sailboat is kept in sharp focus with a shallow depth of field, while the background appears blurred.",

    "Subject": "The video features a red and white racing catamaran moving at high speed on the water. The catamaran is a hydrofoil, with its two long, pointed hulls lifted above the surface. These hulls are primarily red with a white section, and red text is visible on the white section. The main body connecting the hulls is also red and white.

At least two people, wearing dark outfits and helmets, are visible on the deck of this catamaran. In the background, a second, darker-colored catamaran, possibly black or dark blue, with a dark sail, is also present.",
    "Motion": "A red and white racing catamaran glides at high speed across the water, its hulls lifted completely above the surface as it hydrofoils. It cuts through the choppy water, kicking up a significant spray. The camera follows the vessel closely, revealing a second, darker catamaran also sailing in the background as the red and white boat continues its rapid forward motion.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed sailing race across a large body of choppy, dark blue-green water under an overcast sky. A red and white racing catamaran, its hulls lifted above the surface on hydrofoils, speeds forward, creating a prominent white wake and spray. In the background, a second, dark-hulled catamaran sails on a similar course. A hazy shoreline with a distant city and a large bridge is visible on the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "The shot opens with choppy water filling most of the screen, while the front portion of a red and white catamaran is positioned in the upper right.

Concurrently, a second, darker catamaran appears in the left background, with a distant shoreline and a bridge spanning the background at the top of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
