  "merged_caption": "The camera work is impressively smooth, effectively tracking a small, illuminated figure in a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face and head. Initially, the camera subtly pulls back from a high, overhead angle, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, before panning to the right to follow the character's movement through the dark setting. The figure, holding a light source, runs from left to right across a dark, planked floor, casting a moving circle of illumination onto the ground. This light bobs as the figure moves, illuminating the immediate surroundings and casting a dynamic shadow. A large, black liquid puddle is visible on the floor on the left side of the frame, positioned between the foreground and middle ground. As the figure runs from the center toward the right side of the frame, staying in the middle ground, the light it carries moves with it, revealing wet patches and several black, amorphous shapes that resemble puddles of a thick, dark liquid or small, shadowy creatures. Some of these shapes twitch slightly as the figure passes. The camera's movement briefly reveals a can-like object, which appears to shift from right to left in the middle ground as the scene progresses. The figure is the sole source of light in this pitch-black indoor space, and the rest of the environment remains in deep shadow.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera movement is very smooth as it tracks a small, illuminated figure in a yellow coat. It initially moves back slightly before trucking right to follow the character's movement through the dark environment.",
    "Subject": "In a dark environment, a small, child-like figure is illuminated by a light source it appears to hold. The figure is clad in a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face and head. Scattered on the floor around this figure are several black, amorphous shapes that resemble puddles of a thick, dark liquid or small, shadowy creatures.",
    "Motion": "A small figure in a yellow raincoat, holding a light source, runs from left to right across a dark floor. The light bobs as the figure moves, illuminating the immediate surroundings and casting a dynamic shadow. The figure runs past several dark, amorphous shapes, some of which twitch slightly as it passes.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video captures a small figure in a bright yellow raincoat running through a pitch-black indoor space. The figure is the sole source of light, casting a moving circle of illumination onto a dark, planked floor. This light reveals wet patches and amorphous dark shapes on the ground, while the rest of the environment remains in deep shadow.",
    "Spatial": "The camera work is impressively smooth, effectively tracking a small, illuminated figure in a yellow raincoat.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
