  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a wooden electric chair positioned centrally in the midground of a stark, institutional room with light-colored walls. The dark brown chair has a high back with four horizontal slats, and visible restraints are attached to its arms and legs, with various wires connected to the structure. A white window frame is visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the chair, while a wall is visible in the background. To the right of the chair, a small electrical box is mounted on the wall. Shot from a level angle, the camera smoothly zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses more tightly on the upper structure of the chair, which remains centered in the frame. The video presents a static, unmoving shot throughout, with no movement occurring in the clip. The low-resolution, grainy quality of the video makes the focus indistinct, and the colors are muted. A small white watermark in the lower left corner reads \"[12,22]; ABC News (1989).\"",

    "Subject": "A low-resolution, grainy video displays a wooden electric chair. The dark brown chair has a high back with four horizontal slats. Straps are attached to the armrests and the front legs, and various wires are connected to the structure. The bottom of the chair is obscured by a white window frame in the foreground, partially blocking the camera view.",

    "Scene": "A dark wooden electric chair stands in a stark, institutional room with light-colored walls. The chair has a high back with horizontal slats, and visible restraints are attached to its arms and legs, with wires running from it. To the right of the chair, a small electrical box is mounted on the wall. The scene is viewed from a fixed position, with the bottom of the chair partially obscured by a white window frame in the foreground. The video quality is grainy, and the colors are muted. A small white watermark in the lower left corner reads \"[12,22]; ABC News (1989).\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a wooden electric chair positioned centrally in the midground. A white window frame is visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the chair, while a wall is visible in the background. To the right of the chair, an electrical box is mounted on the wall. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses more tightly on the upper structure of the chair, which remains centered in the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
