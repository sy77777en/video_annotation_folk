  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on a tomato positioned in the center foreground, with a hose and nozzle extending from the bottom center-right of the frame, aiming a thin, high-pressure water jet vertically through the tomato. The scene is set outdoors during the day, featuring a clear blue sky and lush green trees in the background, creating a bright and vibrant atmosphere. In the middle ground, directly behind the tomato, the out-of-focus head and shoulders of a middle-aged man wearing a red cap and a gray shirt are visible, observing the action with a neutral expression. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the action, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the tomato and hose in the foreground. The video features a speed ramp effect, alternating between slow and even slower motion. The high-pressure water jet shoots upward from the nozzle, slicing through the tomato suspended above it. The jet cuts the tomato vertically from the bottom to the top, causing a spray of water and pulp to erupt from the top surface. As the cut progresses, both halves of the tomato are propelled away by the water, with the pieces exiting the frame from the top left. The focus remains on the tomato and the water jet, highlighting the precision of the cut. The serene background provides a tranquil atmosphere, contrasting with the dynamic action in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot features a speed ramp effect, alternating between slow and even slower motion. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the tomato and hose in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a high-pressure water jet slicing through a tomato suspended in midair. The tomato is prominently featured in the foreground, with its red color and smooth surface clearly visible. In the middle ground, a man is partially visible, wearing a red cap and a gray shirt. His head and shoulders are slightly out of focus, indicating he is observing the action. The man appears to be middle-aged, with short hair and a neutral expression. The focus remains on the tomato and the water jet, highlighting the precision of the cut.",
    "Motion": "A high-pressure water jet shoots upward from a nozzle, slicing through a tomato suspended above it. The jet cuts the tomato vertically from the bottom to the top, causing a spray of water and pulp to erupt from the top surface. Once the cut is complete, the two halves of the tomato are pushed apart by the stream and fall away from the nozzle.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting during the day, featuring a clear blue sky and lush green trees in the background. The environment is bright and vibrant, emphasizing the natural surroundings. The serene background provides a tranquil atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
