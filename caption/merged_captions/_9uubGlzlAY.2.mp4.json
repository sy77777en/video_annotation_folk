  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man with short, dark hair is crouching slightly to the right of the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground amidst dense, tall green reeds and grasses in a dark, outdoor setting. He is dressed in a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt, dark shorts, and boots, and is wearing a watch on his left wrist. The ground is a mixture of dark, wet mud and patches of shorter grass. The scene is illuminated by a headlamp he is wearing, casting a focused beam of light. He holds a long, smooth, light-tan snake with both hands, initially positioning it in front of him while looking down at the swaying snake. The camera, filmed with an unsteady, shaky motion, begins at hip level with a level angle and a varying Dutch angle. As the man lowers the snake, its head becomes visible on the ground in the bottom center foreground. The camera tilts downward to a high angle to focus on the snake at ground level, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. While the man remains slightly off-center, the snake's body moves through the grass, occupying the foreground and middle ground in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and tilts down slightly to follow the snake's movement to the ground, capturing the dynamic interaction between the man and the snake as he lifts and moves the snake's body from side to side in front of him. The environment is otherwise pitch-black, with the headlamp's light highlighting the man crouching in the foliage.",

    "Subject": "A man with short, dark hair is shown in a dark, outdoor setting, illuminated by a headlamp he is wearing. He is crouching on the muddy ground amidst green grass and taller reeds. He is dressed in a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt, dark shorts, and boots. He is holding a long, light-colored snake with both hands, positioning its body in front of him while looking down at the swaying snake. He is also wearing a watch on his left wrist.",
    "Motion": "A man crouching in a dark, grassy area holds a long snake with both hands, lifting and moving the snake's body from side to side in front of him.",
    "Scene": "At night, in a dark outdoor setting, a scene unfolds amidst dense, tall green reeds and grasses. The ground is a mixture of dark, wet mud and patches of shorter grass. The environment is otherwise pitch-black, illuminated only by a focused beam of light that highlights a person crouching in the foliage. The person is holding a long, smooth, light-tan snake, which moves through the illuminated space.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man crouches slightly to the right of the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground with tall reeds behind him in the background. He holds a long snake, which he initially positions in front of him. He then lowers the snake, and its head becomes visible on the ground in the bottom center foreground. While the man remains slightly off-center, the snake's body moves through the grass, occupying the foreground and middle ground in the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
