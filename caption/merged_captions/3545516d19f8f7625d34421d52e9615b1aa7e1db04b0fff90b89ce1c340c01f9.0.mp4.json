  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, capturing a broad expanse of the environment. The lighthouse is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, standing prominently on a rocky shoreline. The video starts with a wide aerial view, prominently featuring a white lighthouse with a red top in the center of the frame, surrounded by a few buildings, including a red-roofed house and a small structure with a red roof. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. It moves smoothly and slowly, both backward and upward, providing a comprehensive view of the area without any shaking. As the camera smoothly moves backward and upward, the lighthouse appears to diminish in size. To the right of the lighthouse, a few small buildings with red roofs are visible, situated slightly further back in the middle ground. The surrounding greenery frames these structures, extending towards the background. On the far right, a tall communication tower rises vertically, located entirely in the middle ground. The coastline curves gently from the bottom left to the top of the frame, bordered by a vast, calm blue sea that stretches across the entire background. The dense forest forms a continuous line along the horizon, separating the land from the sea. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. The camera movement is smooth and steady, providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape, the lighthouse, the buildings, and the natural surroundings. The camera maintains a high vantage point throughout, providing an aerial perspective that emphasizes the vastness of the landscape. The clear sky and bright sunlight enhance the natural colors, creating a serene and picturesque view of the coastal environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial view with a high angle, looking down on a coastal landscape with a lighthouse. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. It moves smoothly and slowly, both backward and upward, providing a comprehensive view of the area without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a coastal area with a prominent lighthouse surrounded by some houses, greenery, rocky shores, and expansive water. Additional, there is a ratio tower on the right side of the frame. The focus is on the vastness and natural beauty of the environment, highlighting the contrast between the land and sea. The lighthouse, while visually striking, is part of the broader landscape, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The video conveys a sense of tranquility and openness, with the sea level stretching into the distance.",
    "Motion": "The video starts with a wide aerial view, prominently featuring a white lighthouse with a red top in the center of the frame, surrounded by a few buildings, including a red-roofed house and a small structure with a red roof. The camera gradually moves backward, revealing more of the coastline, which is lined with rocks and a sandy beach. As the camera continues to pull back, the surrounding landscape becomes visible, showing a dense forest extending into the distance. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. A tall structure, possibly a communication tower, is seen near the forest. The camera movement is smooth and steady, providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape, the lighthouse, the buildings, and the natural surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive coastal landscape during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a prominent white lighthouse with a red top situated on a rocky shoreline. Surrounding the lighthouse are a few small buildings with red roofs, nestled among green trees. The coastline curves gently, bordered by a vast, calm blue sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. A tall communication tower stands nearby, adding a vertical element to the scene. The clear sky and bright sunlight enhance the natural colors, creating a serene and picturesque view of the coastal environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
