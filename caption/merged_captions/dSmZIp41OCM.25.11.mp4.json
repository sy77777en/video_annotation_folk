  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot from a high-angle perspective, positioned as if from a second-story height, capturing a stylized, cartoon-like video game scene. In the middle ground, a scarecrow with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head and a carved smiling face, dressed in a dark grey coat, stands beside a stone well with a spinning reel above it. Both are positioned in the center of the frame, encircled by a circular brick path set within a grassy yard that fills the majority of the scene. The scene is set at dusk, and in the background, at the top of the frame, are garden plots enclosed by white picket fences, with a bush of red flowers nearby. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp, and while it is stationary, it exhibits a slight, subtle unsteadiness. The scarecrow remains still, but the reel above it is spinning. Additionally, the progress bars for the inventory and the blue resource at the bottom of the screen are actively increasing. A game interface is overlaid at the bottom of the screen, featuring a gold coin icon with the number 123 on the bottom left, an inventory bar displaying various bags and items with their respective quantities in the bottom center, and two vertical resource bars on the bottom right, one partially filled with blue and the other full of yellow. The scene is presented in a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, and the heads-up display is part of the overlay.",

    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set in a stylized, grassy yard at dusk. At the center is a stone well, surrounded by a circular brick pathway. A scarecrow-like figure with a pumpkin head and a grey coat stands beside the well. Several garden plots in the background are enclosed by white picket fences, and there is a bush with red flowers nearby. The scene includes a game heads-up display as an overlay. At the bottom left, a coin icon shows the number 123. A central inventory bar displays various items and quantities. On the right, two vertical status bars, one partially filled with blue and the other full of yellow, are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
