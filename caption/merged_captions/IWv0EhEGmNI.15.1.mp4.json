  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a man in dark green military gear, including a tactical vest, gloves, and a helmet with night vision goggles, lying diagonally across the lower right and center of the frame on a pile of broken bricks, holding a black rifle. His head is near the center, and his legs extend toward the bottom right. The exposed brick wall forms the background, occupying the upper left and top portions of the frame. Another man, wearing a camouflage tactical vest over light-colored clothing, leans in from the left side of the frame, his upper body and outstretched right hand entering from the top right corner, reaching toward the man on the ground. The camera, positioned at ground level, captures a level angle shot and then transitions to a low angle as it pans right and tilts upward, focusing on the man standing. As the camera tilts right and then upward, the second character’s upper body becomes prominent in the foreground at the center of the frame. The camera moves to eye level, ending at a high angle as it follows the man being pulled up. After being assisted up, the first-person character places their gloved left hand, wearing a watch, on the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, who is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground, indicating a moment of camaraderie or support. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at or slightly below the eye level of the standing characters, emphasizing the transition from a low, horizontal viewpoint to a more upright, interactive perspective. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, reflecting a first-person perspective. Subtitles in green, yellow, and white appear at the bottom center of the frame, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space, displaying dialogue between characters: \"Kyle: Never been more clear, sir...\", \"Hadir: You'll help me attack the lab, yes?\", and \"Kyle: Not on your life. You're going down for this.\"",

    "Camera": "The video starts with the camera positioned at ground level, capturing a level angle shot of a man lying on rubble. It then transitions to a low angle as it pans right and tilts upward to focus on a man standing. The camera moves to eye level, ending at a high angle as it follows the man being pulled up. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the man in the foreground. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, reflecting a first-person perspective.",
    "Subject": "The video depicts a man with light skin, a full beard, and short dark hair, dressed in dark green military gear, including a tactical vest, gloves, and a helmet with night vision goggles. He is lying on a pile of broken bricks, holding a black rifle, and appears alert and focused. Another man, also with a light complexion, short dark hair, and a beard, is wearing a camouflage tactical vest over light-colored clothing. He leans over and extends his right hand toward the first man, suggesting a first-person perspective interaction. After being helped up, the first-person character places a gloved left hand, wearing a watch, on the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, indicating a moment of camaraderie or support.",
    "Motion": "The man in dark green military gear lies on a pile of broken bricks while holding a rifle. Another man in a camouflage vest leans over and extends his right hand to help the player, represented by the first-person perspective of the camera, to their feet. After being assisted up, the player places their gloved left hand on the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest.",
    "Scene": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors within a dimly lit, partially ruined brick structure. The environment features exposed, uneven brick walls and scattered debris, with a greenish tint dominating the scene, possibly due to lighting effects. A person in military gear, including a dark helmet with mounted equipment and a tactical vest, is positioned on the ground among the rubble, holding a black firearm. Overlay elements include subtitles in green, white, and yellow at the bottom center of the view, displaying dialogue between characters: \"Kyle: Never been more clear, sir...\", \"Hadir: You'll help me attack the lab, yes?\", and \"Kyle: Not on your life. You're going down for this.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a man in military gear lying diagonally across the lower right and center of the frame, positioned in the foreground on a pile of broken bricks, with his head near the center and his legs extending toward the bottom right. The exposed brick wall forms the background, occupying the upper left and top portions of the frame. Another man, partially visible, leans in from the left side of the frame, his upper body and outstretched right hand entering from the top right corner, reaching toward the man on the ground. As the camera tilts right and then upward, the second character’s upper body becomes prominent in the foreground at the center of the frame. The camera, representing the viewer’s perspective, is positioned at ground level, parallel to the man lying down, and then shifts upward as the first-person character is helped up. During this movement, the gloved left hand of the first-person character comes into view from the bottom left, moving toward the center and making contact with the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, who is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at or slightly below the eye level of the standing characters, emphasizing the transition from a low, horizontal viewpoint to a more upright, interactive perspective. Subtitles in green, yellow, and white appear at the bottom center of the frame, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
