  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a canal in Venice from a forward-moving perspective slightly above the water's surface. The canal occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background, flanked on the left and right by historic buildings in the middle ground and background. The scene is dynamic with various boats. Initially, a blue gondola and an orange-white boat are in the center-left. As the camera moves forward, some boats travel from the background to the middle ground and eventually to the foreground before disappearing, while others move forward along with the camera. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains its forward motion, causing the buildings and moored boats along the banks to recede. The camera, positioned on a moving boat, glides along the waterway, capturing views of historic buildings and various other boats. The scene is lively with the movement of gondolas, water taxis, and other vessels on the water. This time-lapse video is captured from a boat's perspective, positioned at a level angle above the water. The camera moves smoothly forward along a river, occasionally shifting left and right to navigate around passing boats. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the foreground boats to the background buildings in sharp detail. The video presents a vibrant cityscape scenery shot, capturing a journey along the bustling Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. The deep blue water ripples with the traffic of numerous vessels, including a traditional gondola being rowed, sleek white motorboats, a larger water taxi, and a distinctive blue and white police boat. Lining both sides of the canal are historic, multi-story buildings with a mix of white, orange, and yellow facades, featuring arched windows and terracotta-tiled roofs, all set against a clear, bright blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
