  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing the woman from the waist up. The woman, identified by her name tag as Annie, is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground. She is wearing a white shirt under a maroon vest and a black bow tie, with her hair tied back, and she has a medium skin tone. Her 2D position is centered horizontally and slightly higher vertically, aligning with the camera's height at her level. In the foreground, a plate of food and a glass with a lemon slice are placed directly in front of her, slightly to the left. To the right side of the frame, another person wearing a yellow garment is partially visible, situated in the same middle ground as Annie. The background includes tables with white tablecloths and wall art, providing depth to the scene. The setting is indoors in a restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere, featuring tables covered with white tablecloths, creating a formal dining environment. The lighting is soft, contributing to a cozy ambiance. Notable visual elements include a glass of lemonade with a slice of lemon and a plate of food, adding to the dining context. The walls are adorned with artwork, enhancing the restaurant's decor. Annie appears to be speaking to the camera throughout the video. The camera is at eye level and positioned at a level angle, focusing on the woman in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera remains completely static, maintaining a consistent perspective focused on the dining setup and the subjects. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the dining experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
