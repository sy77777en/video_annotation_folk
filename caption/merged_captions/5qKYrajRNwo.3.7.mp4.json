  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a young girl puppet with dark skin and large, round eyes, sitting cross-legged in the center-left of the foreground on a cluttered floor in a dimly lit room. She wears a simple, sleeveless, off-white dress and initially has her eyes lowered while her right hand plays with a long wooden stick. To her right, on the left side of the frame in the foreground, is a small woven basket. In the center background, a second puppet of a woman with dark skin and large, dark eyes is seated out of focus, wearing a reddish-brown top and engaged in an activity with her hands. Various household items, including a green and white bucket on the right, are scattered throughout the middle ground and background, rendered in dark, earthy tones of brown and gray. A warm light source in the left background casts a soft glow, leaving much of the room in shadow. The girl slightly raises her eyes to look towards the right side of the frame before quickly lowering them again to pick up an open book. Holding the book up, she begins to read from it, lifting it closer to her face. The camera remains static, filmed from a hip-level position with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the girl puppet in focus in the foreground while the background remains blurred.",

    "Camera": "This is a stop-motion video filmed from a static, hip-level position with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the girl puppet in focus in the foreground while the background is blurred.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, cluttered room, a young girl, depicted as a stop-motion puppet, sits in the foreground. She has dark skin, and her black hair is styled in two braids. Her most prominent and atypical feature is her large, round eyes. She wears a simple, sleeveless, off-white dress and is seated cross-legged on the floor, holding an open book. In the background, another puppet figure of a woman is seated. This woman also has dark skin and the same large, dark eyes. She wears a reddish-brown top and is engaged in an activity with her hands.",
    "Motion": "A young girl puppet, sitting cross-legged on the floor, initially has her eyes lowered while her right hand plays with a long wooden stick. She then slightly raises her eyes to look towards the right side of the frame before quickly lowering them again to pick up an open book. Holding the book up, she begins to read from it. In the background, the puppet of a woman remains seated with minimal, indistinct movement.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a single, dimly lit room with a rough, uneven floor. The space is cluttered with an assortment of household items, including pots, a green and white bucket, and woven baskets, all rendered in dark, earthy tones of brown and gray. A warm light source in the background casts a soft glow, leaving much of the room in shadow. In the foreground, a puppet of a young girl in a light-colored dress sits on the floor, holding a small book. A second puppet is visible in the out-of-focus background, seated among the various objects that fill the space.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot frames a young girl puppet sitting in the center-left of the foreground on a cluttered floor. To her right, on the left side of the frame in the foreground, is a small woven basket. In the center background, a second puppet of a woman is seated out of focus. Various household items, including a green and white bucket on the right, are scattered throughout the middle ground and background. A light source is visible in the left background. The girl, initially holding a book in her lap, lifts it closer to her face. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
