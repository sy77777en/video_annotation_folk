  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a minimalist scene from a side-view perspective. Initially, a hand-drawn figure in black ink, wearing a white hat with a black dot on top, is depicted riding a unicycle in the blank area between two curved lines. The figure moves from left to right along a concave path, launching into the air, traveling upward and to the right, and landing on a second, S-shaped path. The camera smoothly tracks the character, primarily trucking to the right with slight upward and downward movements to follow the character as it slides along the drawn line. The figure continues along this new path, moving uphill and then launching off the end, traveling through the air again before landing on a third, smaller concave path. In the top-left, the letter 'P' and another curved line are visible, along with a rest symbol and the number \"10.\" A few small dots in blue, green, and red are visible near the figure. The scene is set against a solid light gray background, where several disconnected, hand-drawn black lines form a series of curved, undulating paths. The camera keeps the figure near the center of the frame as it follows the movement, capturing the minimalist, abstract environment in profile.",

    "Camera": "From a side view, the smooth camera tracks the character in a line game. It primarily trucks to the right, with slight upward and downward movements to follow the character as it slides along the drawn line.",
    "Subject": "A minimalist, hand-drawn figure in black ink, wearing a white hat with a black dot on top, is depicted riding a unicycle, which is also rendered as a simple black line drawing on a curved path. A few small dots in blue, green, and red are visible near the figure. In the upper left portion of the scene, the letter 'P' is hand-drawn in black ink above a separate curved line.",
    "Motion": "A hand-drawn figure on a unicycle moves from left to right along a concave path. It then launches into the air, travels upward and to the right, and lands on a second, S-shaped path. The figure continues along this new path, moving uphill and then launching off the end. It travels through the air again before landing on a third, smaller concave path.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, shows a minimalist, abstract environment. Against a solid light gray background, several disconnected, hand-drawn black lines form a series of curved, undulating paths. In the upper left corner, a hand-drawn letter 'P', a rest symbol, and the number \"10\" are visible. A small, cartoonish figure on a bicycle travels along these black lines.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme wide shot presents a minimalist scene from a side-view perspective. Initially, a hand-drawn figure on a unicycle is positioned in the blank area between two curved lines. In the top-left, the letter 'P' and another curved line are visible. The unicyclist travels from left to right along its path, and the camera trucks right to follow the movement, keeping the figure near the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
