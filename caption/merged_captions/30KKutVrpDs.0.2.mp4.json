  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a light-skinned young man with short, brown hair stands in the right-center of the frame and the middle ground, wearing a yellow short-sleeved t-shirt with a black and white logo on the chest that includes the letters \"SC.\" He is positioned in front of a house with light blue horizontal siding, white trim around the windows, and weathered concrete steps with a simple white metal railing leading up to a dark door. Several playing cards, including a King of Spades and a Ten of Diamonds, are suspended in the air in the foreground in front of him, creating a dynamic scene. The young man stands motionless with his right arm extended and leaning forward, as if poised to throw or catch the cards. The camera, from an unsteady, eye-level perspective, arcs clockwise around the man, keeping him as the central point of the arc and capturing the stillness from different angles. This movement shifts the man's position to the left side of the frame and changes the background to include more of the house's side, a yard with green trees, bushes, and a dirt road running behind the foliage under an overcast sky. The ground is damp, and a grassy area with some dirt patches is visible. The floating cards also move relative to the background, ending up scattered in the air in the center and right portions of the frame. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp, and maintains a level angle throughout. In the distance, another house is visible, completing the outdoor setting during the day.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera arcs clockwise around a man standing in front of some steps. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp, and maintains a level angle throughout.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned young man with short, brown hair is shown wearing a yellow short-sleeved t-shirt with a black and white logo on the chest that includes the letters \"SC\". He stands with his right arm extended forward as if throwing something. Several standard playing cards, including a King of Spades and a Ten of Diamonds, are visible in the air around him, seemingly in mid-flight.",
    "Motion": "A young man in a yellow T-shirt stands motionless with his right arm extended and leaning forward, as if poised to throw or catch playing cards. Four cards are suspended in mid-air in front of his arm, creating a dynamic scene. The camera moves clockwise around the man and the cards, capturing the stillness from different angles.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day in the yard of a house with light blue horizontal siding and white trim around the windows. A set of weathered concrete steps with a simple white metal railing leads up to a dark door. The camera rotates clockwise around a man in yellow clothing and some playing cards, revealing more of the house's side and a background of green trees and bushes. The ground is damp, and a grassy area with some dirt patches is visible. In the distance, a dirt path runs behind the foliage, along with bushes, trees, and another house, under an overcast sky.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a young man stands in the right-center of the frame and the middle ground, in front of a house with concrete steps. Several playing cards are suspended in the air in the foreground in front of him. As the video progresses, the camera rotates clockwise around the man, keeping him as the central point of the arc. This movement shifts the man's position to the left side of the frame and changes the background to include the side of the house, a yard with trees, bushes, and a dirt road. The floating cards also move relative to the background, ending up scattered in the air in the center and right portions of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
