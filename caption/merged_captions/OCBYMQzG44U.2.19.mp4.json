  "merged_caption": "This wide shot of an interior environment is captured from a level angle, with dark water extending from the foreground to the background. The scene is set within a large, indoor pool area, with the camera positioned in dark, rippling water, looking across the surface. The surrounding walls are covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, reflecting the glow from rectangular light fixtures on the ceiling. In the background, a dark, circular opening is positioned at the waterline, set against a wall of white tiles. The scene is defined by the contrast between the clean, white-tiled walls and the dark, murky water, with a prominent dark, circular tunnel at the far end. The only movement is the gentle rippling of the water's surface. By the end of the video, a set of white stairs, initially in the right background, shifts to the center of the frame. The tiled walls and ceiling are visible across the upper portion of the frame. The camera performs a quick, smooth pan to the left, pausing briefly in the middle of the movement. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion, and the deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. Overhead fluorescent lights cast a warm white glow on the scene, illuminating the dark, circular tunnel opening at the waterline on the far wall and a set of white, tiled stairs ascending out of the water on the right. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange, empty space rather than any specific entity within it.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a level angle, at water level, with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera performs a quick, smooth pan to the left, pausing briefly in the middle of the movement.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an interior scenery shot of a liminal, pool-like environment. Filmed from a level angle at the surface of dark, murky water, the scene captures a large, sterile room where the walls are covered in small, white, grid-like tiles. Overhead fluorescent lights cast a warm white glow on the scene, illuminating a dark, circular tunnel opening at the waterline on the far wall and a set of white, tiled stairs ascending out of the water on the right. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange, empty space rather than any specific entity within it.",
    "Motion": "This video clip presents a static, water-level view from inside a stark, tiled room that resembles a swimming pool. The scene is defined by the contrast between the clean, white-tiled walls and the dark, murky water, with a prominent dark, circular tunnel at the far end. The only movement is the gentle rippling of the water's surface.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person point of view at water level, the scene is set within a large, indoor pool area. The camera is positioned in dark, rippling water, looking across the surface. The surrounding walls are covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, which reflect the glow from rectangular light fixtures on the ceiling. Directly ahead, a large, circular, black opening is embedded in the tiled wall at the water's edge. In the background to the right, a set of wide, white stairs ascends out of the water.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot of an interior environment is captured from a level angle, with dark water extending from the foreground to the background. In the background, a dark, circular opening is positioned at the waterline, set against a wall of white tiles. By the end of the video, a set of white stairs, initially in the right background, shifts to the center of the frame. The tiled walls and ceiling are visible across the upper portion of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
