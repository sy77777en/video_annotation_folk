  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a bright red Ferrari 360 Modena positioned in the middle ground, parked within white painted lines on the left side of a city street. A large, multi-story building with a light-colored stone facade and numerous windows occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while a silver sedan is parked much further behind the red Ferrari. Trees are visible behind the silver car. The camera, from an unsteady, handheld, eye-level perspective, moves forward while panning left and tilting slightly downward to follow the red Ferrari, causing the camera angle to shift from level to a high angle. This motion transitions into a full shot of the red car, which has a sleek, low-profile design and features silver, five-spoke, star-shaped wheels with yellow center caps. In the final framing, the car is centered in the frame and remains in the middle ground, while the building occupies the top of the frame. On the right side of the street, a large white van is parked, with a gray sedan in front of it. The street is flanked by a grand, multi-story building with a light-colored stone facade and numerous rectangular windows. Further down the road, a white van is visible, along with a silver sedan and some green, leafy trees. The video maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp. The red Ferrari 360 Modena is stationary, parked within the designated lines on the left side of a city street. No movement occurs throughout the video. A watermark remains fixed in the bottom-right corner throughout the shot, displaying the text \"the STRADMAN\" in red and black lettering.",

    "Scene": "From a first-person point of view, the scene unfolds on a city street during the day under an overcast sky, with the camera moving closer to a parked vehicle. A bright red, low-profile sports car with five-spoke silver wheels rests in a parking bay delineated by white lines on the dark asphalt. The street is flanked by a grand, multi-story building with a light-colored stone facade and numerous rectangular windows. Further down the road, a white van is visible, along with a silver sedan and some green, leafy trees. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"the Stradman\" in red and white.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
