  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, capturing a valley surrounded by lush, green hills. In the initial frame, the camera is positioned high above, looking down at the scene. The left side of the frame features clusters of buildings with light-colored roofs in the foreground, while dense trees cover the hills on the right, extending into the middle ground. The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive outdoor landscape during daylight, showcasing a rural area nestled in a valley surrounded by lush, green hills and mountains. The terrain is dotted with clusters of trees and fields, displaying a patchwork of green and yellow hues. As the camera moves forward and slightly to the right, maintaining its high angle, more of the valley is revealed, with additional buildings and fields becoming visible in the middle ground. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The movement is smooth, with the camera moving forward and tilting up, capturing the landscape below. The video begins with an aerial view of a village, showing several houses with white and red roofs, surrounded by green fields and patches of trees. As the camera moves forward, more houses and buildings come into view, including some with distinct tower-like structures. Finally, as the camera moves forward and slightly tilts up, more houses in the valley come into view on the right side of the frame, and the distant mountains also come into the background, providing a consistent backdrop. The video concludes with a wide view of the village and the expansive green fields, with mountains visible in the background. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural beauty of the landscape highlighted by the clear sky and gentle sunlight.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
