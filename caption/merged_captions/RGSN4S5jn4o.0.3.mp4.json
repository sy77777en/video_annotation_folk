  "merged_caption": "The 2D video begins with a wide shot from the subject's level, capturing a man in a purple shirt with a yellow and black striped pattern, wearing a helmet and knee pads, skateboarding in the right foreground of a skatepark. Animated smoke effects trail the skateboarder, while an animated creature is positioned in the left middle ground. A city skyline is visible in the left background, with palm trees silhouetted against a colorful sky in the middle ground and background. The camera starts at eye level, initially using a high angle, and smoothly pans left as the skateboarder moves upward and to the left, with colorful animated elements like a sun, flying vehicles, and horses appearing around him, adding vibrant energy. The camera then tilts up and zooms in, transitioning to a full, low-angle shot of a large, brightly lit billboard displaying the phrase \"The World is Your Canvas\" in bold, colorful letters, which becomes the central subject in the middle ground. The city skyline with illuminated buildings is now in the background below the billboard, enhancing the urban setting. An animated iguana is on the billboard's left support structure in the middle ground, and an animated UFO is in the top right. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, with smooth movements and minimal shaking. The transition from the skatepark to the billboard suggests a theme of creativity and expression, combining natural and urban elements with creative, animated visuals to create a lively and imaginative environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
