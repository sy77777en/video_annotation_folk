  "merged_caption": "A full shot of a woman with dark, styled hair wearing a purple headscarf or headband and an orange crew-neck dress under a white lab coat, paired with dark heels, is initially positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a long, brightly lit medical facility hallway. The camera, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, moves backward slightly unsteadily, leading the woman as she walks steadily forward, pushing a two-tiered, wheeled metal cart that holds electronic equipment on the top shelf and a clipboard on the bottom. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the woman and the entire length of the corridor in sharp detail. As she proceeds, she passes a reception area where a second woman in a light-colored nurse's uniform and cap is seated at a desk on the left, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground, and then to the background as the camera continues to track backward. The corridor, with a light-colored floor, white walls, sections of brown wood paneling, and simple, round ceiling lights, passes several wooden doors before opening into a spacious ward. The camera tracks backward through a doorway, revealing a man in a dark uniform sitting in a chair on the left, who initially appears in the foreground and, as the camera tracks backward, transitions to the middle ground and finally to the background. The ward contains multiple white, metal-framed hospital beds, some separated by green privacy curtains, with sunlight streaming in from large windows. The shot concludes with the woman and her cart in the center middle ground, framed by the man on the left, who looks up and greets her as she enters, and empty hospital beds on both sides of the room. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot.",

    "Camera": "This video is filmed from an eye-level, level angle. The slightly unsteady camera moves backward, leading a woman in a white coat as she pushes a medical cart down a long hallway. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the woman and the entire length of the corridor in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a woman with dark, styled hair wearing a purple headscarf or headband and an orange crew-neck dress under a white lab coat, paired with dark heels. She is walking directly toward the camera while pushing a two-tiered, wheeled metal cart that holds electronic equipment on the top shelf and a clipboard on the bottom. As she proceeds down a hallway, a second woman in a light-colored nurse's uniform and cap enters the frame from the left foreground and gradually shifts to the background as the camera moves. The main subject then enters a room where a man in a dark uniform is sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, reading a document. He looks up as she enters and greets her.",
    "Motion": "A woman in a white lab coat walks steadily toward the camera, pushing a wheeled metal cart down a long hallway. As she proceeds, she passes a reception area where another woman in a nurse's uniform is seated at a desk. The woman in the lab coat then enters a hospital room, continuing to push the cart forward. Inside the room, a man in a dark uniform, who is sitting in a chair and reading, looks up as she enters.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place during the day inside a brightly lit medical facility. The view moves steadily down a long, straight corridor with a light-colored floor, white walls, and sections of brown wood paneling. Along the hallway are several wooden doors, some with small windows and others without, and simple, round ceiling lights. The corridor passes a reception desk before opening into a spacious ward. This larger room contains multiple white, metal-framed hospital beds, some separated by green privacy curtains. Sunlight streams into the ward from large windows. A stainless steel medical cart on wheels is pushed through the space.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot of a woman pushing a cart is initially positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a long hallway. The camera tracks backward at the same pace that the woman walks forward, maintaining her central position and consistent size within the frame. As the camera moves, a reception desk with another person appears on the left, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground, and then to the background. The camera continues to track backward through a doorway, revealing a man sitting in a chair on the left, who initially appears in the foreground and, as the camera tracks backward, transitions to the middle ground and finally to the background, as it enters a large hospital ward. The shot concludes with the woman and her cart in the center middle ground, framed by the man on the left and empty hospital beds on both sides of the room. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
