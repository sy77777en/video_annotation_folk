  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up frames an animated, older man with white hair and a grey suit in the foreground, positioned on the right side of the screen. He holds a large, rectangular image in the foreground, which occupies the left half of the frame. His right hand extends from the right toward the left, with his index finger pointing at a vertical, irregular geometric shape depicted against a teal background on the image. The shape has a mottled texture with hints of green and purple. The man's expression is focused as he examines the detail he is pointing to. In the background, a blurred geometric structure is visible in the center-right, and a wooden surface sits at the bottom of the frame, enhancing the overall indoor ambiance. The camera zooms in on the man, with a slightly unsteady clockwise rotation, capturing the scene from the subject's height. Throughout the video, the animated man remains completely still, holding the image and pointing at it without any discernible movement. The background is softly blurred, showing the indistinct outline of a gray geometric shape composed of rectangles. This is a 2D video.",

    "Subject": "An animated, older man with white hair and a grey suit is shown in profile, looking intently at a rectangular image he holds in his hands. He points with his right index finger at a vertical, slightly rectangular, irregular geometric shape depicted against a teal background on the image.

    "Motion": "The animated man remains completely still throughout the video, holding an image and pointing at it without any discernible movement.",
    "Scene": "In an animated indoor setting, an older man with white hair, wearing a grey suit, holds up a large, teal-colored panel. He points his index finger at a vertical, irregular geometric shape depicted on the panel. The background is softly blurred, showing a wooden surface and the indistinct outline of a gray geometric shape composed of rectangles, enhancing the overall indoor ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
