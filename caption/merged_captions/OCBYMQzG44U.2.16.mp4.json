  "merged_caption": "This wide shot of an architectural scene emphasizes the environment rather than a specific subject. From a level-angle perspective positioned at the surface of the water, dark, rippling water fills the entire foreground and seamlessly extends into the background, creating a continuous visual flow. In the middle ground, a dark, rounded object is partially submerged left of center. The scene is flanked by an off-white tiled wall on the left and another wall on the right, while a curved ceiling with two rows of square lights occupies the top of the frame. In the background, centered at the far end of the hall, a raised circular platform stands before a tall, brightly lit doorway. The camera, positioned just above the water's surface, captures the scene with a level angle and mild barrel distortion. Using a deep focus that keeps the entire environment sharp, the camera smoothly moves forward while panning left, then trucks slightly to the right. This architectural scenery shot captures a surreal, flooded interior, creating a liminal and unsettling atmosphere. The sterile, off-white walls rise towards a curved ceiling fitted with square, recessed lights that cast a greenish glow over the murky water, which occupies the lower half of the frame. The camera's movement emphasizes the ripples and reflections as the view extends towards the raised platform and tall doorway in the distance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the strange and expansive environment. The scale of the architecture and the mysterious quality of the water are used to evoke a specific mood rather than to draw attention to any single object.",

    "Subject": "This architectural scenery shot captures a surreal, flooded interior, creating a liminal and unsettling atmosphere. A long, white hall with a curved ceiling is illuminated by rows of square lights, casting a greenish, hazy glow over the dark, murky water that fills the space. The camera is positioned at water level, emphasizing the ripples and reflections as the view extends towards a raised platform and a tall doorway in the distance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the strange and expansive environment. The scale of the architecture and the mysterious quality of the water are used to evoke a specific mood rather than to draw attention to any single object.",
    "Motion": "This is a level-angle shot of a large, flooded hallway with a liminal and eerie aesthetic. The camera smoothly moves forward while panning left and then slightly trucks to the right, positioned just above the surface of the murky water, looking down the long, white corridor toward a distant doorway.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle perspective, the scene unfolds within a long, partially flooded hall. The sterile, off-white walls, one of which is tiled in a grid pattern, rise towards a curved ceiling fitted with two rows of square, recessed lights. These lights cast a greenish glow over the murky water, which occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. At the far end of the expansive room, a raised circular platform stands before a tall, narrow, brightly lit doorway. A dark, rounded object, resembling a hole in the wall, is partially submerged in the water in the middle distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
