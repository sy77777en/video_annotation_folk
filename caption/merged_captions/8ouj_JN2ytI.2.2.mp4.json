  "merged_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man in his late 50s or early 60s with short, neatly combed gray hair, fair skin, and a stern facial expression stands completely still in the center foreground, wearing a dark blue military service dress uniform jacket adorned with a large array of colorful ribbon bars, a silver pilot wings insignia on the left breast, metallic star insignia on the shoulder straps, various emblems on the lapels, and a name tag on the right breast. A light blue shirt and a dark necktie are visible at the collar. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a serious atmosphere, likely a control or command center, featuring dark walls and subdued lighting, creating a focused and intense setting. The background includes blurred screens emitting a soft glow, suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment. To his behind right, the left of frame, another man is partially visible in the background. In the background, a third man stands on the right of frame, and a fourth figure is positioned in the center, directly behind the main subject. The background features dark walls with vertical white lines, and there are monitors located on the right and center. The camera, in a level, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, keeps the man in the military uniform in sharp focus and moves forward slowly and smoothly toward him. The other individuals in the background are mostly motionless, except for the individual to the right of the central man, who makes a slight movement with his head. The overall ambiance is formal and professional, with a sense of authority and purpose.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
