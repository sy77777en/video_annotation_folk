  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot showing a man suspended in the sky, positioned near the center-right of the frame and occupying the middle ground, with a strong beam of light originating from the background and extending across the frame. The snowy ground and tall, bare trees with dark, rough bark fill the lower and side portions of the frame, creating a sense of enclosure and depth. The camera is positioned lower than the suspended man, capturing him from a low angle. The man is dressed in dark, heavy clothing with visible straps and armor-like elements, suggesting protective gear, and his face is mostly obscured by shadows. The lighting is dim and bluish, contributing to a stark, wintry atmosphere. The scene transitions as the camera quickly and unsteadily zooms in and pans left to follow the first man as he moves towards another man crouched low to the ground. The first man kicks the second man, propelling him backward towards the left side of the frame, where he eventually crashes into a tree and comes to a stop. The second man, also wearing dark, protective clothing with metallic or leather components, is crouched low in the bottom left of the frame and situated in the middle ground, while the snowy forest and trees recede into the background. The camera remains at the subject’s level, maintaining a consistent perspective, with the movement being slightly unsteady and accompanied by some shaking, emphasizing the dynamic action between the fighters. The air appears cold and still, with no visible precipitation or wind movement, and the overall color palette consists mainly of dark blues, grays, and blacks. The switch between subjects is achieved through a shift in focus and framing, while the spatial relationship to the forest environment remains consistent.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. It quickly and unsteadily zooms in and pans left to follow a fighter as they kick another fighter away, with the movement being slightly unsteady and accompanied by some shaking. The fast camera motion emphasizes the dynamic action between the fighters.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a man suspended in the sky, partially illuminated by a strong beam of light. He is dressed in dark, heavy clothing that appears rugged and practical, with visible straps and armor-like elements, suggesting protective gear. His face is mostly obscured by shadows, but his posture is alert and tense. The scene then transitions to another man, who is crouched low to the ground. This second man also wears dark, protective clothing with metallic or leather components, and his body language indicates caution or readiness, as he appears to be bracing himself or preparing to move. The switch between subjects occurs through a shift in focus, moving from the man in the sky to the crouched man, both of whom share similar attire and a sense of preparedness, but are distinguished by their poses and the way they are lit.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a man flying through the sky, illuminated by a strong beam of light, as he moves towards another man crouched low to the ground. The first man kicks the second man, propelling him backward towards the left side of the frame, where he eventually crashes into a tree and comes to a stop.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a dense, shadowy forest at night, with the ground covered in a layer of snow or frost that reflects the limited ambient light. Tall, bare trees with dark, rough bark and tangled branches dominate the environment, creating a sense of enclosure. The lighting is dim and bluish, with a strong beam of light cutting through the darkness in one section, casting long shadows and illuminating patches of the snowy ground. The air appears cold and still, with no visible precipitation or wind movement. The overall color palette is muted, consisting mainly of dark blues, grays, and blacks, contributing to a stark, wintry atmosphere. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present within the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot showing the first man suspended in the sky, positioned near the center-right of the frame and occupying the middle ground, with a strong beam of light originating from the background and extending across the frame. The snowy ground and tall trees fill the lower and side portions of the frame, with the trees extending from the foreground to the background, creating depth. The camera is positioned lower than the suspended man, capturing him from a low angle. The scene then transitions to a wide shot of the second man, who is crouched low in the bottom left of the frame and situated in the middle ground, while the snowy forest and trees recede into the background and fill the rest of the frame. The camera remains at the subject’s level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The switch between subjects is achieved through a shift in focus and framing, moving from the elevated, central position of the first man to the lower, left position of the second man, while the spatial relationship to the forest environment remains consistent."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
