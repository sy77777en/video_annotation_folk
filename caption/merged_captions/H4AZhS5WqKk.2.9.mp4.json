  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, positioning the camera above the scene. A 2D animated gray-blue cartoon cat, recognizable as Tom from the \"Tom and Jerry\" series, is superimposed in the center-left of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a large bed. The cat has a lighter gray-blue torso, a white muzzle, white paws, and pink inner ears. The bed itself occupies the center and bottom of the frame, also in the middle ground, with its beige headboard extending into the background at the top-center. To the right, a nightstand sits in the middle ground, holding a telephone, while a lamp on it reaches into the top-right background. A corresponding nightstand is positioned on the left in the middle ground, with wine glasses on its surface. The scene captures a modern bedroom illuminated by warm artificial light, with a tall, beige, vertically tufted headboard, white pillows, and a sage-green quilted blanket. The cartoon cat stands on the bed, using its left hand to open the green bottle with a red and yellow patterned sticker featuring blue letters, causing the liquid inside to spray out along with the brownish-yellow mouse, Jerry. Jerry's head hits the ceiling and then bounces back down. The camera executes a quick and smooth motion, tilting up and panning right to track the cartoon character, Jerry. This movement causes the camera angle to shift from high to low. The atypical appearance stems from the superimposition of this flat, animated character onto a photorealistic, three-dimensional bedroom scene, creating a stark contrast between the two visual styles.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead, high-angle perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus. The camera executes a quick and smooth motion, tilting up and panning right to track the cartoon character, Jerry. This movement causes the camera angle to shift from high to low.",
    "Subject": "A gray-blue cartoon cat, recognizable as Tom from the \"Tom and Jerry\" series, is the central subject, presented in a 2D animation style. The cat has a lighter gray-blue torso, a white muzzle, white paws, and pink inner ears. He is depicted standing on a bed, hunched over and holding a green bottle with a red and yellow patterned sticker featuring blue letters. The atypical appearance stems from the superimposition of this flat, animated character onto a photorealistic, three-dimensional bedroom scene, creating a stark contrast between the two visual styles.",
    "Motion": "The cartoon cat stands on the bed, using its left hand to open the bottle's cap, causing the liquid inside to spray out along with the brownish-yellow mouse, Jerry. Jerry's head hits the ceiling and then bounces back down.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene captures a modern bedroom illuminated by warm artificial light. In the center is a large bed with a tall, beige, vertically tufted headboard. The bed is neatly made with white pillows and a sage-green quilted blanket. Flanking the bed are two dark, rectangular nightstands with metallic gold frames. On the right nightstand sits a lamp with a white rectangular shade and a black telephone. The left nightstand holds a matching lamp and several empty wine glasses. An animated, blue-grey cartoon cat is overlaid on the scene, standing on the bed and holding a green bottle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
