  "merged_caption": "This is a quiet wide shot of a city street, with the environment serving as the main focus. The street is positioned in the center of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground and receding into the foggy background, creating a strong sense of depth. On the left side of the frame, a line of parked cars extends from the middle ground into the background, situated next to a row of buildings. On the right, another row of buildings with prominent black support posts for their balconies extends from the middle ground into the background. The camera is positioned at an eye-level height, capturing a straight-on view down the length of the empty street. The video captures a quiet, misty street in an urban setting, likely in the early morning. The scene is outdoors, featuring a narrow street with parked cars on one side. The buildings are characterized by wrought-iron balconies and pastel-colored facades, typical of historic architecture. The street is wet, suggesting recent rain, and the overcast sky adds to the subdued atmosphere. Trees with sparse foliage are visible along the sidewalk, and the street is empty of people, enhancing the tranquil and deserted feel. The overall color palette is muted, with soft grays and greens dominating the scene. The camera makes a subtle and slight pan from right to left, utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field, gradually revealing more of the street and the buildings while the scene remains mostly stationary. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the mood of the street with its architecture, parked cars, and misty ambiance. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall setting and the feeling it conveys, rather than a specific object or person.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
