  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a young adult woman with long, wavy, light-colored hair styled with the top section pulled back from her face, wearing a light-colored, sleeveless dress with a V-neckline and a draped bodice. She stands with her eyes closed and head tilted back as if in serene contemplation, in a low-light, blue-toned outdoor setting, either early morning or evening. The camera, positioned at eye level with a shallow depth of field, performs a smooth counterclockwise arc around her, keeping her in focus against a dark background. As the camera moves, the out-of-focus background shifts, first revealing the silhouette of a large building with windows, followed by a row of large, light-colored vintage trucks, and a blurred forest, all softened by the atmospheric lighting. The woman remains the central focus throughout the movement, her position transitioning from a frontal view to a profile, then briefly to a three-quarter back view, before settling back into a three-quarter front view. During this motion, she slightly tilts her head upward, takes a deep breath, and eventually opens her mouth to smile joyfully.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the woman in the foreground in focus. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around her.",
    "Subject": "A young adult woman with long, wavy, light-colored hair is shown in a low-light, blue-toned setting. Her hair is styled with the top section pulled back from her face. She wears a light-colored, sleeveless dress with a V-neckline and a draped bodice. The camera arcs counterclockwise around her, capturing her from various angles. Her eyes are closed, and her head is tilted back as if she is taking a deep breath or is in a state of serene contemplation. Eventually, she opens her mouth and smiles joyfully.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands with her eyes closed and head tilted back. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc around her. She slightly tilts her head upward, takes a breath, and then smiles.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in the early morning or the evening, enveloped in a deep, cool-toned blue light. In the softly out-of-focus background, the dark silhouette of a large building with windows is faintly visible against the dim sky, alongside indistinct trees and a blurred forest. A row of large, light-colored vintage trucks is also present in the background, their forms blurred and softened by the low, atmospheric lighting.",
    "Spatial": "A medium close-up shot centers on a woman against a dark background. The camera then executes a smooth counterclockwise arc around her. As the camera moves, the out-of-focus background shifts, first revealing the silhouette of a large building in the background, followed by a row of vintage trucks, with a blurred forest also in the background. The woman remains the central focus throughout the movement, her position transitioning from a frontal view to a profile, then briefly to a three-quarter back view, before settling back into a three-quarter front view. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
