  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a dark wooden door, centrally positioned in the frame, with light seeping through its edges. The door features a silver doorknob and a peephole, and is in the middle ground, while the surrounding light-colored walls are positioned further back in the background. The camera is positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus to ensure a large depth of field where most of the scene is sharp. As the camera moves backward (dollying out), the shot transitions to a wide view, revealing more of the room's interior. On the left side of the frame, a side table with a lamp, a framed photo, and a green bowl is visible in the foreground. Above this table, a framed picture is mounted on the wall in the background. To the right of the door, a larger, vertically oriented framed artwork containing a predominantly red and dark pattern is visible on the wall, also in the background, with a shoe rack situated beneath it. In the lower right corner, a potted plant appears in the foreground. The camera maintains a straight-on view throughout the zoom-out transition, positioned at a height level with the door, and the backward movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting some shaking. As the camera continues to pull back, a bench with a pair of shoes on the floor next to it becomes visible. The overall lighting is quite dim, making it difficult to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime. The setting itself is the primary point of interest, with the composition enhancing the mood and sense of place.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where most of the scene is sharp. Focusing on the door, the camera moves backward (dollying out) to reveal more of the room's interior. This backward movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting some shaking.",
    "Subject": "This video captures the interior scenery of a dimly lit room, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject. The composition features a dark wooden door with a sliver of light visible through its crack, flanked by a wall with a light switch, a framed picture, and a side table holding a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork hangs on the wall. The camera dynamically zooms out to include the table and lamp on the left, as well as a potted plant in the lower right corner, enhancing the mood and sense of place, with the setting itself as the primary point of interest.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a dark door in a dimly lit room, with a light switch and framed pictures on the walls. As the camera moves backward, more of the room becomes visible, including a table with a lamp, a framed picture, and a small decorative item. The camera continues to pull back, revealing a bench with a pair of shoes on the floor next to it. The room is decorated with two framed pictures on the walls, one on the left and one on the right, and a small table with a lamp and other decorative items on the left side.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor scene focused on a closed, dark wooden door featuring a silver doorknob and a peephole, with light seeping around its edges from another area. The surrounding walls are light-colored. To the left of the door, a double light switch is visible. As the camera moves backward, a dark wooden side table comes into view in the lower left, displaying a red patterned object, a small framed photo, and a green bowl, while a shoe rack and a potted plant appears in the lower right corner. On the right wall hangs a larger, vertically oriented framed artwork containing a predominantly red and dark pattern. In the lower right corner, part of a shoe rack can be seen. The overall lighting is quite dim, making it difficult to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
