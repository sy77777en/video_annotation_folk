  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, side-view shot of a minimalist, abstract 2D environment with an off-white background. Initially, a red, bean-shaped character with two short legs and two black dot eyes is positioned in the bottom center, while an orange, rectangular blob-like character with rounded corners, two legs, and round eyes with black dots stands on a small ledge to the left. A large orange staircase structure occupies the left side of the frame, and several orange, bowl-shaped platforms with black hooks underneath hang in the upper right and center-right. On the ground level, three small flowers with pink petals, yellow centers, and green stems are visible. The red character jumps up and extends a limb to grab a black ring on the first platform, swinging into the air to reach another black ring on the second platform before landing on the second yellow platform and making a small jump in place. Meanwhile, the orange character spins and jumps from a high orange step into the air, extending a limb to grab the black ring on the first platform alongside the red character. Together, they swing into the air and reach out to grab the black ring on the second platform. The orange character then jumps to the ground and leaps upward to the right. The camera smoothly side-tracks the two colorful characters as they bounce around the 2D video game level, then zooms out at the end. An instructional text overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"Press X while in the air to catch a hook,\" with the \"X\" depicted as a blue controller button icon.",

    "Subject": "The video features two simple, cartoon-like creatures with atypical appearances. One is a red, bean-shaped character with two short legs and two black dot eyes. The second creature is orange and has a more rectangular, blob-like body with rounded corners, two legs, and round eyes with black dots. Also visible are several flowers, each with six pink petals, six red petals, a yellow center, and a green stem. The scene includes orange, semi-circular platforms, each with a black ring hanging from a small black post underneath.",
    "Motion": "The red character initially jumps up and extends a limb to grab a black ring on the first platform. It then swings into the air, reaching out to grab another black ring on the second platform before landing on the second yellow platform and making a small jump in place. Meanwhile, the yellow character spins and jumps from a high orange step into the air, extending a limb to grab the black ring on the first platform alongside the red character. Together, they swing into the air and reach out to grab the black ring on the second platform. The yellow character then jumps to the ground and leaps upward to the right.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side captures a minimalist, abstract 2D world with an off-white background. The environment is composed of solid orange geometric shapes, including a floor, a staircase-like structure on the left, and various platforms. Several orange, bowl-shaped platforms with black hooks underneath hang from the top of the scene. On the ground level, three small flowers with pink petals and yellow centers are visible. A small red character jumps and swings from one of the hanging hooks to land on a platform, while an orange character moves between ledges. An instructional text overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"Press X while in the air to catch a hook,\" with the \"X\" depicted as a blue controller button icon.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide, side-view shot of a minimalist, abstract 2D environment. Initially, a red character is positioned in the bottom center, with an orange character on a small ledge to the left. A large orange staircase structure occupies the left side of the frame, while orange, bowl-shaped platforms hang in the upper right and center-right. The red character jumps upwards and to the right as the orange character moves to hang from the center-right platform, extending a line that the red character catches. The red character then swings from this line and lands on another hanging platform to the left. The camera tracks the two characters and zooms out at the end of the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
