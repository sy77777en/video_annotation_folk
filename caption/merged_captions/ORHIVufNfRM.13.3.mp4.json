  "merged_caption": "This video presents a first-person perspective moving forward through a dense, underwater, bioluminescent forest. The view is framed by a dark, reddish-orange overlay element, suggesting the perspective of a diver, with a small part of a vehicle's interior visible at the bottom. Tall, trunk-like structures resembling giant mushrooms rise from the sandy seafloor at the bottom of the frame and extend towards the top, populating the middle ground and background to create a sense of depth. These trunks are adorned with large, flat, reddish-pink, mushroom-like caps that have a porous, light-colored underside. Clinging to the sides of these trunks are small, lumpy, bright green organisms that glow intensely, along with small, glowing pink rings. The camera, representing the diver’s first-person perspective, first moves forward and pans right to reveal these tall, mushroom-like underwater structures, then moves leftward and pans left. As the camera advances and pans slightly to the right, some of these structures occasionally pass by the foreground and exit the frame. Initially, some small, glowing blue creatures are visible in the left midground. The two prominent trunks in the center at first, along with the small, glowing green and pink organisms attached to them, shift from the center towards the right side of the frame. As the camera proceeds, a jellyfish-like creature with a glowing blue body and a long tentacle appears in the bottom right of the middle ground. The camera is positioned amidst the trunks, looking straight ahead at the large, reddish-pink caps that occupy the upper half of the frame. The movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and the camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both foreground and background elements sharp. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned underwater, maintaining a level angle throughout the video, although it does roll slightly counter-clockwise midway through.

The movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and the camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both foreground and background elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a first-person perspective of an underwater, bioluminescent forest. The scene is dominated by enormous, dark green, trunk-like structures that rise from the sandy seafloor. These trunks are adorned with large, flat, reddish-pink, mushroom-like caps that have a porous, light-colored underside. Clinging to the sides of these trunks are small, lumpy, bright green organisms that glow intensely. Small, glowing pink rings are attached to the trunks. A small, jellyfish-like creature with a bright, glowing blue body and a long, trailing tentacle swims in the bottom right of the midground. The entire view is framed by a dark, reddish-orange border, suggesting it is seen from inside a helmet or a submersible vehicle.",
    "Motion": "The perspective moves forward, gliding smoothly through a bioluminescent underwater forest populated by large, trunk-like structures. In the bottom right of the scene, a small, jellyfish-like creature with a glowing blue body and a long tentacle swims across. Throughout the scene, schools of floating, glowing fish-like creatures can be seen swimming around the trunks.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater forest with greenish-teal water. The scene is dominated by tall, stalk-like structures resembling giant mushrooms with thick, dark trunks and wide, reddish-pink caps that have a porous texture on their undersides. The mushroom stalks are dotted with glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms and small, pink, glowing rings. A small, jellyfish-like creature with a bright blue, trailing tentacle drifts around the bottom right of the scene. The sandy seabed is a mix of pale sand and patches of dark flora. The view is framed by a reddish-orange overlay element, suggesting the perspective of a diver, with a small part of a vehicle's interior visible at the bottom. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
