  "merged_caption": "In this abstract shot, large, billowy masses of vibrant pink and cyan liquid occupy the upper half of the frame, set against a solid black background. The pink mass is positioned primarily in the top-left and center, while the cyan mass is on the top-right, with both occupying the middle ground. The camera maintains a static, straight-on position, capturing the scene in slow motion with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the billowing pink and cyan ink in the midground. Throughout the scene, the main formations slowly ascend and expand, intermingling and swirling together. As these cloud-like masses drift upwards, the colors mix to create shades of purple where they meet. From these central masses, thicker, viscous tendrils and streams of color flow and drip downwards. Simultaneously, numerous small, distinct droplets of both pink and cyan fall steadily through the dark space, moving towards the bottom of the frame. The substances appear viscous, with thick tendrils and streams dripping downwards, while smaller, distinct droplets of both colors also fall through the scene. The overall composition creates a smoky, ethereal quality as the vibrant liquids interact dynamically against the stark black background.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured with a stationary camera. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the billowing pink and blue ink in the midground.",
    "Subject": "This abstract video features plumes of vibrant pink and cyan liquid suspended and intermingling against a solid black background. The liquids form large, billowy, cloud-like structures, with the pink mass primarily on the upper left and the cyan mass on the right, blending into shades of purple where they meet. The substances appear viscous, with thick tendrils and streams dripping downwards, while smaller, distinct droplets of both colors also fall through the scene.",
    "Motion": "Plumes of pink and cyan liquid slowly ascend and expand, intermingling and swirling together against a black background. As the main cloud-like masses drift upwards, thicker, viscous tendrils and streams of color flow and drip from them. Simultaneously, numerous small droplets of both pink and cyan fall steadily through the fluid.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, vibrant pink and cyan liquids billow and swirl, forming large, cloud-like masses with a smoky, ethereal quality. As these formations slowly ascend, the colors mix to create shades of purple. Thin tendrils and distinct droplets of both pink and cyan drip downward from the main formations, falling through the dark space.",
    "Spatial": "In this abstract shot, large, billowy masses of pink and cyan liquid occupy the upper half of the frame, set against a black background. The pink mass is positioned primarily in the top-left and center, while the cyan mass is on the top-right, with both occupying the middle ground. Throughout the scene, the main formations slowly ascend. From these central masses, viscous tendrils and smaller droplets of both colors drip and fall vertically downwards through the center and foreground, moving towards the bottom of the frame. The camera maintains a static, straight-on position, capturing the downward flow of the liquid as well as the upward ascent of the main cloud-like masses."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
