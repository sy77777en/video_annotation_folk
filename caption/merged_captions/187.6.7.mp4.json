  "merged_caption": "The video commences with a medium close-up of a woman with a dark skin tone, who is slightly left of center in the foreground, against a very dark background, likely indoors at night or in a poorly lit room. Her face is the primary illuminated element, lit from the front left, while the background remains very dark and indistinct, with only a faint, out-of-focus element visible behind her left shoulder. She wears a patterned headscarf featuring blue, white, and possibly red designs, covering her hair, a beige turtleneck top, and a dark jacket. A green and white patterned scarf is tied loosely around her neck. Her dark eyes appear wet, with visible tear streaks running down her cheeks. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the woman in focus. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly zooms in with an unsteady motion, transitioning to a close-up that frames her face more tightly, while exhibiting noticeable shaking. Concurrently, her position shifts to the exact center of the frame in the foreground. During this transition, the woman, initially looking slightly off-camera to her left, subtly shifts her gaze towards the center and then slightly off-camera to her right. White text subtitles appear in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, stating: \"If you have beautiful eyes, you'll see beautiful nightmares.\"",

Her face is partially illuminated from the front left, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. She wears a patterned headscarf featuring blue, white, and possibly red designs, covering her hair. Underneath, she has on a beige turtleneck top and a dark jacket. A green and white patterned scarf is tied loosely around her neck.

    "Scene": "The video presents a close-up shot of a person in an extremely dark, indistinct setting, likely indoors at night or in a poorly lit room. The background is almost entirely black, with only a faint, out-of-focus element visible behind the subject's left shoulder. The person wears a patterned headscarf, primarily cream-colored with blue and possibly red designs, and a light-colored, possibly beige, turtleneck. The lighting is minimal and directional, originating from the front left side of the person, illuminating the left side of the person's face, while the right side remains mostly in shadow. White text subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen, stating: \"If you have beautiful eyes, you'll see beautiful nightmares.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
