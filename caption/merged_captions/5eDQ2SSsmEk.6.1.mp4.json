  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a vintage personal computer screen, which occupies the majority of the frame and is positioned in the middle ground. The device is identified by the \"ATARI\" logo visible at the bottom center of the device, below the screen. The screen displays lines of white text on a black background, scrolling vertically upwards as new lines of code and system information appear from the bottom. The text resembles computer code, with function definitions and the word \"INITIALIZING...\" prominently displayed in the center. Portions of hands holding the device are visible in the middle ground on the far left and right edges of the frame. The background behind the computer is out of focus, showing indistinct warm, golden lights that create a soft bokeh effect. The camera remains static and is positioned at the device's level, maintaining a very smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the computer screen in sharp focus. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly zooms in on the screen, enhancing the focus on the dynamic display. On the screen, lines of code rapidly appear letter by letter and scroll across, while the word \"INITIALIZING...\" remains centered. Other text elements flash and shift around it, simulating a system boot-up sequence.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the computer screen in the midground in sharp focus. The camera slowly zooms in on the screen.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a black, rectangular electronic device, identified as a vintage personal computer by the \"ATARI\" logo visible at the bottom. The device features a small, dark screen that displays glowing white text against a black background. The text on the screen resembles computer code, with function definitions and the word \"INITIALIZING...\" displayed prominently in the center. On the left and right edges of the frame, the fingers and thumbs of a person's hands are visible, holding the device in focus.",
    "Motion": "On the screen of the vintage computer, lines of code rapidly appear letter by letter and scroll across. While the word \"INITIALIZING...\" remains centered, other text elements flash and shift around it, simulating a system boot-up sequence.",
    "Scene": "A close-up shot centers on the monochrome screen of a black vintage computer, which features an \"ATARI\" logo along its bottom edge. The screen displays white text on a black background, showing lines of code and system information that scroll. In the center of the display, the word \"INITIALIZING...\" is prominently visible. The background behind the computer is out of focus, with warm, golden light creating a soft bokeh effect.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot centers on a vintage computer screen, which occupies the majority of the frame and is positioned in the middle ground. On the screen, lines of white text are displayed centrally, scrolling vertically upwards as new lines of code and system information appear from the bottom. Portions of hands holding the device are visible in the middle ground on the far left and right edges of the frame. At the bottom center of the device, below the screen, an \"ATARI\" logo is visible in the middle ground. The background behind the computer is out of focus, showing indistinct warm lights. The camera remains static and is positioned at the device's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
