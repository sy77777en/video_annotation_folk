  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a bustling daytime street scene, likely in Japan, with pedestrians walking along a paved sidewalk next to traditional-style buildings housing shops. On the left side, three men occupy the middle ground, walking towards the background. Two white bicycles are positioned in the center-left middle ground, parked in front of a shop. The shopfront extends across the right half of the frame in the middle ground, adorned with paper lanterns hanging from the top right/center. A woman with long, light brown hair, wearing a tan jacket and black shorts, and another woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a white outfit, are initially on the right side in the foreground, walking towards the right. The woman in the tan jacket, wearing a mask, turns her head to look at a shop display, which showcases various items. She continues to walk forward, glancing at the shop window, and then stops to stand still, closely examining the display. The camera is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly pans from left to right, capturing the scene of people walking and interacting in front of the shop. Trees with autumn leaves are visible in the top left background. The scene captures a lively and casual atmosphere with people engaged in everyday activities, and the buildings feature wooden elements and storefronts with glass display cases. Several paper lanterns, both white with red and black characters and yellow/orange with black characters, hang from the eaves, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The camera remains static at approximately eye level with the subjects throughout the short clip.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
