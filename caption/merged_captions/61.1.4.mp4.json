  "merged_caption": "This is a medium close-up shot focusing on a man with a medium skin tone and a short, neatly trimmed beard, positioned in the right-center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He has closely cropped hair and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt with a collar. The man is seated and facing forward with a serious expression, gesturing with his right hand, holding up his index finger. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the man sharp while softly blurring the background. The background features the blurred back of another person on the left and a red light in the top right center, contributing to a relaxed, informal atmosphere. The environment suggests a cozy, intimate space, possibly a café or a small restaurant, with warm lighting casting soft shadows, indicating an evening or nighttime ambiance. The lighting highlights his facial features, emphasizing his focused demeanor. Initially, the man looks straight ahead with a serious expression. He then changes his expression to include squinted eyes and furrowed brows, smiling slightly as he tilts his head to the side. While doing so, he brings his index finger to his mouth, appearing thoughtful and engaged in the moment. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level, but it is slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
