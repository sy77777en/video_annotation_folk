  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the subject's lower body extends from the bottom center foreground to the middle ground, wearing dark patterned pants and blue flip-flops. A bowl containing gray, wet cement is positioned in the center left middle ground. Adjacent to the bowl, a partially constructed red brick wall extends from the top left middle ground downwards. Several loose red bricks, with one imprinted with visible text, are scattered in the center right middle ground initially, but later exit the frame. Concrete steps are initially at the top and then shift to the top right corner in the middle ground. Greenery occupies the background, primarily on the left side below the wall. Initially, the subject's left hand holds a brick in the bottom left foreground, while the right hand, holding a brick, is in the bottom right foreground. The video is shot from a head-mounted camera perspective at eye level, focusing on a person handling bricks. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. As the person, wearing a light-colored shirt, walks on the concrete surface, possibly a staircase, they move forward and slightly to the left towards the partially constructed brick wall, raising the brick in their left hand using only their forearm. The camera mirrors this movement and rolls counterclockwise, enhancing the dynamic perspective with noticeable shaking throughout, indicating unsteady camera movement. The ground is covered with broken bricks and construction debris, and there is a container with cement nearby. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby, and the time of day is likely midday, indicated by the bright lighting and shadows. The scene suggests an active construction site with visible progress and materials in use.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from a bird's-eye view at eye level, focusing on a person handling bricks. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. As the person moves forward and slightly to the left, the camera mirrors this movement and rolls counterclockwise, enhancing the dynamic perspective with noticeable shaking throughout, indicating unsteady camera movement.",
    "Subject": "The video is shot from a head-mounted camera perspective, featuring a person engaged in construction work. The individual, whose skin tone is medium, is wearing dark patterned pants , blue flip-flops and a light-colored shirt. They are holding bricks, one in each hand, with visible text imprinted on one of the bricks. The scene includes a partially constructed brick wall and a container with cement. The person appears to be standing on a concrete surface, possibly a staircase, with scattered bricks and construction materials around them. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby. ",
    "Motion": "The video shows a person walking on a construction site, holding two bricks, one in each hand. The person is wearing a light-colored shirt and dark patterned pants, and is seen moving towards a partially constructed brick wall. The ground is covered with broken bricks and construction debris, and there is a container with cement nearby. As the person walks, they raise the brick in their left hand using only their forearm. The background includes some greenery and rocks.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor construction setting. The scene features a partially built brick wall on a concrete surface, with scattered red bricks and a container of wet cement nearby. The environment includes a mix of natural and constructed elements, with greenery visible beyond the construction area. The time of day is likely midday, indicated by the bright lighting and shadows. The bricks are red with a rough texture, and the cement appears gray and wet. The setting suggests an active construction site with visible progress and materials in use.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
