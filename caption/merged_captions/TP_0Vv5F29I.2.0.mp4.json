  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, frames a man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants as he performs a bicycle stunt on a moving train, remaining in the center of the frame. The cyclist is positioned on a blue ramp located above the train, which extends across the middle ground and occupies the lower portion of the frame. The train moves straight to the left on tracks beside a lush cornfield under a clear blue sky. The cyclist rides up the blue ramp, which features a red \"Red Bull\" logo, launching into the air and lifting the front wheel of the bicycle. While airborne, he moves in an arc and lands on top of a large blue shipping container on another train car, marked with a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in large white letters. He then completes a downhill jump on a stepped ramp. A cornfield is visible in the background on the left, while a green combine harvester is located behind the train in the background on the right. The ground surrounding the tracks is dirt and grass. The camera, from a smooth, eye-level, and level perspective, trucks from side to side, tracking the cyclist as he performs stunts on the train. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. On each side of the train, there is a red-and-white railroad crossing sign.",

    "Subject": "A man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs a stunt on a black bicycle. He rides up a blue ramp, which is mounted on a flatbed train car and features a Red Bull logo, launching into the air. He lands on top of an adjacent large, blue shipping container, also on a train car, which has a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in large white letters. A green combine harvester is visible in the background behind the train.",

    "Scene": "Set in a rural landscape under a clear blue sky, a train moves straight to the left on tracks beside a lush cornfield. The train is composed of flatbed cars, one of which is fitted with a blue ramp featuring a red \"Red Bull\" logo. A cyclist rides up this ramp and jumps onto an adjacent large, blue shipping container marked with a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in white. On each side of the train, there is a red-and-white railroad crossing sign. Behind the train, on the left, is the cornfield, and on the right is a green combine harvester. The ground surrounding the tracks is dirt and grass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
