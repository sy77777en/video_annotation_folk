  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted sailboat with a figure inside is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The boat floats on a calm body of water that extends from the foreground to the middle ground, enveloped in thick fog in the middle ground and background. A beam of light extends from the top center toward the bottom left, cutting through the dense fog. A dark, blurry vignette overlays the edges of the frame, and a black, blurry, rock-like object is visible at the bottom of the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and smoothly tracks a figure in a boat from the side, moving rightward to follow its movement. The sailboat gently moves forward and to the right of the frame, while the black silhouette of a small, child-like figure on the boat occasionally blinks and sways slightly. The entire presentation of the figure and the boat is in a stark, desaturated, black-and-white style, with soft, blurry edges. The scene unfolds in a monochromatic, black-and-white style on a vast, calm body of water shrouded in thick, white fog. A dark silhouette of a small sailboat with a single mast is positioned in the center, floating on the water with a silhouetted figure inside.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the camera smoothly tracks a figure in a boat from the side, moving rightward to follow its movement.",
    "Subject": "A black silhouette of a small, child-like figure with a round head and a slender body is depicted sitting inside a small sailboat. The boat is also rendered as a black silhouette, featuring a simple hull and a single, thin mast. The entire presentation of the figure and the boat is in a stark, desaturated, black-and-white style, with soft, blurry edges.",
    "Motion": "The sailboat gently moves forward and to the right of the frame, while the black silhouette of a small, child-like figure on the boat occasionally blinks and sways slightly.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video, a scene unfolds in a monochromatic, black-and-white style on a vast, calm body of water shrouded in thick, white fog. A dark silhouette of a small sailboat with a single mast is positioned in the center, floating on the water with a silhouetted figure inside. A soft beam of light shines down from the top center, extending towards the bottom left, cutting through the dense fog. The entire scene is framed by a dark, blurry vignette, focusing the view on the central boat.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted sailboat with a figure inside is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
