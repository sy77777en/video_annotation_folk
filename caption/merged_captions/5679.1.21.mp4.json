  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two subjects: a large, fluffy dog with a light cream coat and a person wearing a bright blue jacket, light blue pants, and a light green beanie, both lying on their backs on a grassy surface. The dog occupies the left side of the frame, while the person is positioned to the right, parallel to the dog. Both are in the foreground, with no significant background elements visible. The dog lies on its back with its legs bent at the knees, and the person mirrors this pose with hands behind their head, looking relaxed. The camera is positioned directly above them, capturing the entire length of both subjects from a bird's-eye view. The grassy surface, scattered with small brown leaves, forms the immediate background, extending uniformly across the frame. The camera maintains a steady overhead angle, emphasizing the subjects' positions and the harmony between them. The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting featuring a lush green lawn, indicating a natural environment. The time of day is likely midday, as the lighting is bright and even. The camera is positioned at a second-floor height and moves smoothly upward, maintaining a steady shot. The scene is static, with no visible motion or weather changes. The background consists of green grass with scattered autumn leaves, adding a touch of seasonal color to the scene. The framing remains consistent, maintaining the parallel arrangement of the dog and person. The camera's deep focus captures the entire scene, emphasizing the peaceful and harmonious arrangement of the subjects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
