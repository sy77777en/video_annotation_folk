  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a worm's-eye view, where a tall building occupies the right side of the frame. Shortly after the video begins, the top of another building appears in the bottom left, framing a clear sky. As the video progresses, clouds cover the initially clear sky, resulting in a bright, cloudy sky that fills the center and left portions of the scene. The camera, initially pointed upward at the sky, performs a smooth, quick downward tilt to an eye-level, level-angle perspective, revealing a narrow city street. In this new frame, a silver Toyota Corolla hatchback with the license plate \"EN55 CLU\" is positioned in the lower-center of the foreground, viewed from the rear, with another silver minivan to its left. The street is lined with parked cars and tall, brick buildings, with some green trees visible, and a \"20\" speed limit marking is painted on the asphalt. The street extends from the foreground and is obscured by the cars, flanked by tall buildings on the left and right that create depth. The entire scene then begins to move rapidly forward from a position at the subject's level, following the rear of the stationary silver hatchback parked on the right side of the road. This motion causes the buildings on the sides to blur with motion. A logo overlay remains consistently visible in the bottom right corner of the frame, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This shot begins with a smooth, quick camera movement from a worm's-eye view of the sky and buildings. The camera tilts down to an eye-level, level-angle perspective and then moves forward rapidly down a street. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with an upward-facing view of a clear sky above a multi-story building. Later, the top of another multi-story building appears in the bottom left, and the sky becomes cloudy before the camera tilts downward, revealing a silver Toyota Corolla hatchback with the license plate \"EN55 CLU.\" The car is parked on the right side of a narrow city street and is viewed from the rear. To the left of the parked Toyota, a silver minivan is seen stationary.",
    "Motion": "The camera, initially pointed upward at the sky, performs a downward tilt, revealing a narrow city street. It comes to a view of the rear of a stationary silver hatchback parked on the right side of the road. To the left, another silver vehicle is also stationary. The camera then moves quickly forward toward the hatchback.",
    "Scene": "The scene opens with a worm's-eye view of multi-story buildings against a bright sky, initially clear, then quickly covered by a large cloud for effect. The top of another building appears in the bottom left before the clouds appear, and the camera tilts down to show the street. The perspective then transitions to a rapidly moving forward shot down a narrow city street, following the rear of a silver Toyota Corolla. The street is lined with parked cars and tall, brick buildings, with some green trees visible. A \"20\" speed limit marking is painted on the asphalt. A logo overlay is consistently visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a worm's-eye view, where a tall building occupies the right side of the frame. Shortly after the video begins, the top of another building appears in the bottom left, framing a clear sky. As the video progresses, clouds cover the initially clear sky, resulting in a bright, cloudy sky that fills the center and left portions of the scene. The camera then tilts downward, revealing a street-level perspective and transitioning to a wide shot. In this new frame, a silver car is positioned in the lower-center of the foreground, with another car to its left. The street extends from the foreground and is obscured by the cars, flanked by tall buildings on the left and right that create depth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
