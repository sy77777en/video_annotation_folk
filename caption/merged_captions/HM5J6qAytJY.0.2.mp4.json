  "merged_caption": "This video is presented as a first-person point-of-view shot from the driver's seat of a race car. In the immediate foreground, the driver's arms, clad in a white racing suit and white gloves with black accents, are visible holding a black, yoke-style racing steering wheel with a silver Mercedes-Benz logo at its center, equipped with numerous multi-colored buttons and dials. A white roll cage is visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners. The car's dashboard and a central digital display showing vehicle data occupy the middle ground, just above the steering wheel. Through the windshield, a paved road extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked by a flat, arid desert landscape in the middle ground. In the background, mountains are visible on the horizon under a clear sky, with the sun positioned in the top left of the frame, casting a warm, golden light as it hangs low. The entire car moves forward, causing the exterior scenery to rush from the background toward the foreground. The driver navigates a straight track, making slight adjustments to the steering wheel. As the car approaches a curve, the driver noticeably turns the steering wheel to the left, with the desert landscape passing by. The camera is positioned at the driver's eye level, capturing the driver's hands on the steering wheel as it moves continuously forward. This is a slightly unsteady, eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, and there is barrel distortion present. At the end of the shot, the camera pans and trucks slightly to the left, maintaining the immersive first-person perspective as the scene evolves.",

    "Subject": "This video shows a first-person perspective from inside a race car, looking out the front windshield. A person's arms, clad in a white racing suit and white gloves with black accents, are visible holding a black, yoke-style racing steering wheel. The steering wheel has a silver Mercedes-Benz logo at its center and is equipped with numerous multi-colored buttons and dials. The car's interior is stripped down, featuring a white structural roll cage with crisscrossing bars on both the left and right sides. A small digital display screen, showing vehicle data, is mounted on the dashboard in the center. Through the windshield, a paved road stretches forward through a flat, arid landscape with mountains visible in the distance under a clear sky, illuminated by the golden light of a sun low on the horizon.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the view from inside a race car driving on a paved track through a desert landscape at sunset. The interior of the car features a white, crisscrossing roll cage, and a driver's hands in white gloves are visible on a complex racing steering wheel with a Mercedes-Benz logo. A digital dashboard is mounted in the center of the console. Through the windshield, the sun hangs low on the horizon, casting a warm light over the flat, arid terrain and distant mountains as the car moves forward.",
    "Spatial": "This video is presented as a first-person point-of-view shot from the driver's seat of a race car. In the immediate foreground, the driver's hands and a steering wheel are centered in the bottom half of the frame. A white roll cage is visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners, also in the foreground. The car's dashboard and a central digital display occupy the middle ground, just above the steering wheel. Through the windshield, a road extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked by a desert landscape in the middle ground. In the background, mountains are visible on the horizon, with the sun positioned in the top left of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
