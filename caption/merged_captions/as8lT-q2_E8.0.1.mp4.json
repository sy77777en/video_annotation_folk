  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a full shot, as the camera gradually moves forward with a slight shakiness, transitioning into a medium shot as the action intensifies. Two silhouetted figures, seemingly in suits or similar formal attire, are positioned in the center foreground, engaged in a fight. The figure on the left initially holds an object resembling a gun. As they struggle, the figure on the left fires a shot before being disarmed by the figure on the right, who kicks the gun away. The left figure then elbows the right figure, who responds by kicking the left figure to take the gun. They continue to grapple, moving towards the left side of the frame. Behind them, in the center middle ground, a large screen displays a dark blue screen with small white dots resembling stars. Gradually, a large, glowing, light-blue jellyfish graphic with intricate, web-like tendrils emerges from the bottom to the center of the screen, rising to occupy the center middle ground. Elements of a city skyline are visible in the right background, illuminated against the night sky. The figures remain primarily in the center foreground, shifting slightly left and right as they grapple, with one figure briefly moving to a lower position before rising. The camera is positioned level with the subjects, capturing the dynamic struggle against the bright, dynamic display. Through adjacent windows on the right, parts of a modern city skyline are visible, illuminated against the night sky.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at eye level, capturing a full shot with deep focus on the fighting silhouettes and background. It then moves forward slowly, transitioning to a medium shot by the end, with a slightly unsteady, shaky motion.",
    "Subject": "The video depicts the silhouettes of two men engaged in a physical fight, with the individual on the left holding a gun. Both figures are dark against a brightly lit blue background that appears to be made of glass, displaying stars and later a large jellyfish graphic that gradually emerges from below. The men, seemingly in suits or similar formal attire, grapple and exchange blows. The person on the left fires the gun, but the person on the right manages to force it to the ground and kicks it away. Eventually, one man crouches while the other delivers a kick.",
    "Motion": "Two silhouettes grapple, with the figure on the left initially holding an object resembling a gun. As they struggle, the figure on the left fires a shot before being disarmed by the figure on the right. The left figure then elbows the right figure, who responds by kicking the left figure to take the gun. They continue to grapple, moving towards the left side of the frame. Meanwhile, a large jellyfish graphic gradually rises from below behind them.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors at night, within a room dominated by a large, illuminated screen or window. This screen initially shows a dark blue background with small white dots resembling stars. Gradually, a large, glowing, light-blue jellyfish graphic with intricate, web-like tendrils emerges from the bottom to the center of the screen. In front of the glass, two silhouetted figures are engaged in a struggle at the center of the scene, which is a key focus against the bright, dynamic display. Through adjacent windows on the right, parts of a modern city skyline are visible, illuminated against the night sky.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a full shot, as the camera gradually moves forward with a slight shakiness, transitioning into a medium shot as the action intensifies.

Concurrently, a large jellyfish graphic emerges from the bottom of the screen, rising to occupy the center middle ground. The camera is positioned level with the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
