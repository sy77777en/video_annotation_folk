  "merged_caption": "This wide shot opens with a dark-colored convertible limousine with whitewall tires positioned in the center middle ground, moving from left to right at a steady pace across a paved area. Inside the car, its occupants are centrally located in the middle ground. In the back seat, a man with brown hair wearing a dark suit, identified as John F. Kennedy, smiles and waves toward the side. Next to him sit two men in dark suits. In the second row of the convertible, a man in a white military uniform with a peaked cap is seated, and another man in a dark suit is next to him. The driver of the car is wearing a gray suit. An American flag is mounted on the front right fender of the vehicle, and another dark flag is on the driver's side. In the background, a large, nondescript building spans the top of the frame, with a crowd of people and numerous parked cars on the right and a person walking on the far left. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans smoothly to the right, tracking the limousine as it drives past, causing the background to blur with motion and the framing to tighten into a full shot that keeps the limousine and its passengers as the central focus. As the camera follows the car, the vehicle becomes larger in the frame. The flags mounted on the front fenders of the car flutter as it moves forward. The footage has a grainy quality characteristic of older color film, and the low resolution makes it difficult to determine the camera's focus.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot taken from a level angle. The camera pans to the right, tracking a dark convertible limousine as it drives past. As the camera follows the car, the vehicle becomes larger in the frame. The footage is too low-resolution to determine the camera's focus.",
    "Subject": "A dark-colored convertible limousine with whitewall tires is shown carrying several light-skinned men. An American flag is mounted on the front passenger-side fender, and another dark flag is on the driver's side. In the back seat, a man with brown hair wearing a dark suit, identified as John F. Kennedy, smiles and waves. Next to him sit two men in dark suits. In the second row of the convertible, a man in a white military uniform with a peaked cap is seated, and another man in a dark suit is next to him. The driver of the car is wearing a gray suit.",
    "Motion": "A dark convertible limousine drives from left to right at a steady pace. A man in the back seat smiles and waves toward the side. The flags mounted on the front fenders of the car flutter as it moves forward.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime, outdoor scene, a dark-colored convertible limousine with whitewall tires moves from left to right across a paved area. An American flag is mounted on the front right fender of the vehicle. In the background, a crowd of people and numerous parked cars are visible in front of a large, nondescript building. The camera pans to follow the car, causing the background to appear blurred with motion. The footage has a grainy quality characteristic of older color film.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
