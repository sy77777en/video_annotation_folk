  "merged_caption": "This video features a close-up shot of vibrant red maple leaves with intricate, pointed shapes, positioned in the center and right upper portion of the frame, occupying the foreground. The leaves gently sway back and forth, creating a dynamic element against the softly blurred background of green and brown forest elements, primarily on the right and left portions of the frame. The background is a mix of green and yellow foliage, indicating a lush, green forest or park setting during the daytime. The camera is at approximately the same height as the leaves, capturing them at eye level with a level camera angle and a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, with no significant movement or change in shot size. The depth is emphasized by the sharp focus on the foreground leaves and the blurred background, creating a clear separation between the two planes. Light filters through the leaves, highlighting their vivid color and smooth texture, and the serene and immersive experience emphasizes the beauty and tranquility of the natural setting. The calm and peaceful atmosphere is undisturbed by weather, and the focus on the leaves suggests a close-up view, emphasizing the natural beauty and detail of the foliage within the broader forest setting.",

    "Camera": "The video features a level camera angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. The camera remains completely static.",
    "Subject": "The video is a close-up shot of vibrant red maple leaves with intricate, pointed shapes, gently swaying in the wind. Set against a softly blurred background of green and brown hues, the focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the contrast and harmony of colors. This creates a serene and immersive experience, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the natural setting.",
    "Motion": "A branch with vibrant red leaves is seen in the foreground, gently swaying back and forth. The background is a blurred mix of green and yellow foliage, indicating a forest or park setting.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a lush, green forest during the daytime. The scene features vibrant red maple leaves in the foreground, their pointed, delicate shapes contrasting against the blurred background of green foliage and tree trunks. The leaves exhibit a smooth texture, with some light filtering through, highlighting their vivid color.  Leaves in both the foreground and background gently sway in the breeze, adding a dynamic element to the serene natural environment. The calm and peaceful atmosphere is undisturbed by weather, and the focus on the leaves suggests a close-up view, emphasizing the natural beauty and detail of the foliage within the broader forest setting.",
    "Spatial": "This video features a close-up shot of the scenery, highlighting a cluster of red maple leaves. The leaves are positioned in the center and right upper portion of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the softly blurred green and brown forest elements fill the background, primarily on the right and left portions of the frame. The camera is at approximately the same height as the leaves, capturing them at eye level. Throughout the video, the leaves gently sway in place, but their spatial position within the frame remains consistent, with no significant camera movement or change in shot size. The depth is emphasized by the sharp focus on the foreground leaves and the blurred background, creating a clear separation between the two planes."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
