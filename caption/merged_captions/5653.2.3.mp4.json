  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a Black woman with brown skin, positioned centrally within the frame. She has dark, shoulder-length wavy hair and is wearing a black strapless top, with a small gold hoop earring visible in her right ear. Her makeup includes dark eyeliner and glossy lipstick. Her head is tilted to her right, and her eyes are closed, suggesting a moment of calm or introspection. A streak of moisture is visible on her left cheek. The scene is set indoors with a dimly lit environment, creating a subdued and intimate atmosphere. The background is dark and indistinct, emphasizing her presence in the foreground. The lighting softly highlights her facial features, emphasizing the smooth texture of her skin and the subtle sheen on her lips, while the overall color palette is warm and muted, with her attire blending seamlessly into the low-light setting. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the woman using a very shallow depth of field. Throughout the video, her upper body remains mostly still, with only slight head movements, primarily tilting towards her right shoulder. The camera moves backward while subtly zooming in, enhancing the focus on the subject without any shaking or distraction. There are no significant changes in shot size or position throughout the scene, maintaining focus on her serene expression and the subtle details of her appearance. The focus remains on the subject, with no other visible elements or distractions in the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
