  "merged_caption": "The video displays an extreme close-up shot of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations, featuring a yellowed, aged appearance and a slightly crumpled texture. The paper occupies the center of the frame, with its 2D position remaining central from start to finish, and is in the foreground with no other elements in the middle ground or background. The camera is positioned above the paper, providing a top-down view with a high-angle perspective and an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where handwritten numbers and arithmetic operations are visible. The shot size remains consistent throughout, capturing the entire paper within the frame. The camera smoothly tilts down and pans left, starting from the top left and moving towards the bottom right, revealing different sections of the handwritten content, including numbers like \"82,000\" and \"87,000,\" suggesting a financial or quantitative context. The calculations are organized in columns, with some figures underlined for emphasis. The lighting is warm, casting soft shadows that highlight the paper's creases and the boldness of the dark ink handwriting. The focus remains sharp on the paper's surface, emphasizing the details of the handwriting and the paper's texture. The camera movement allows viewers to see various parts of the paper, with the focus remaining on the numerical values and the calculations as the camera continues to tilt down. The setting is indoors, with no additional elements visible, ensuring the viewer's attention is entirely on the paper's surface and the calculations it bears. There are no changes in the camera's height relative to the paper during the sequence.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle view with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where handwritten numbers on a paper are visible. The camera smoothly tilts down and pans left, maintaining focus on the paper's content.",
    "Subject": "The video features a close-up view of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The paper has a yellowed, aged appearance, suggesting it might be old or frequently handled. The handwriting is in dark ink, with numbers and arithmetic operations prominently displayed. The calculations are organized in columns, with some numbers underlined for emphasis. The paper's surface shows slight creases and shadows, indicating it is not perfectly flat. The focus is on the numerical values, with figures like \"82,000\" and \"87,000\" clearly visible, suggesting a financial or quantitative context.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a piece of paper containing handwritten calculations. The camera smoothly tilts down and pans left, revealing more of the paper and the calculations written on it. The calculations include various numbers and arithmetic operations, with some figures underlined for emphasis. The paper appears to be old, with a yellowed, aged appearance, and the handwriting is in dark ink. The focus remains on the numerical values and the calculations as the camera continues to tilt down.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a close-up view of a weathered piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The paper, with a yellowed and slightly crumpled texture, features numbers and symbols written in dark ink. The lighting is warm, casting soft shadows that highlight the paper's creases and the boldness of the ink. The setting is indoors, with no additional elements visible, focusing entirely on the paper's surface and the calculations it bears. The camera subtly pans downward, revealing additional content written on the paper, while emphasizing the details of the handwriting and the paper's aged appearance.",
    "Spatial": "The video displays an extreme close-up shot of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The shot size remains consistent throughout, capturing the entire paper within the frame. The paper occupies the center of the frame, with its 2D position remaining central from start to finish. In 3D space, the paper is in the foreground, with no other elements in the middle ground or background. The camera slowly pans across the paper, starting from the top left and moving towards the bottom right, revealing different sections of the handwritten content. This movement allows viewers to see various parts of the paper, including the numbers and arithmetic operations. The camera appears to be positioned above the paper, providing a top-down view. There are no changes in the camera's height relative to the paper during the sequence. The focus remains sharp on the paper's surface, highlighting the details of the handwriting and the paper's texture."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
