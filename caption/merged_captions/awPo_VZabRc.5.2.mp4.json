  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot from a high, top-down perspective, an animated character with dark hair lies motionless in the center of the frame on the pavement of a narrow, dark alley between two tall, gray buildings at night. The character is dressed in a dark, long coat with a high, pointed collar over a white shirt, and the coat is spread out on the ground around them, creating a shape reminiscent of bat wings. A fire hydrant is positioned in the top right of the frame. The scene is enclosed by a building on the left side, which features simple rectangular windows and a fire escape, all with a stylized, hand-drawn appearance with visible line work. White streaks, representing heavy rain, begin to appear and move rapidly downwards through the frame, creating a sense of fast downward motion past the stationary character and the adjacent building. The character and fire hydrant appear stationary relative to each other, but due to the camera's smooth clockwise rotation, the fire hydrant shifts from the upper right-center position to the upper center of the frame. Simultaneously, the camera ascends away from the character on the ground, creating a disorienting, rising effect.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial, bird's-eye perspective looking down into an alley, the camera smoothly rolls clockwise while simultaneously ascending away from a character on the ground. This creates a disorienting, rising effect.",
    "Subject": "From a high, top-down perspective, an animated character with dark hair is seen lying on their side. The character is dressed in a dark, long coat with a high, pointed collar over a white shirt. The coat is spread out on the ground around them, creating a shape reminiscent of bat wings. A smaller, less distinct figure is bear the charcter, which is actually a fire hydrant.",
    "Motion": "From a high, top-down perspective, an animated character lies motionless on the ground in an alley. White streaks, resembling rain, begin to appear, moving rapidly downward past the stationary character and the adjacent building, creating the visual effect of a fast descent.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows a high-angle, top-down view of a narrow, dark alley between two tall, gray buildings at night. The buildings, which feature simple rectangular windows and a fire escape on one side, have a stylized, hand-drawn appearance with visible line work. White streaks, representing heavy rain, fall rapidly through the scene, creating a sense of fast downward motion. On the dark pavement below, a figure is lying down.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot from a high, top-down perspective, an animated character lies in the center of the frame on the pavement. A fire hydrant is positioned in the top right of the frame. The scene is enclosed by a building on the left side. White streaks representing rain begin to appear and move rapidly downwards through the frame. The character and fire hydrant appear stationary relative to each other, but due to the camera's clockwise rotation, the fire hydrant shifts from the upper right-center position to the upper center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
