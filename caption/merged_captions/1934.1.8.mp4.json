  "merged_caption": "This medium-full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, features a large, white, camera-like machine occupying the center of the frame in the foreground. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the large white camera prop and the person behind it in sharp focus. To the right side of the frame, a person in a white suit stands in the middle ground. The man in the white suit and the large, white, camera-like machine remain mostly stationary throughout the video, although the man raises his hands to adjust the white goggles from his forehead to his eyes. The scene is set against a uniform white background. The large, white, camera-like machine has a rectangular body with a large, dark, circular lens recessed in the center, a smaller secondary lens on a cylindrical mount to the top left, and a small, square viewfinder to the top right. The man, wearing a tight-fitting white suit with two black dots on the chest and a third dot on his skullcap, stands with his hands initially near a silver-colored crank attached to the camera's side. He wears white gloves and a white skullcap with white goggles pushed up on his forehead, revealing a face with orange makeup, pronounced white eyebrows, and an open mouth. The stark, all-white room creates a minimalist and stylized environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the large white camera prop and the person behind it in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A large, white, camera-like machine with a rectangular body is positioned centrally. It features a large, dark, circular lens recessed in the center, a smaller secondary lens on a cylindrical mount to the top left, and a small, square viewfinder to the top right. On the right side of the frame stands a man in a medium-full body view, wearing a tight-fitting white suit with two black dots on the chest and a third dot on his skullcap. He wears white gloves and a white skullcap with white goggles pushed up on his forehead, revealing a face with orange makeup, pronounced white eyebrows, and an open mouth. He is raising his hand to move the white goggles from his forehead to his eyes.",

    "Scene": "In a stark, all-white room, a large, box-shaped white camera is mounted on a pedestal. The camera features a prominent, dark central lens, a smaller secondary lens on the left side of the screen, and a square viewfinder at the top right of the frame. To the right, a person in a white, full-body suit, complete with white gloves and goggles, stands with their hands initially near a silver-colored crank attached to the camera's side. The person then raises their hands to adjust their goggles from their forehead to their eyes. Their face is painted with orange makeup, and the background is a uniform white, creating a minimalist and stylized environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
