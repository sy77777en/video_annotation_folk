  "merged_caption": "This scenery video begins with a wide shot of the Basilica of Santa Croce, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, viewed from a low angle looking up. A clear blue sky occupies the top of the frame in the background. In the middle ground to the left, other buildings with yellow facades and a statue are visible. People are scattered across the foreground at the bottom of the frame, on the steps and in the square. The camera moves smoothly forward and trucks left with a slight right pan as it advances toward the basilica, capturing the intricate details of the Italian Gothic architecture, including the white and green marble patterns, the large circular window, and the sculptures adorning the entrance. The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping the entire building sharp against the sky. The video culminates in a final zoom-in effect that brings the main portal, the circular window, and the upper pediment to dominate the frame, while the people in the foreground and the buildings on the far left are partially cropped out. The ornate facade of the basilica features geometric patterns of white and green marble, pointed arches, numerous spires, and a prominent blue Star of David set within the main gable. The focus is on capturing the atmosphere and impressive scale of the building, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than any specific person or object within it. The sunlit outdoor square in Florence, Italy, enhances the grandeur and architectural splendor of the location, immersing the viewer in the scene's magnificence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
