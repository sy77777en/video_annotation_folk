  "merged_caption": "This is an aerial video featuring dynamic wide shots of a sprawling, historic European-style city from a high-angle perspective. The scene is dominated by a thick layer of fog that occupies the foreground and middle ground, covering the bottom and left portions of the frame. In the middle ground and background, clusters of tightly packed buildings with red-tiled roofs and light-colored facades emerge through the fog, positioned primarily in the top right, center-right, and top left of the frame. The soft, warm light suggests either dawn or dusk, illuminating the architectural details that emerge from the ethereal mist. The camera moves smoothly throughout the clip, providing a sweeping high-angle view over the cityscape. From a smooth, aerial high-angle perspective, the camera slowly moves forward over the city partially covered in fog. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. A dense layer of fog or low-lying clouds partially obscures the buildings below, with the red-tiled roofs of the city visible through breaks in the mist. The high-angle perspective and the vast, fog-laden view direct the focus to the grand scale of the city and the dramatic interplay between the urban landscape and the natural elements. A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective over the city during the early morning, with a thick blanket of white and grey fog covering much of the landscape. The visible structures are densely packed, featuring red-tiled, sloped roofs and light-colored walls. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall environment and mood, capturing the atmospheric interplay between the city and the natural elements.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective over a city during the early morning.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
