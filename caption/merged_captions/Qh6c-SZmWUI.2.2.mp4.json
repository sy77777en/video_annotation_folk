  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot that begins inside a building at eye level, with the camera at a level angle. The scene starts as a wide shot from within a dark, narrow passageway, with the camera moving backward. An arched opening, centered in the frame, frames the sunlit exterior. As the camera moves backward, the passageway becomes more visible, revealing a person inside. The camera continues to pull back, showing the passageway from a wider perspective, and the surrounding stone walls and greenery start to come into view. The camera rapidly pulls back through the opening, transitioning the view into an extreme wide shot. During this smooth backward flight, the camera gently rolls clockwise, creating a dynamic effect with a slight Dutch angle. In this final composition, a large, ivy-covered stone building on a cliff occupies the center. The ocean is visible in the left background, while dense green foliage fills the foreground and right side of the frame. The camera continues to move backward and slightly upward, revealing the full scale of the cliffside structure, positioning the camera at an aerial height. The setting shifts to a coastal landscape featuring a historic stone building perched on a cliff, partially covered in lush green ivy, with a terracotta roof contrasting against the clear blue sky. The surrounding area includes dense vegetation and a view of the ocean, with sunlight casting sharp shadows that highlight the natural textures of the stone and foliage. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear weather and scattered clouds enhancing the vibrant colors of the scene. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The video begins inside a building at eye level, with the camera at a level angle. As the drone camera moves backward and exits, it transitions to an aerial level, revealing a large building on a mountain near the ocean. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. During the smooth backward flight, it gently rolls clockwise, creating a dynamic effect with a slight Dutch angle. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases an impressive drone shot that enhances the epic quality of the landscape scenery. It begins with a backward flight through a dark, narrow passageway, seamlessly transitioning to an illuminated exit. This smooth movement suggests a journey or discovery, leading to a bright, expansive view of a cliffside adorned with a building covered in lush greenery. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the contrast between the enclosed, shadowy tunnel and the open, vibrant landscape, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural surroundings.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a dark passageway leading to a brighter area at the end. As the camera moves backward, the passageway becomes more visible, revealing a person inside. The camera continues to pull back, showing the passageway from a wider perspective, and the surrounding stone walls and greenery start to come into view. The camera moves further back, revealing a more expansive view of the stone building with ivy-covered walls and multiple windows. The building is situated on a cliff, with the sea visible on the left side and more greenery on the right. The camera continues to pull back, providing a broader view of the cliffside building and its surroundings, including the coastline and distant landscape.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, begins by flying backward through a dimly lit, narrow tunnel with an arched entrance, gradually revealing more detail in the stone walls and floor. As the drone exits the tunnel, a vibrant glimpse of greenery emerges, transitioning to a bright, expansive outdoor scene. The setting shifts to a coastal landscape featuring a historic stone building perched on a cliff, partially covered in lush green ivy, with a terracotta roof contrasting against the clear blue sky. The surrounding area includes dense vegetation and a view of the ocean, with sunlight casting sharp shadows that highlight the natural textures of the stone and foliage. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear weather and scattered clouds enhancing the vibrant colors of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
