  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, filmed from a slightly elevated perspective, a white goat initially stands on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, positioned on a black metal ramp with its back to the camera, and eventually shifts to the center of the frame. To its right, a smaller brown and white goat, appearing to be pregnant, is in the middle ground, walking leftward on the concrete floor below. Due to camera movements, it appears to move from the center of the frame toward the right. Initially, the ramp extends from the bottom-left foreground into the middle ground, but it shifts to the center-left by the end, due to the camera movement. A wooden shelving unit with black fabric bins and a white metal canister is positioned in the center-right middle ground, while a large wooden box occupies the left middle ground. The entire scene is enclosed by a fence visible on the right and the upper portion in the middle ground, with trees and a yard with playground equipment in the distant background. As the video progresses, the camera, from a high-angle, eye-level perspective, performs a quick, brief pan to the left to follow the goats before pausing, bringing more of the wooden box on the left into view while the brown goat continues its movement. The scene takes place during the day within an outdoor, fenced enclosure that has a concrete floor. Dry, yellow leaves are scattered outside the right edge of the fence, enhancing the natural ambiance of the scene. A small wooden stool is also present. The camera captures the scene with deep focus, keeping both the goats and their surroundings sharp, as the white goat remains mostly stationary on the black metal platform.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, eye-level perspective, this slightly unsteady shot captures the scene with deep focus, keeping both the goats and their surroundings sharp. The camera performs a quick, brief pan to the left to follow the goats before pausing.",
    "Subject": "In an outdoor enclosure, two goats are visible. One goat, which is predominantly white with some black markings on its rear and tail, stands on a black metal ramp with its back to the camera. To its right, a smaller goat with brown and white fur stands on the concrete ground, appearing to be pregnant.",
    "Motion": "A white goat remains mostly stationary on a black metal platform, while a smaller brown and white goat walks on the concrete floor below. The smaller goat turns and moves leftward, with its position shifting from the center to the right of the frame due to camera movement.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place during the day within an outdoor, fenced enclosure that has a concrete floor. Dry, yellow leaves are scattered outside the right edge of the fence, enhancing the natural ambiance of the scene. In the background, beyond a chain-link fence, trees and a yard with playground equipment are visible. The enclosure contains a black, mesh-metal milking stand where a white goat is positioned. To the right of the stand is a wooden shelving unit with black fabric bins and a white metal canister. A small wooden stool and a larger, light-colored wooden storage box are also present. A smaller brown and white goat walks on the concrete floor near the stand as the camera pans slightly to the left.",
    "Spatial": "In this wide shot, filmed from a slightly elevated perspective, a white goat initially stands on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, positioned on a black metal ramp with its back to the camera, and eventually shifts to the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
