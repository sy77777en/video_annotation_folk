  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an elderly man with white hair styled in a bun, secured with a pin, and a long white beard, wearing a traditional Chinese robe. He is positioned centrally in the frame with a serious expression. The camera is at eye level with a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. As the camera smoothly zooms out with minimal shaking, the partial upper bodies of two figures emerge in the foreground, one on the left and one on the right, framing the elderly man who is now situated in the middle ground. The blades of swords, held by the foreground figures, are visible horizontally across the lower-center of the frame. The two individuals in the foreground are dressed in dark traditional Chinese robes, and a sword is visible on the back of one person. They appear to be facing the elderly man, creating a sense of tension. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with wooden elements and traditional decor. The environment is naturally lit, with a flickering candle visible in the background, enhancing the room's warm, muted tones. Decorative elements, including hanging tassels, contribute to the ambiance, conveying a sense of historical or cultural significance and enhancing the scene's immersive quality. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this movement, maintaining focus on the elderly man as the central figure, framed by the two individuals in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
