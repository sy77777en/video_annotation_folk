  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic close-up view of a rough, textured rock surface, predominantly in shades of green, brown, and grey, with visible layers and crevices. The Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" is the primary element, initially appearing as dark, recessed characters on the textured rock surface that fills the entire foreground. The letters are arranged diagonally across the frame: \"II\" is positioned in the bottom-left, \"Α\" slightly to its right and above towards the center-left, \"Χ\" in the center, \"Ω\" to its right and above towards the center-right, and \"Ν\" in the top-right. The video begins with the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" faintly visible as dark indentations. As the frames progress, the letters start to become more distinct and illuminated, transitioning from a shadowy appearance to a bright, glowing white. The camera cranes up around the letters before transitioning into a counterclockwise roll. The movement is very smooth. Over a few seconds, these letters transition from dark indentations, perceived as part of the rock surface, to glowing bright white elements. The background remains consistent, showcasing the natural, uneven texture of the rock with its varying shades of green, brown, and grey.",

The letters, initially appearing as dark, shadowy indentations on the stone, gradually illuminate to a bright, glowing white. The background surface exhibits a layered, uneven texture with varying shades of green, brown, and grey, suggesting a natural rock formation.",

    "Scene": "The video shows a close-up of a rough, textured rock surface, predominantly in shades of green and gray, with visible layers and crevices. An overlay of the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" appears on the rock. Initially, the letters are dark and seem carved into the surface. Then, the letters illuminate, glowing bright white against the darker background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
