  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level, first-person perspective shot of a long, tiled corridor with a surreal, liminal aesthetic. Initially, a narrow walkway occupies the right and bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the distance. Slightly left of center, a metal railing extends from the foreground all the way to the end of the corridor, separating the walkway from a channel of dark, murky water. The walls, walkway, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, white square tiles, illuminated by recessed rectangular lights that create a bright, hazy atmosphere with a subtle hint of green. The camera moves smoothly forward down the tiled hallway, with mild barrel distortion and a slight shake noticeable throughout, keeping a distant large yellow rubber duck centered in the frame. The video features deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. As the camera moves steadily forward along the walkway, slight ripples can be seen on the surface of the water, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The duck, positioned at the far end of the corridor under a single, small light, grows larger and becomes the central focal point as it gets closer to the camera. The entire scene is largely static, enhancing the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment. At the end of the video, there is a very quick and subtle pan to the left, where both the tunnel and the water channel turn into a shadowed, dark area. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of unease and mystery.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, eye-level, first-person game perspective, the camera moves forward down a tiled hallway. The video features mild barrel distortion, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera initially trucks slightly to the right, with a slight shake noticeable throughout, keeping a distant rubber duck centered in the frame. At the end of the video, there is a very quick and subtle pan to the left.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling an endless, sterile pool hallway. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of unease and mystery. The scene is a long, narrow corridor with walls, a ceiling, and a narrow walkway all covered in small, white, square tiles. Alongside the walkway runs a channel of dark, murky water, separated by a simple metal railing. The space is illuminated by bright, hazy light from recessed rectangular fixtures on the walls, casting a low-saturation bright light, predominantly white with a subtle hint of green, over everything. At the far end of the corridor, a single, large, yellow rubber duck sits in a brightly lit alcove, serving as a strange and incongruous focal point in the otherwise empty and monotonous environment.",
    "Motion": "This is a first-person perspective shot moving down a long, narrow hallway with a sterile, liminal aesthetic. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in white tiles, illuminated by bright, rectangular lights. To the left of the walkway is a channel of dark water, where slight ripples can be seen on the surface, separated by a metal railing. At the far end of the hall, a large yellow rubber duck is visible. The entire scene is largely static, enhancing the eerie atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the perspective moves down a long, narrow, and sterile corridor. The walls, walkway, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, white square tiles, illuminated by recessed rectangular lights that create a bright, hazy atmosphere. To the left of the tiled walkway, a metal railing runs alongside a channel of dark green water. At the far end of the corridor, a large, classic yellow rubber duck is positioned under a single, small light. Both the tunnel and the water channel turn left, leading into a shadowed, dark area.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide, eye-level, first-person perspective shot of a long, tiled corridor. Initially, a narrow walkway occupies the right and bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the distance. Slightly left of center, a metal railing extends from the foreground all the way to the end of the corridor, separating the walkway from a channel of dark water. In the center background, a large yellow rubber duck is positioned at the far end of the corridor. The camera moves steadily forward along the walkway, causing the duck to grow larger and become the central focal point as it gets closer to the camera."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
