  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a street corner scene in a Japanese residential area, likely in the late afternoon or early evening. In the left foreground, two vending machines, one red and one white with a prominent \"100円\" sign, stand against a light-brown, textured stone-walled building. Adjacent to them, in the center middle ground, several bicycles, including a pink one, are parked neatly next to a utility pole. This pole, positioned in the center middle ground, features a pedestrian traffic light displaying a red standing figure above a circular blue-and-red \"No Parking\" sign. The street occupies the bottom foreground, curving towards the right middle ground between houses typical of Japanese residential architecture. A silver SUV is visible parked in a driveway in the center-right middle ground. Houses line the street in the middle ground and background, with overhead utility wires crisscrossing the view. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The video begins with this view, and the camera gradually moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking, revealing more of the street and the surrounding buildings. Midway, it pans slightly to the right, subtly shifting the perspective and bringing the elements slightly closer while revealing a little more of the street extending towards the left side of the frame. The camera continues to move forward, focusing on the 'no parking' sign and the parked bicycles, while the background shows residential buildings and a crosswalk. The overall composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, creating a sense of place without focusing on any single object, emphasizing the everyday atmosphere of the neighborhood.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking, and midway, it pans right to adjust its orientation while continuing forward, revealing more of the street scene.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet urban street corner, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene includes elements like a vending machine, bicycles, and residential buildings, emphasizing the everyday atmosphere of the neighborhood. The presence of a traffic light and a no-parking sign adds to the urban setting. The overall composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, creating a sense of place without focusing on any single object.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a street corner featuring two vending machines, one red and one white, with various drinks displayed. Several bicycles are parked next to the vending machines, and a 'no parking' sign is visible on a pole. The camera gradually moves forward, revealing more of the street and the surrounding buildings, including a silver car parked on the right side of the road. The camera continues to move forward, focusing on the 'no parking' sign and the parked bicycles, while the background shows residential buildings and a crosswalk.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor street corner in a Japanese residential area, likely in the late afternoon or early evening. To the left, against a building with a light-brown, textured stone wall, stand two vending machines: one is red, and the other is white with a prominent \"100円\" sign, both filled with beverages. Several bicycles, including a pink one, are parked neatly in a designated space next to the white vending machine and a utility pole. This pole holds a pedestrian crossing signal displaying a red standing figure and a circular blue-and-red \"No Parking\" sign. An asphalt road with white painted markings occupies the foreground and curves away between houses typical of Japanese residential architecture. A silver SUV is parked in a driveway further down the street. Overhead utility wires crisscross the view. The video includes a slight shift forward and to the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
