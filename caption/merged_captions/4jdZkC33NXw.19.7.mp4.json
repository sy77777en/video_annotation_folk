  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a Japanese suburban street on a rainy, overcast day. Initially, the frame shows a wet road in the middle ground, with a large tree in the left foreground and modern houses in the middle ground on the right. A white van is visible driving from right to left across the middle ground. The camera, positioned at eye level, then pans to the left, revealing a landscaped sidewalk flanked by a vibrant garden strip of green foliage, yellow flowers, and purple blossoms. The movement is slightly unsteady, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the flowers in the foreground to the houses and power lines in the background, sharp and clear. In the final composition, the sidewalk occupies the left foreground, while a vibrant flowerbed fills the bottom right foreground. The road is visible behind the flower beds, directing the viewer's attention toward distant houses and a large, netted structure, likely a golf driving range, in the right background. The scene captures a quiet, modern Japanese residential street, with contemporary houses featuring clean architectural lines set amongst lush trees, including a prominent palm tree. Numerous utility poles with a web of wires are visible, adding to the dynamic yet serene atmosphere. Cars driving along the road and parked on the side contribute to the overall tranquil atmosphere and the meticulously landscaped environment of the neighborhood.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level perspective, the camera pans and moves to the left, revealing a landscaped sidewalk and street in a Japanese neighborhood. The movement is slightly unsteady. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the yellow flowers in the foreground to the houses and power lines in the background, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a quiet, suburban streetscape scenery shot in Japan on a rainy, overcast day. The camera pans across a wet asphalt road flanked by modern Japanese homes and a commercial building, featuring a mix of white stucco walls and dark, angled roofs. Abundant, vibrant greenery, including trees, manicured hedges, and lush flowerbeds with bright yellow and purple blossoms, glistens from the rain. A prominent palm tree stands near one of the buildings, while numerous utility poles with a web of wires and a large, netted structure, likely a driving range, are visible in the background. Cars driving along the road and parked on the side add to the dynamic yet serene atmosphere of the suburban streetscape. The scene lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall tranquil atmosphere and the meticulously landscaped environment of the neighborhood.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a quiet, rainy street in a Japanese residential area. The scene is characterized by lush greenery, including trees, bushes, and colorful flowers lining the wet road and sidewalks.

    "Scene": "From a first-person point of view, the scene captures a quiet, modern Japanese residential street on a cloudy, rainy day. The camera pans left along a paved sidewalk, which is flanked by a vibrant garden strip of green foliage, yellow flowers, and purple blossoms. The asphalt road is wet, reflecting the overcast sky. Across the street, contemporary houses with clean architectural lines are set amongst lush trees, including a prominent palm tree. A white van is seen driving down the road, while other cars are parked in the yards of the houses. In the background, numerous utility poles and wires are visible, along with the tall, white netting of a large structure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
