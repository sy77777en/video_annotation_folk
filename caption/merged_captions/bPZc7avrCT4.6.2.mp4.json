  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot set on a bright, sunny day in a spacious, grassy park, two figures are positioned in the foreground: an older man with short white hair and fair skin stands on the left, wearing a white t-shirt with an American flag design, and a younger, muscular man with brown hair and a short beard stands on the right, wearing a red t-shirt with a graphic of a truck wrapped in a massive American flag decal. The scene unfolds in slow motion, capturing a green, soft, semi-transparent object resembling a water balloon as it is pressed against the younger man's right cheek, flattening upon impact. The older man faces him with his arms slightly bent and extended forward, gradually retracting them. The object deforms against the young man's face and then slowly rebounds. As the video returns to normal speed, the object completely bounces off, regains its shape, and falls to the ground. The younger man looks to his right at the older man, whose arms are now fully withdrawn. The setting features a manicured lawn in the middle ground, with a dense wall of lush green trees lining the background, creating a natural backdrop. The video begins with a slow-motion effect before transitioning to normal speed, creating a dynamic visual experience. The shot is filmed from a static, slightly unsteady, eye-level position with a level angle. Using a shallow depth of field, the camera maintains focus on the two people in the foreground. The older man lowers his arms, and the younger man continues to look at him.",

    "Subject": "An older man with short white hair and fair skin stands on the left, wearing a white t-shirt with an American flag design. He faces a younger, muscular man and extends his arms slightly bent and forward, gradually pulling them back. The younger man, who has brown hair and a short beard, stands on the right with his hands on his hips, wearing a red t-shirt with a graphic of a truck wrapped in a massive American flag decal. A green, soft, semi-transparent object, resembling a water balloon about to burst, is pressed against the young man's right cheek, deforming upon impact. As the video returns to normal speed, the balloon slightly bounces off his face, regains its original shape, and then drops to the ground. The young man looks to his right at the older man, whose arms are now fully withdrawn.",
    "Motion": "In slow motion, a green, soft object is already in contact with a younger man's cheek, suggesting it was thrown at him. An older man stands facing the younger man, with his arms slightly bent and extended forward, gradually pulling them back. The object deforms against the young man's face and then slowly rebounds. As the video returns to normal speed, the object completely bounces off, regains its shape, and falls to the ground. The younger man looks to his right at the older man, whose arms are now fully withdrawn.",
    "Scene": "Set on a bright, sunny day, the scene unfolds in a spacious, grassy park. A dense wall of lush green trees lines the background, creating a natural backdrop. An older man and a younger man stand on the manicured lawn. A green, pliable object is seen deforming as it makes contact with the younger man's face.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, two figures are positioned in the foreground: an older man on the left and a younger man on the right. The scene unfolds in slow motion, capturing a green, soft object as it is pressed against the younger man's right cheek, flattening upon impact. The older man faces him with his arms slightly bent and extended forward, gradually retracting them. As the object gently bounces off the young man's cheek, it slowly regains its original shape. The footage then returns to normal speed as the ball-like object drops out of the frame. The older man lowers his arms, and the younger man looks to his right at the older man. The setting features a grassy lawn in the middle ground, with a line of trees in the background, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
