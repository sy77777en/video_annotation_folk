  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot from behind a young man with light skin and brown, styled hair, who is positioned in the center-right of the foreground. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt, unbuttoned at the top, and has a mustache. The setting is outdoors at dusk, bathed in a cool, blue-toned light. Several older-model buses, painted a muted yellow, are visible in the background, some with headlights illuminated. The camera, from an eye-level angle, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the man, using a shallow depth of field to keep him in focus. As the camera moves, the man stands still with his eyes open before briefly closing them, maintaining a neutral expression. The camera transitions the view from his back to his right profile, then to a frontal view, and ultimately back to his rear view, while he shifts from the center-right to the center of the frame, and back to the center-right. The background buses appear to shift and blur, enhancing the focus on the central subject. The slight blur in the background suggests movement as the camera arcs around him, emphasizing the stationary nature of the man in contrast to the dynamic environment.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around a man. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus.",
    "Subject": "A young man with light skin and brown, styled hair is shown in a dimly lit, blue-toned setting. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt, which is unbuttoned at the top. The man, who has a mustache, is seen from various angles, including from behind, in profile, and facing forward with his eyes closed and a neutral expression.",
    "Motion": "A man stands still with his eyes open before briefly closing them, remaining stationary throughout the video as the camera arcs around him.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting at dusk, the scene is bathed in a cool, blue-toned light. Several older-model buses, painted a muted yellow, are positioned in the background, with some of their headlights illuminated. A man wearing a dark coat over a white collared shirt stands stationary in the space. The slight blur in the background suggests movement as the camera arcs around him.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot from behind a man who is positioned in the center-right of the foreground. In the background, several out-of-focus yellow buses are visible. The camera then arcs smoothly counterclockwise around the man, who remains relatively stationary. This movement transitions the view from his back to his right profile, then to a frontal view, and ultimately back to his rear view, all while he shifts from the center-right to the center of the frame, and back to the cente-right. As the camera moves, the background buses appear to shift and blur, enhancing the focus on the central subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
