  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a man with dark dreadlocks, wearing a red and white patterned short-sleeved shirt under an olive-green quilted vest and blue jeans, from the waist up, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is seated on a striped brown and beige rug, which occupies the bottom foreground, placed on a wooden platform that extends from the foreground to the middle ground. He holds an iPad with a black cover in the center middle ground. To his right, in the middle ground, is a small potted tree. Colorful animated features are visible on the cream-colored, crenellated walls in the background, with one on the left featuring a traffic light design and another in the middle displaying a cartoonish character with the words \"YUM! ENJOY Cola!\". The cityscape forms the distant background under a clear blue sky. The camera starts at eye level, looking down at a high angle on the man. He then closes the iPad, places it on the platform in the center middle ground, and lies down on his back on the rug, positioning his arms behind his head. Simultaneously, the camera smoothly moves backward and upward, transitioning to an extreme wide shot from a position above the subject. In this final view, the man on the rug is now a smaller figure positioned in the center-left of the frame, with a broader perspective of the rooftop, including ventilation units on the right middle ground, cables, another small plant, and the surrounding urban environment. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement, offering a wider view of the rooftop and the cityscape with numerous buildings in the background.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at eye level, looking down at a high angle on a person sitting on a rooftop. It then smoothly moves backward and upward, transitioning to an aerial view of the rooftop. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "A man with dark dreadlocks, wearing a red and white patterned short-sleeved shirt under an olive-green quilted vest and blue jeans, is initially seen sitting on a rug placed on a wooden platform on a rooftop. He is using an iPad with a black cover. He then closes the iPad, places it on the platform, and lies down on his back on the rug with his arms placed behind his head.",
    "Motion": "The man, initially sitting and using an iPad, closes the device and places it on the wooden platform beside him. He then lies down on his back on the rug, positioning his arms behind his head.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows a person on a city rooftop during the day. The rooftop is concrete with a wooden platform covered by a striped brown and beige rug. Cream-colored, crenellated walls surround the rooftop. In the background, a cityscape with numerous buildings is visible under a clear blue sky. Large, colorful, abstract animated features are displayed on the rooftop walls; one features a traffic light design, and another displays a cartoonish character with the words \"YUM! ENJOY Cola!\". A small potted tree and another small plant are also on the rooftop, along with cables and ventilation units. The drone camera gradually pulls back and ascends, offering a wider view of the rooftop and the surrounding urban environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
