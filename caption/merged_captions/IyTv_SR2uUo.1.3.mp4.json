  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full point-of-view shot from a helmet-mounted camera, showing a young boy with fair skin in the center foreground, suspended in the air with his arms outstretched. He wears a red life vest with grey straps over a sleeveless top, grey, white, and turquoise plaid swim trunks, a black helmet with the camera attached, and green and blue swimming goggles. Directly below him in the middle ground is a large blue and yellow inflatable object, surrounded by dark green water that fills the background. As the boy is launched upwards and forwards from the inflatable blob, his body rotates and tumbles, causing the camera's view to spin rapidly. The camera, with noticeable fisheye distortion, tilts upward, briefly revealing a background scene with a dock and people in the top right, an inflatable slide in the top left, and a tree-lined shore across the top. The scene is set on a lake during daytime, with a shoreline of dense green trees in the background. Visible in the surrounding water are other recreational items, including canoes, various small buoys, and a large white inflatable slide near a wooden dock where several people are gathered. The water is a calm, dark green, reflecting the clear sky above. The camera then tilts down, framing the boy's torso in the top center and his legs in the center foreground, with the water and various canoes in the middle ground appearing closer as he descends. The shot begins with an upside-down high angle as the person jumps, which then shifts to a regular high angle as they ascend. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, and the clip ends as the boy descends toward the water.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured with noticeable fisheye distortion from a helmet-mounted camera, providing an eye-level perspective. The shot begins with an upside-down high angle as the person jumps, which then shifts to a regular high angle as they ascend. The camera performs a slightly unsteady aerial track, following the person as they are launched upward and then descend toward the water. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A young boy with fair skin is launched into the air. He wears a red life vest with grey straps buckled over a sleeveless top, along with grey, white, and turquoise plaid swim trunks. On his head is a black helmet, to which the camera is attached, and a pair of green and blue swimming goggles. As he flies through the air, his arms are outstretched to his sides, and a large blue and yellow inflatable object is visible below him.",
    "Motion": "A boy is launched upwards and forwards into the air from a large inflatable object. As he soars through the air with his arms outstretched, his body rotates and tumbles, causing the camera's view to spin rapidly, showing the surrounding lake and docks before the clip ends.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a helmet-mounted camera captures the experience of being launched into the air from a large, blue and yellow inflatable blob on a body of water. The scene is set on a lake during daytime, with a shoreline of dense green trees in the background. Visible in the surrounding water are other recreational items, including canoes, various small buoys, and a large white inflatable slide near a wooden dock where several people are gathered. The water is a calm, dark green, reflecting the clear sky above.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full point-of-view shot of a boy in the center foreground, suspended in the air with his arms outstretched. Directly below him in the middle ground is a large blue and yellow inflatable object, surrounded by dark green water that fills the background. As the boy is launched higher, the camera, mounted on his head, tilts upward, briefly revealing a background scene with a dock and people in the top right, an inflatable slide in the top left, and a tree-lined shore across the top. The camera then tilts down, framing the boy's torso in the top center and his legs in the center foreground, with the water and various canoes in the middle ground appearing closer as he descends."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
