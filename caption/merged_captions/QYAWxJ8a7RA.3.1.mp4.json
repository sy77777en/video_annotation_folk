  "merged_caption": "The scene is framed from within a dark space, with an indistinct black pile at the bottom foreground and the sides of the box framing all sides of the image in the foreground, extending out through a wooden-beamed entrance in the middle ground. A person wearing a blue top stands in the center of the frame, holding a flashlight in one hand and resting the other hand on top of their head. Positioned in the center-left middle ground is a dark figure, while another figure is located in the center-right middle ground, slightly behind the central person. The background is a hazy, dust-filled environment, and the camera captures medium-full shots of the individuals at the subjects' level. The camera, from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, slowly and smoothly moves backward, employing a shallow depth of field. The focus is set on the two figures positioned in the midground, specifically in the center and on the left side of the mine entrance, while the figure on the right side is slightly farther away and appears blurred. The stylized figures in the video remain stationary. The central blue figure has one hand on top of their head and holds an open flashlight forward with the other hand. All the dark-colored figures are positioned in the middleground. The main subject of the video is a stylized figure of a man depicted in a blue hue, centrally located. He is wearing a suit, a dark tie, glasses, and a hard hat. His left hand is on his head adjusting the hard hat, while his right hand is raised, pointing a flashlight towards the camera, creating a glare. Flanking this central figure are other stylized figures of men in a dark shade of brown, also wearing hard hats. Small, light-colored particles float throughout the air, contributing to the dusty atmosphere.",

One of these figures stands to the left of the main subject, while another is positioned further back and to the right. All figures are seen through a dark, wooden-beamed frame, with the camera looking out into a brighter, hazy environment.",
    "Motion": "The stylized figures in the video remain stationary. The central blue figure has one hand on top of their head and holds an open flashlight forward with the other hand. All the dark-colored figures are positioned in the middleground.",
    "Scene": "Viewed from within a dark, enclosed space, the scene looks out through a rectangular entrance framed by rough, dark wooden beams. Beyond the opening, a hazy, dust-filled environment is illuminated by a diffuse light. Several figures wearing hard hats occupy this space. A central figure, distinguished by a glowing blue color and dressed in a suit and tie, is seen adjusting their hat. This figure is flanked by other, darker, silhouetted figures, also in hard hats. Small, light-colored particles float throughout the air, contributing to the dusty atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
