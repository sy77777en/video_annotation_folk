  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, shows a small boy with dark hair wearing a brown shirt and dark pants moving from the center-right towards a line of motionless, pale figures, which extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the right side of a vast, dark space. The figures, dressed in plain white, short-sleeved shirts with varying pants colors, stand facing a dark wall, presenting a stark, mannequin-like appearance. To the left of the line, a wheeled table with a light-colored top and a white object is positioned. In the background left, dimly lit, glass-walled rooms are visible, while in the center of the space is a large pillar. The figures are illuminated by a spotlight from the right, casting long shadows to the left, although the light source is not visible. The boy briefly moves right, toward the line of figures, while a white, open-sided golf cart with its headlights on enters from the left side of the middle ground frame and eventually stops next to a slanted pillar in the middle ground. Two white-clad figures exit the golf cart and join the line. The camera, from an overhead, high-angle perspective, smoothly trucks right, tilting down slightly to track the child running toward the crowd. After the child joins the line, the camera pauses and then moves subtly forward. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus. The vast, dark, and cavernous indoor space is defined by large support pillars and a high, arched ceiling, rendered in a stark, monochromatic style. Light from the right casts long shadows across the floor, which features a section of dark grating.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead, high-angle perspective, the camera smoothly trucks right, tilting down slightly to track a child running toward a crowd. After the child joins the line, the camera pauses and then moves subtly forward. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, cavernous space, a small boy with dark hair is seen wearing a brown shirt and dark pants. To his right, a long, orderly line of adult figures stands motionless, all facing a dark wall. These figures are uniformly dressed in plain white, short-sleeved shirts, but the color of their pants varies from dark to light, presenting a stark, almost mannequin-like appearance. Their features are indistinct, and they are illuminated by a light source coming from the right, though it is not visible. A small, wheeled table with a light-colored top and a white object resting on it is positioned to the left of the line of people. In the middle ground, a white, open-sided golf cart with its headlights on is also present.",
    "Motion": "A small boy runs from the center of the frame and steps into a long, motionless line of white-clad figures. A white golf cart with its headlights on then enters from the left, and two white-clad figures exit the golf cart and join the line. The figures in the line remain completely still throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video, a small character in a brown shirt runs towards a line of pale, humanoid figures in white clothing, standing still and facing a dark wall. The vast, dark, and cavernous indoor space is defined by large support pillars and a high, arched ceiling, rendered in a stark, monochromatic style. Light from the right casts long shadows across the floor, which features a section of dark grating. To the left, a series of dimly lit, glass-walled rooms can be seen in the background. A small, wheeled table with an object on its surface is positioned to the left of the line. A small, white vehicle with its headlights on drives into the scene from the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
