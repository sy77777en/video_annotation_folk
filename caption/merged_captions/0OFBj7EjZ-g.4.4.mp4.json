  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of numerous wooden pallets arranged in a grid-like pattern across a flat surface, occupying the foreground and middle ground, extending towards the background. Metallic components hover above the pallets, extending from the foreground to the background and distributed evenly throughout the scene. These metallic structures create a layered effect over the pallets. The video opens with a view of these components gradually descending towards the pallets. As the video progresses, the metallic components settle gently onto the pallets, coming to rest on them, aligning directly on top of the pallets. This transition shifts the metallic elements from an elevated position to one that is level with the pallets, maintaining their central placement within the frame. The camera features a level angle, focusing on the foreground with a shallow depth of field, and smoothly moves downward while slightly tilting up, maintaining focus on the pallets in the foreground. The background features geometrically patterned walls, which remain static and unchanging. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the interaction between the descending metallic components and the stationary pallets, emphasizing the alignment and uniformity of the grid-like structure. The environment is an indoor setting with a modern, industrial aesthetic, featuring a spacious room with a grid-patterned floor. The pallets are made of light brown wood, showcasing a simple, rectangular shape with visible slats, contrasting with the abstract, metallic structures with irregular edges and a flat shape suspended above. The lighting is neutral, suggesting an artificial source, and there are no visible windows or natural light. In the lower-left corner, the overlay includes the text \"[15],\" providing additional information without obstructing the view of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera with a level angle, focusing on the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly moves downward while slightly tilting up, maintaining focus on the pallets in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a dynamic scene with numerous wooden pallets arranged in a grid-like pattern on a flat surface. Each pallet has a metallic component above it. These metal components have smooth, reflective surfaces and sharp, angular edges. The pallets are uniformly spaced and have a natural wood texture, contrasting with the sleek metallic forms. The arrangement highlights a juxtaposition of natural and industrial elements, with the metallic structures resting atop the static pallets.",
    "Motion": "The video opens with a view of several wooden pallets arranged in a grid pattern on a flat surface, with metallic components hovering above. As the video progresses, these components gradually descend towards the pallets. Eventually, the metallic components settle gently onto the pallets, coming to rest on them.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a modern, industrial aesthetic. The environment features a spacious room with a grid-patterned floor and numerous wooden pallets arranged in rows. The pallets are made of light brown wood, showcasing a simple, rectangular shape with visible slats. Above the pallets, abstract, metallic structures with irregular edges and a flat shape are suspended, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The walls in the background have a geometric design with angular patterns, contributing to the contemporary feel. The lighting is neutral, suggesting an artificial source, and there are no visible windows or natural light. In the lower-left corner, the overlay includes the text \"[15],\" providing additional information without obstructing the view of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
