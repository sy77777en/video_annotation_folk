  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a medium over-the-shoulder shot, with a translucent blue woman positioned in the right foreground, her back to the camera. Her body glows with a blue light, with intricate patterns of light resembling circuitry visible on her back and neck. She has short, dark blue hair cut in a bob. A man in bulky, green, metallic armor stands in the left-center of the frame, located in the middle ground, facing her. His head is completely enclosed in a helmet with a reflective orange visor, and the armor shows signs of damage and wear. He holds a large, dark-colored rifle. In the background, the indistinct shapes of vehicles are visible within a dimly lit, futuristic indoor space resembling a hangar, featuring dark, metallic walls and structural elements. The armored man then takes several slow steps forward, closing the distance between himself and the stationary woman. As he advances, the camera moves backward while tilting upward, with some slight shaking, transitioning the framing into a medium close-up, showing him from the chest up and making him more dominant in the frame. The camera uses focus tracking to keep the mesh soldier in the foreground sharp, shifting the focus plane and changing the camera to a low angle. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot begins with a static camera at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground. The camera then moves backward while tilting up, with some slight shaking. As it moves, it uses focus tracking to keep the mesh soldier in the foreground sharp, shifting the focus plane and changing the camera to a low angle.",
    "Subject": "A man in bulky, green, metallic armor stands holding a large, dark-colored rifle. His head is completely enclosed in a helmet with a reflective orange visor, and the armor shows signs of damage and wear. He faces a woman who is seen from behind. Her body is translucent and glows with a blue light, with intricate patterns of light, resembling circuitry, visible on her back and neck. She has short, dark blue hair cut in a bob. The man in armor walks closer to the woman during the scene.",
    "Motion": "A man in green armor, holding a rifle, takes several slow steps forward, closing the distance between himself and a stationary, blue, translucent woman who is seen from behind. As the man walks, the camera moves backward and tilts upward.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character, shows their upper body and the scene ahead within a dimly lit, futuristic indoor space resembling a hangar. The environment features dark, metallic walls and structural elements, with the indistinct shapes of vehicles visible in the background. Facing the viewpoint is a figure clad in green, scuffed metallic armor with a reflective orange visor, holding a large, dark weapon. The back of the foreground character, who has short, dark hair, is translucent blue and marked with glowing, circuit-like patterns. During the scene, the armored figure takes several steps forward.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a medium over-the-shoulder shot, with a translucent blue woman positioned in the right foreground, her back to the camera. A man in green armor stands in the left-center of the frame, located in the middle ground, facing her. In the background, the indistinct shapes of vehicles are visible within a dimly lit hangar. The armored man then walks forward, moving toward the viewpoint and the woman. As he advances, the framing transitions into a medium close-up, showing him from the chest up and making him more dominant in the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
