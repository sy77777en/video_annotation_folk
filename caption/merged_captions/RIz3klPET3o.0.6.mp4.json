  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a 2D game with a side point of view, presented as an extreme wide shot. A small, abstract figure, composed of thin black lines and colored dots, resembling a stick figure wearing a round-topped hat and riding a small vehicle adorned with green, blue, and red ribbons, starts in the center-left area of the frame. It rolls dynamically downwards towards the bottom-left, moving along five short, black horizontal lines that are arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. The abstract linear figure, which includes colored dots and resembles a bicycle with a rider, travels diagonally downwards and to the left across the screen. Concurrently, some of its line segments rotate, simulating wheels, while other articulated lines perform a continuous, cyclical motion akin to pedaling. However, the entire figure rotates backward without exhibiting any forward motion. The camera smoothly pedestals down while trucking to the left to track the subject from the side. The scene is set within a minimalist, abstract digital space featuring a pure white background. The camera maintains a side-view perspective, positioned at the height of the action, against a plain light gray background. Accompanying the figure are short, thick black lines that symbolize elements like steps, changing dynamically as the figure moves. The scene includes several intermittent, short, thick, black horizontal line segments arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from left to right, serving as platforms. A small, animated figure, composed of various colored parts including small green, blue, and red elements, consistently navigates these platforms, positioned near the center-left of the screen.",

    "Scene": "A side-view 2D gaming video captures a scene in profile within a minimalist, abstract digital space featuring a pure white background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
