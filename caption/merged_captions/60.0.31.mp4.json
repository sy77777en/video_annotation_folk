  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot, featuring the main woman in black with dark skin and long braids tied back in a ponytail in the left foreground, and a second woman with lighter skin and dark hair in a ponytail, wearing a bright pink sleeveless athletic top over a black short-sleeved shirt, in the center foreground. Both women are engaged in a dynamic soccer activity on a sunlit outdoor sports field with a green grassy surface. The woman in black initiates a lateral move to the right, extending her left arm, appearing to kick a soccer ball about to enter the frame. In response, the woman in pink shifts to her left to maintain her defensive position, extending her right arm, resulting in both women moving in the same lateral direction across the field. The shot transitions to a full shot as the camera, positioned at hip level, moves backward unsteadily with noticeable shaking, making the subjects appear smaller in the frame and revealing more of the green sports field, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. During this transition, both women shift from their initial positions slightly towards the right of the frame, remaining in the foreground. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the two women in the foreground in focus. In the midground, two additional women in pink athletic wear are running. Blue bleachers extend horizontally across the middle ground, with a multi-story building and green trees visible in the top right background against a bright sky. The point of view from the camera operator moving unsteadily across the field adds a sense of dynamic motion and instability to the shot.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at hip level, maintaining a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the two women in the foreground in focus. The camera moves backward unsteadily, with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a woman with dark skin, her dark hair styled in long braids tied back in a ponytail. She wears a black short-sleeved athletic shirt with a small white Swoosh logo on the right chest and black athletic shorts. Interacting closely with her is another woman with a lighter skin tone, whose dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail. This second woman wears a bright pink sleeveless athletic top over a black short-sleeved shirt, paired with black athletic shorts. Both women are engaged in what appears to be a dynamic soccer activity. In the midground, there are two additional women in pink athletic wear.",
    "Motion": "The woman in black on the left initiates a lateral move to the right, extending her left arm, and appears to be kicking a soccer ball that is about to enter the frame. In response, the woman in pink on the right simultaneously shifts to her left to maintain her defensive position, extending her right arm, resulting in both women moving in the same lateral direction across the field. Additionally, two other women are running in the middle ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds on a sunlit outdoor sports field, likely for soccer or football, with a green grassy surface. The point of view is from a camera operator moving unsteadily across the field, adding a sense of dynamic motion and instability to the shot. In the background, blue bleachers of a stadium are visible, and beyond them, a multi-story building with windows and green trees can be seen against a bright sky.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium full shot, featuring the main woman in black in the left foreground and a second woman in pink in the center foreground. The shot then transitions to a full shot as the camera moves backwards, making the subjects appear smaller in the frame and revealing more of the green sports field, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. During this transition, both women shift from their initial positions slightly towards the right of the frame, remaining in the foreground. Throughout the shot, blue bleachers extend horizontally across the middle ground, with a building and trees visible in the top right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
