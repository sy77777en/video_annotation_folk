  "merged_caption": "This video focuses on a person trapped in a ceiling, visible from mid-thigh to below the chest, wearing a white shirt, a blue striped tie, and dark pants. The subject occupies the center of the frame, holding a notebook in their right hand while their left hand hangs naturally by their side. The person is positioned in the middle ground, with the ceiling forming the immediate background. The ceiling is light-colored, with visible cracks radiating from the point of impact, suggesting a forceful collision. The camera angle is from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, situated slightly below the subject's height, capturing the scene from behind another individual wearing dark-brown clothing, whose head is partially visible in the bottom right corner of the frame. This secondary figure is in the foreground, adding depth to the scene. The camera is static, positioned at hip level, capturing a low-angle view with deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. The subject remains in the same position throughout the frames, with no significant movement or change in posture, emphasizing the static nature of the scene. The setting is lit with natural lighting, indicating a daytime environment, and the overall atmosphere is static, with no visible movement or changes in the environment. The ceiling, featuring cracks radiating from the point of impact, is located directly above the subject, emphasizing the unusual situation. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning; the focus remains consistently on the subject's unusual placement in the ceiling, maintaining the same framing and perspective. The camera remains stationary, ensuring the subject stays centered while highlighting the static nature of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
