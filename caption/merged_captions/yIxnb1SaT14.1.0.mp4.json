  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape from an aerial-level, level-angle perspective, capturing a serene view of the Paris skyline at night. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp, and features a slow and smooth zoom-out effect, gradually revealing more of the scene. In the foreground, a portion of an ornate building occupies the far left, while dark rooftops fill the bottom of the frame and extend into the middle ground. The background features several illuminated landmarks against a dark sky: the Eiffel Tower, brilliantly illuminated in gold with a powerful searchlight beam rotating from its peak across the dark, overcast sky, is positioned on the right. A large Ferris wheel glows with bright white light in the center-left, and further to the left, the golden dome of Les Invalides is visible. The midground and foreground are filled with the dark silhouettes of Parisian rooftops, with some windows lit from within. On the far left, a portion of an ornate stone building is seen. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" below it. The slow zoom-out effect enhances the focus on the expansive urban environment and its nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the scale and beauty of the city.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
