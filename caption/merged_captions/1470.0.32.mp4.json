  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a light-skinned young woman with blonde hair is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting in a bathtub filled with an abundance of white soap bubbles that cover her up to her chest. Her hair is wrapped in a pink towel, and she wears orange earmuffs. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down at her, capturing the scene from a high angle with a slightly unsteady shot that uses a shallow depth of field to keep the woman in focus. Her mouth is wide open, and her eyes are widened with a look of fear directed diagonally upward, as if she is screaming. As she recoils slightly, her upper body remains mostly stationary while her legs actively and rapidly kick in the bubble-filled tub. The background features a blurred brown wall and a blue towel hanging in the upper right corner, with a radiator situated to the left rear of the bathtub. In the foreground, a dark, out-of-focus shape partially obscures the view on the left.",

    "Scene": "In a bathroom, a bathtub is filled with an abundance of white soap foam. A person with a pink towel wrapped around their head and wearing orange earmuffs is partially submerged in the bubbles, their mouth open wide.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
