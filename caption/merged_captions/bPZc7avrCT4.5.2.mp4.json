  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a person with light-skinned hands holding a yellow and black DeWalt cordless drill horizontally in the left and center foreground. Attached to the drill's chuck is a red, cylindrical hole saw bit, over which a partially inflated yellow balloon, appearing to be filled with liquid, is stretched. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the drill and balloon in the foreground, with a blurred background of trees visible. As the person activates the drill, the attached red hole saw bit and the yellow balloon begin to spin rapidly. The video employs a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to an even slower motion, before returning to the original slow motion. The balloon wobbles and its shape distorts from the fast rotation. After a few seconds of spinning, the balloon detaches from the bit and flies off toward the lower right corner of the frame, remaining fully visible. The hands and drill move toward the right side of the frame initially, and after the balloon detaches, they shift leftward and gradually exit the frame, leaving only the drill bit visible.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the drill and yellow balloon in the foreground. The video employs a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to an even slower motion, before returning to the original slow motion.",
    "Subject": "A person with light-skinned hands holds a yellow and black DeWalt cordless drill horizontally. Attached to the drill's chuck is a red, cylindrical hole saw bit. A partially inflated yellow balloon is stretched over the end of this bit. As the drill is activated, the balloon spins rapidly, its shape distorting due to the motion, before it detaches from the bit and flies away.",
    "Motion": "A person activates a cordless drill, causing the attached red hole saw bit and the yellow balloon stretched over it to spin rapidly. The balloon wobbles and its shape distorts from the fast rotation. After a few seconds of spinning, the balloon detaches from the bit and flies off towards the lower right corner of the frame.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting with a blurred background of trees, a person holds a yellow and black cordless drill. Attached to the drill is a red, cylindrical hole saw bit, over which a balloon that appears to be filled with liquid is stretched. As the drill spins, the balloon wobbles and deforms before detaching and flying toward the lower right of the frame, remaining fully visible.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot initially frames a person's hands holding a cordless drill in the left and center foreground. A yellow balloon, attached to the drill's bit, is positioned in the center of the foreground, with a blurred forest visible in the background. The balloon spins in place, then detaches, flying from its starting position toward the right side of the frame and slightly downward, eventually coming to rest in the lower right corner of the frame. The hands and drill move toward the right side of the frame initially, and after the balloon detaches, they shift leftward and gradually exit the frame, leaving only the drill bit visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
