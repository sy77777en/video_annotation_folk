  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the lower half of a person with a warm, medium-brown skin tone, wearing a long, flowing yellow dress with a floral pattern and brown, strappy sandals. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their legs and feet prominently displayed as they walk across a patterned tile floor featuring geometric designs in shades of black, white, green, and earthy yellow. The camera is positioned at ground level with a high angle, looking down, and uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the walking foot in the midground. The rhythmic motion is captured in slow motion, with the camera initially tracking the feet from the front as they move forward from the center of the frame towards the bottom center foreground, indicating a steady pace. The dress sways slightly with each step, emphasizing the elegance and detail of the attire against the intricate floor design. The environment suggests a spacious hall or corridor, well-lit, possibly during the day or under artificial lighting. The camera maintains a consistent level with the subject's feet throughout the sequence, capturing the movement from a frontal perspective. Towards the end, the person steps backward, moving away from the camera, which slightly adjusts its position by moving backward and slightly forward as the foot steps back. The movement is slow and slightly unsteady, with some shaking, while the background remains blurred, keeping the focus on the person's feet and the detailed pattern of the floor. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the subject remains centrally framed while walking, ensuring a direct view of the walking motion.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a foot walking. The camera is positioned at ground level with a high angle, looking down. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the walking foot in the midground. The camera tracks the foot from the front, initially moving backward and slightly forward as the foot steps back near the end. The movement is slow and slightly unsteady, with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person with a warm, medium-brown skin tone wearing a long, flowing yellow dress with a floral pattern. The focus is on their legs and feet as they walk across a patterned tile floor. The person is wearing brown, strappy sandals. The dress moves slightly with each step, emphasizing the motion of walking. The scene captures the elegance and detail of the dress and footwear against the intricate geometric design of the floor.",
    "Motion": "A person wearing a yellow floral dress and brown sandals is walking across a checkered floor with a pattern of black, white, green, and brown tiles. The camera closely follows the movement of their feet, capturing the rhythmic motion as they initially walk towards the camera. Towards the end, the person steps backward, moving away from the camera. The background is blurred, keeping the focus on the person's feet and the detailed pattern of the floor.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an indoor setting with a patterned tile floor featuring a geometric design in shades of black, white, green, and earthy yellow. The environment is likely a spacious hall or corridor, characterized by its intricate flooring. The lighting suggests it is well-lit, possibly during the day or under artificial lighting. A person wearing a yellow floral dress and brown sandals walks across the tiles, adding movement to the scene. The focus remains on the floor's detailed pattern and the gentle motion of the person's steps, creating a harmonious blend of color and texture.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the lower half of a person walking. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their legs and feet prominently displayed. The person's feet move forward from the center of the frame towards the bottom center foreground, indicating a steady pace. The dress, which extends down to the ankles, sways slightly with each step. The patterned tile floor, featuring geometric designs in various colors, extends from the foreground to the background, filling the entire frame beneath the subject. The camera maintains a consistent level with the subject's feet throughout the sequence, capturing the movement from a frontal perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the subject remains centrally framed while walking. The camera height is at the subject's level, ensuring a direct view of the walking motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
