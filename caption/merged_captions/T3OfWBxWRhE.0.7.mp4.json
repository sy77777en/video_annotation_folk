  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from a level-angle aerial perspective. The sun is located on the left side of the frame, with its golden reflection extending across the calm, blue-green ocean from the background to the foreground. The ocean occupies the lower half of the frame. In both the background and middle ground, a mountainous coastline stretches along the right side, while clouds are scattered across the top half of the frame. Several small, dark islets dot the water in the middle ground. A small section of green, grassy land with a few small palm trees is initially visible in the bottom right foreground before moving out of the frame. The greatly accelerated time-lapse video, captured from a smooth, aerial-level camera at a level angle, uses a deep focus that keeps the entire coastal landscape sharp. The camera performs a complex movement, simultaneously moving forward, panning right, and trucking left to sweep across the scene. The time-lapse effect causes the clouds to move across the sky and creates a fast-moving ripple pattern on the water's surface, flowing from the background toward the foreground. The sun hangs low on the horizon, its golden light reflecting across the ocean, illuminating scattered, orange-tinged clouds against a soft blue sky. In the distance, a mountainous coastline recedes into the haze, enhancing the serene atmosphere. The natural mist or ripple effect on the water's surface is a result of the time-lapse technique used in filming. The composition lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the grand scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural setting, with the interplay of light and color creating the primary visual focus.",

    "Camera": "This greatly accelerated time-lapse video is captured from a smooth, aerial-level camera at a level angle. Using a deep focus that keeps the entire coastal landscape sharp, the camera performs a complex movement, simultaneously moving forward, panning right, and trucking left to sweep across the scene.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of a tropical coastline at either sunrise or sunset. A bright sun hangs low on the horizon, its golden light reflecting across the calm, blue-green ocean on the left side of the frame, illuminating scattered, orange-tinged clouds against a soft blue sky. In the distance, a mountainous coastline recedes into the haze, while a few small, dark islets dot the water. The composition lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the grand scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural setting, with the interplay of light and color creating the primary visual focus.",
    "Motion": "This video is a scenic, aerial shot of a tropical coastline. The camera slowly moves over the calm ocean during a beautiful sunrise or sunset. The tranquil scene features the sun's reflection on the water, soft clouds, and a distant mountainous shore.",
    "Scene": "A drone video captures a stunning coastal scene at sunrise or sunset, with the sun casting a bright, golden reflection primarily on the left side of the calm, blue-green ocean. The sky features a blend of pale blue and orange hues, with scattered, puffy clouds illuminated in shades of white and orange, enhancing the serene atmosphere. In the distance, a mountainous coastline appears as a dark silhouette, while several small, dark islands are scattered across the water. At the beginning of the video, a sliver of green, grassy land with a few small palm trees is visible in the bottom right corner before moving out of the frame. The natural mist or ripple effect on the water's surface is a result of the time-lapse technique used in filming.",

In both the background and middle ground, a mountainous coastline stretches along the right side, while clouds are scattered across the top half of the frame. Several small islands are positioned in the middle ground. A small section of green land is initially visible in the bottom right foreground before moving out of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
