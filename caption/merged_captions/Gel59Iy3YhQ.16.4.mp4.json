  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, a small, white, pixelated humanoid character with a round body and a rectangular head featuring two black dots for eyes stands on the center-left of a multi-tiered purple platform structure in the foreground. To the character's left is a purple cube, and to its right are stacked purple blocks. On a lower platform to the bottom right, a small red, mushroom-like creature with a rounded cap is visible. The background consists of a dark purple wall with an intricate network of glowing green and purple lines resembling circuitry, while a bright magenta surface occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera quickly arcs 90 degrees clockwise three times, with brief pauses between each arc, as the character stands in place making various gestures. After the camera completes its arcs, the white character jumps to the right onto a purple platform and then walks to the left toward the cube-like object. The cube levitates and transforms into a complex, multi-colored, rotating geometric shape resembling a tesseract, with green, blue, and yellow faces visible within its structure. As the character jumps down, the cube also begins to descend. The camera subtly moves downward as the character jumps off the stage. The character ends up standing to the right of this new object. Throughout the sequence, the small red mushroom-like creature on the lower platform remains stationary.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth shot of a video game. The camera quickly arcs 90 degrees clockwise three times, with brief pauses between each arc, then subtly moves downward as the character jumps off the stage.",
    "Subject": "A small, white, pixelated humanoid character with a round body, a rectangular head featuring two black dots for eyes, and a small red object on its head is the central figure. This character interacts with a cube-like object that initially has a purple and pinkish hue. The cube then transforms into a complex, multi-colored, rotating geometric shape resembling a tesseract, with green, blue, and yellow faces visible within its structure. On a lower platform, a small, red, mushroom-like creature with a rounded cap is also present.",
    "Motion": "A small, white, pixelated character stands in place, making various gestures while the camera arcs clockwise three times. After the camera completes its arcs, the character jumps to the right onto a purple platform and then walks to the left toward a cube-like object. The cube levitates and transforms into a complex, multi-colored geometric shape that rotates in place. As the character jumps down, the cube also begins to descend. A small, red, mushroom-like creature on a lower platform remains stationary throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, is set in a digital-style environment. The scene features a multi-tiered structure composed of purple, blocky platforms, some of which have green, moss-like accents. The background is a dark purple wall with an intricate network of glowing green and purple lines resembling circuitry. At the very bottom of the scene is a bright magenta and white surface. On the platforms, there are several stacked purple blocks and a small red mushroom-like object on a lower level. A small, white, blocky character moves on the top platform, where a circular button prompt containing the letter 'A' appears next to the character. This prompt then transforms into a colorful, rotating cube.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, a small white character stands on the center-left of a multi-tiered purple platform structure in the foreground. To the character's left is a purple cube, and to its right are stacked purple blocks. On a lower platform to the bottom right, a small red creature is visible. The background consists of a dark purple wall with glowing circuitry, while a bright magenta surface occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. After the camera arcs clockwise three times, the white character jumps down to the right, then walks to the left towards a floating cube, which moves to the center of the top platform and transforms into a rotating, multi-colored geometric shape. The character ends up standing to the right of this new object."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
