  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up of a detailed miniature mine scene. A rocky mound occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The wooden mine entrance, featuring weathered planks and a small overhang, is positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground, built into this mound. Metal tracks emerge from the mine entrance, running diagonally towards the bottom right foreground, where a small minecart filled with dark material resembling coal is situated. A wooden crate is visible in the center-left, in the middle ground, beside the tracks near the mine entrance. The ground, a textured brownish-purple, covers the foreground and middle ground across the bottom half of the frame. A textured, brownish backdrop fills the background, visible across the top and right side of the frame. The camera angle starts level and transitions to a high angle as the camera moves up and tilts down, positioned slightly above the miniature scene, looking down at a gentle angle. The focus is shallow, initially on the midground, and changes through a rack focus. The camera movement is very smooth. In the foreground at the bottom left corner of the frame, there is a yellowish-brown, blurred object that appears to be a wooden structure, partially obstructing the view. The overall composition captures the essence of a mining environment on a miniature scale, with attention to detail in the textures and materials used, such as the rocky mound's textured surface and the minecart's simple, boxy shape with a metallic finish.",

    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a detailed miniature scene depicting a mine entrance. The scene includes a rocky mound with a textured surface, giving the appearance of rugged terrain. A wooden entrance structure is built into the mound, featuring weathered planks and a small overhang. In front of the entrance, a small minecart sits on metal tracks, positioned as if ready to enter or exit the mine. The minecart is simple in design, with a boxy shape and a metallic finish.

    "Scene": "The scene depicts a miniature model of a mine entrance set against a textured, brownish backdrop. A weathered wooden structure with a sloped roof forms the mine opening, nestled into a grey, rocky mound. A small, light-colored mine cart, filled with dark material resembling coal, rests on a set of parallel metal tracks leading out from the dark mine entrance. A wooden crate sits beside the tracks near the entrance. The ground is a textured brownish-purple, simulating dirt or gravel. Additionally, in the foreground at the bottom left corner of the frame, there is a yellowish-brown, blurred object that appears to be a wooden structure, partially obstructing the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
