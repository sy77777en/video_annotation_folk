  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a static shot from inside a car trunk, facing outward toward a large frosted window that fills most of the upper center of the frame, with the camera at the subject’s height. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the midground where the character appears. In the foreground, a blue storage bin with various items is positioned at the bottom left, and a brown rounded object is at the bottom right. Initially, a person with light skin and short, dark brown hair is faintly visible through the left side of the frosted window, placing them in the background and top left of the frame. They are wearing a dark jacket and a yellow scarf, and their expression is neutral. As the person opens the trunk from outside the car, the trunk lid rises, revealing more of their upper body in a medium shot, occupying the center and left middle ground, while the blue bin and brown object remain in the lower corners. The person places a dark-colored bag into the trunk, with the bag briefly appearing in the center foreground. As the trunk closes, the person’s hand, which is light-skinned and unadorned, is visible at the top center middle ground, pushing the lid down, while the rest of their body moves out of view. The setting appears to be a small, enclosed space with light-colored walls and a door or window frame that is rectangular and made of metal or painted wood. The lighting is soft and cool, with the natural light from outside creating a muted, subdued atmosphere. Throughout, the camera remains stationary, and the spatial arrangement shifts mainly due to the trunk opening and closing, which changes the visibility and prominence of the person and their hand within the frame.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, stop-motion shot filmed from a low, eye-level angle. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the midground where the character appears.",
    "Subject": "A person with light skin and short, dark brown hair appears outside the car, initially visible only as a faint face through the left window. The person then opens the trunk, revealing more of their upper body in a medium shot. They are wearing a dark jacket and a yellow scarf, and their expression is neutral. The person places a dark-colored bag inside the trunk, then attempts to close it. As the trunk closes, only their hand, which is light-skinned and unadorned, remains visible as it pushes the trunk lid down.",
    "Motion": "The person first opens the trunk from outside the car, causing the trunk lid to rise and reveal more of their upper body. They then place a dark-colored bag inside the trunk, and finally use their hand to push the trunk lid down, closing it.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors, looking toward a large frosted window that diffuses the daylight and obscures the view outside. The setting appears to be a small, enclosed space with light-colored walls and a door or window frame that is rectangular and made of metal or painted wood. On the left side, a blue plastic storage bin holds various items, including a red and white object and a brush with dark bristles. On the right, a brown, rounded object rests near the floor. In the center foreground, a black bag is placed during the video. The lighting is soft and cool, with the natural light from outside creating a muted, subdued atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video. This enclosed indoor space is possibly the cargo bed of a truck.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
