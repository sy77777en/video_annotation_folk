  "merged_caption": "This video features a close-up, high-angle shot of a long passenger train car moving diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. The train car occupies the center of the frame, while the background, consisting of a blurry green and brown landscape, fills the top left and top right corners. Initially, the train car's roof is opaque, featuring small, evenly spaced, round raised stuff, but it becomes transparent, revealing the detailed internal layout of the car. The interior consists of numerous compartments, including narrow corridors, small private rooms (some equipped with fixtures resembling sinks or toilets), and larger communal areas furnished with standard seating. The internal walls are primarily white and light-colored, while the flooring is gray and light-colored, with some partitions featuring a wood-like texture. The camera is at an aerial level, maintaining a high angle as it moves rightward and forward, tracking the train from a bird's-eye view. It steadily zooms in to focus on a carriage, using deep focus to keep everything sharp, and the movement is very smooth. Shadows of trees appear to move towards the lower left corner of the frame due to the camera's movement. The sides of the car are a darker gray or blue-gray, with multiple small, rectangular windows, and black lines demarcate the divisions between car sections. The train is shown against a blurry, textured background of green and brown, indicative of land. As the train moves, the camera remains stationary relative to the moving train, providing a consistent view of the evolving scene.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a train car moving diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. The camera follows the train, appearing stationary relative to it. As the train moves, the initially opaque roof gradually becomes transparent, revealing the internal layout. The background remains a blurred mix of green and brown, suggesting a natural landscape.",
    "Scene": "A drone captures an overhead view of a long passenger train with a light gray roof moving across a green and brown landscape. Shadows of trees appear to move towards the lower left corner of the frame due to the camera's movement. ",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
