  "merged_caption": "This bird's-eye view shot captures the scene from a top-down perspective, with the nose cone of a white rocket prominently positioned in both the foreground and middle ground at the bottom center of the frame. The rocket features orange V-shaped markings on its pointed nose cone, and a black, boxy action camera is mounted centrally on this nose cone, pointing vertically upward towards the sky. Initially, a large cloud of white smoke and dust erupts from the base of the rocket, visible directly below, as it launches vertically into the air from a desert launch site. The arid landscape, characterized by sparse green scrub, a dirt road, and other launch structures with white, triangular bases and long, thin, dark-colored poles extending outwards at an angle, forms the background. As the rocket ascends, the camera moves smoothly straight up, transitioning from a wide shot to an extreme wide shot, maintaining a deep depth of field that keeps the ground below in sharp focus throughout the ascent. This movement causes the background elements—including the smoke cloud, the dirt road, and the surrounding landscape—to recede and shrink within the frame, emphasizing the size contrast between the rocket and the expansive scene. The body of the white rocket, marked with an orange V-shape, remains prominently visible, while the desert launch site and a nearby road quickly recede and become smaller from the viewpoint of the onboard camera. The locked-on POV shot from the camera mounted on the nose of the rocket captures its ascent, with the large cloud of white dust and smoke erupting on the sandy ground below, rapidly shrinking from view as the rocket continues its upward trajectory.",

    "Camera": "This bird's-eye view shot is captured from a camera mounted on a rocket. The camera starts at an overhead level, looking directly down at the launch site. As the rocket launches, the camera moves smoothly straight up, ascending to an aerial level. A deep depth of field keeps the ground below in sharp focus throughout the ascent.",
    "Subject": "A white rocket with orange V-shaped markings on its pointed nose cone is shown from a bird's eye perspective. A black, boxy action camera is mounted near the tip of the nose cone, pointing vertically upward towards the sky. A large, dense cloud of white smoke and dust billows out from the base of the rocket. In the vicinity on the ground, there are several other launch structures, each consisting of a white, triangular base and a long, thin, dark-colored pole extending outwards at an angle.",
    "Motion": "From a bird's eye view, a large cloud of white smoke and dust erupts from the base of a rocket as it launches vertically into the air. The rocket rapidly ascends, and from the viewpoint of the onboard camera, the desert launch site and a nearby road quickly recede and become smaller.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the nose of a rocket captures its ascent from a desert launch site. As the rocket lifts off, a large cloud of white dust and smoke erupts on the sandy ground below. The arid landscape, characterized by sparse green scrub, a dirt road, and other launch structures casting long shadows, rapidly shrinks from view. The body of the white rocket, marked with an orange V-shape, is prominently visible in both the foreground and middle ground, with the black camera clearly mounted on its tip.",
    "Spatial": "This bird's-eye view shot captures the scene from a top-down perspective, with the nose cone of a rocket prominently positioned in both the foreground and middle ground at the bottom center of the frame. A GoPro camera is mounted centrally on this nose cone. Initially, a cloud of smoke is visible directly below the rocket, with the desert ground and other launch structures forming the background. As the rocket ascends, the camera moves vertically away from the ground, transitioning from a wide shot to an extreme wide shot. This movement causes the background elements—including the smoke cloud, a dirt road, and the surrounding landscape—to recede and shrink within the frame, emphasizing the size contrast between the rocket and the expansive scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
