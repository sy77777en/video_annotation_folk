  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a retro-style game with a distinctly atypical visual presentation. The main game environment, composed of magenta blocky architectural elements including walls with arched openings and a central multi-level rectangular structure, occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame and is situated in the middle ground. A small, magenta pixelated player character is positioned in the middle ground, initially on the left side of the central structure, and is depicted climbing upwards on this structure using a magenta shoe. After climbing over the structure, the character continues moving towards the upper right, reaching the archway, and is then located in the upper right of the middle ground, arriving at a conical gate but not exiting the frame. Meanwhile, in the bottom left of the frame, a green shoe moves from the bottom towards the right, disappearing near the right edge and reappearing at the bottom left of the central structure, changing to a magenta color. The user interface elements are located in the foreground, across the bottom third of the screen. Specifically, a magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom left, containing a white abstract pixelated figure next to \"04\" and, initially, a green shoe icon below it; this green shoe icon later disappears from the scroll and reappears as a magenta shoe in the middle ground, positioned near the left wall within the game world. In the bottom center, the yellow pixelated word \"DAY\" and the white text \"00\" are displayed in the foreground. Another magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom right in the foreground, framing a red-outlined rectangular area which contains a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure that is slowly moving to the right. The camera is completely static, and due to the 2.5D nature of the video, the camera height and angle are difficult to determine.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a retro-style game with a distinctly atypical visual presentation. The game world is rendered in an isometric perspective using highly pixelated graphics, dominated by a magenta color for its blocky architectural elements, such as walls with arched openings and a central multi-level rectangular structure, all set against a stark black background. A small, magenta, highly simplified pixelated player character is depicted climbing on the magenta structure. The user interface at the bottom features two magenta scroll-like elements on either side. The left scroll displays another small, white, abstract pixelated figure next to the white number \"04\", with a green shoe icon below it. This shoe later disappears and reappears in front of the wall within the game, having changed to a magenta color. In the center, the word \"DAY\" appears in a yellow pixelated font, accompanied by a small yellow pixelated graphic. The right scroll contains a red-outlined rectangular area, within which a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure is visible. The overall aesthetic is characterized by its extremely limited color palette and low-resolution, blocky design, giving all subjects an archaic and stylized appearance.",
    "Motion": "In a retro-style game with a magenta color scheme, a small pixelated character is seen using a magenta shoe to ascend a magenta block structure. The character starts at the bottom left of the structure and gradually moves upward. After reaching the top, the character descends slightly before continuing to the right. Eventually, the character arrives at a conical gate in the upper right corner but does not exit the frame. Meanwhile, in the bottom left of the frame, a green shoe moves from the bottom towards the right, disappearing near the right edge and reappearing at the bottom left of the central structure, changing to a magenta color. In the bottom right, a red-outlined rectangular area contains a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure that is slowly moving to the right.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming scene with a tilted overhead angle, showing an indoor environment in a three-quarters perspective. The setting is a room constructed from magenta brick-like elements against a black background, featuring two prominent arched doorways on the left and right. In the center of the room stands a rectangular structure, three cubes high and four cubes long, also made of magenta cubes. A small, magenta humanoid figure is depicted climbing up the side of this central structure. Overlay elements are visible at the bottom of the screen: on the left, a magenta scroll contains a white stick figure icon next to \"04\" and a green item icon below; in the center, the yellow text \"DAY\" is displayed with white text \"00\" below it, flanked by elements that are part of the magenta scroll; and on the right, another magenta scroll frames a red rectangular outline containing an animated white shape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
