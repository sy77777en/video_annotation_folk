  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, showcasing a large, domed neoclassical building prominently in the center of the frame. The building, constructed from light-colored stone, features a prominent portico with tall, fluted Corinthian columns supporting a triangular pediment adorned with a relief sculpture depicting several human figures in classical attire. Multiple stone statues of human figures are positioned along the roofline and at the base of a large, greenish-copper dome that crowns the building. A golden statue of a winged figure stands atop the lantern at the very peak of the dome. As the camera, positioned at a low angle, rapidly dollies forward and tilts upward, the shot transitions into a wide shot. This movement brings the building from the middle ground to fill the foreground, shifting the focus from the entire structure to its upper half. The triangular pediment and the base of the dome become central, while the golden statue at the top remains in the upper center of the frame, framed by a sky with fast-moving white clouds. The camera moves forward at a high speed, creating a motion blur effect on the surrounding buildings and landscape, while the central neoclassical building remains the focal point. The scene is set during the day under a blue sky, and the periphery of the view is blurred with a radial motion effect, creating a sense of speed, while the central cathedral remains in focus. Other buildings are visible on the sides of the square. The video, filmed by a drone, moves rapidly toward the French Cathedral in Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt square, with the camera swiftly and smoothly dollies forward and tilts up, transitioning to a low angle to focus on the statue atop the building's pediment.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone moves rapidly toward the French Cathedral in Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt square.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
