  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a very muscular, dark-skinned man crouching in the center of the frame, surrounded by a large, chaotic pile of books. He is shirtless, revealing a highly defined physique, and wears black pants. His face is broad with a stern, intense expression. His left hand rests on a closed blue book, while his right hand is on his knee. The books around him are of various colors, including green, brown, and blue, with many lying open or stacked haphazardly, displaying unfamiliar symbols and text. As the man slightly rises while maintaining his intense forward gaze, two books land on his head and right shoulder, remaining in place. Throughout the movement, he extends his left hand forward while his right hand continues to rest on his knee. The camera tilts upward with very smooth movement to follow his rising motion, revealing his upper body. The scene is set indoors within a room completely filled with books, covering the entire floor. The lighting is dim and diffuse, casting soft shadows throughout the book-strewn environment, creating a still and quiet atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "With very smooth movement, the camera tilts upward to reveal the upper body of a muscular man kneeling among a pile of books.",
    "Subject": "A very muscular, dark-skinned man is shown in a low crouch, surrounded by a large, chaotic pile of books. He is shirtless, revealing a highly defined physique, and wears black pants. His face is broad with a stern, intense expression. His left arm is extended, resting on a closed blue book, while his right hand is on his knee. The books around him are of various colors, including green, brown, and blue, with many lying open or stacked haphazardly. Some book covers and pages display unfamiliar symbols and text. During the scene, a few books land on his head and shoulders.",
    "Motion": "The muscular man, initially in a low crouch, slightly rises while maintaining his intense forward gaze. Two books land on his head and right shoulder, remaining in place. Throughout the movement, he extends his left hand forward while his right hand rests on his knee, continuing to hold his crouched position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a room completely filled with a chaotic pile of books. A muscular, shirtless man wearing dark pants is positioned in the center, crouching amidst the clutter. The books, which cover the entire floor, are of various colors including green, brown, and dark blue. Many have covers and open pages displaying unfamiliar scripts and symbols. As the man begins to rise, the books remain stationary, creating a still and quiet atmosphere. The lighting is dim and diffuse, casting soft shadows throughout the book-strewn environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
