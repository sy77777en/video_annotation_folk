  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a minimalist, black-and-white line drawing depicts a cartoonish figure riding a peculiar sled-like vehicle, beginning in the center of the frame on a short, diagonal black line. The figure, composed of simple lines and wearing a small, black-and-white hat, is followed by three small, colored squares—blue, green, and red. As the character moves from the center towards the right, the camera smoothly tracks its movement, keeping it centered in the frame. The figure slides down the diagonal line, with the colored squares trailing behind, and then moves across a series of disconnected horizontal and diagonal black lines, appearing to hop from one to the next as it travels downwards and to the right. The camera primarily moves rightward and downward, revealing more short, disconnected black lines that form a descending, staggered path across the frame. The setting is a minimalist 2D environment against a plain, light gray background, with the black lines acting as platforms for the character to traverse. The character travels from the center to the center-right, finally landing on a long, continuous horizontal line and continuing to slide along it to the right, with the squares still in tow. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a side-on perspective, capturing the scene in profile. At the conclusion of the video, the number \"26\" becomes visible at the end of the final platform line.",

    "Camera": "In this 2D side-view game with black hand-drawn lines, the camera smoothly tracks the character, keeping it centered in the frame. It primarily moves rightward and downward as the avatar descends to lower platforms.",
    "Subject": "A minimalist, black-and-white line drawing depicts a cartoonish figure riding a peculiar vehicle. The figure, composed of simple lines, wears a small, black-and-white hat. Three small, colored squares—blue, green, and red—trail behind the figure, with a small blue area at the back and a small red area at the front of its body. The vehicle resembles a sled-like runner, held by two ropes positioned at the front. The scene also contains several short, black lines, some horizontal and some diagonal, which appear to form a path or a series of platforms for the character.",

    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera captures the scene in profile, a minimalist 2D environment is presented against a plain, light gray background. The setting consists of several short, disconnected black lines scattered across the space, acting as platforms for a small, stylized character on a vehicle to traverse. At the conclusion of the video, the number \"26\" becomes visible at the end of the final platform line.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot, a character on a vehicle begins in the center of the frame, positioned on a short, diagonal black line. As the character moves from the center towards the right, the camera tracks its movement, revealing more short, disconnected black lines that form a descending, staggered path across the frame. The character travels from the center to the center-right, finally stopping on a long, horizontal line. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a side-on perspective."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
