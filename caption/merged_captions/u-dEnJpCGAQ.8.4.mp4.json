  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a landscape from a high angle. Initially, the scene is framed by green foliage in the foreground on the left side and bottom. A dark-water lake is positioned in the center of the middle ground, surrounded by a dense forest. In the background, a large, forest-covered mountain occupies the top half of the frame. The camera, in a smooth aerial shot, moves forward at a slight high angle, gliding over the treetops towards the serene lake. This movement causes the foreground elements to gradually shift toward the edges of the frame, opening up the view and making the centrally located lake and the surrounding middle-ground forest more prominent, while the background mountain remains a constant element. The calm, mirror-like water of the lake reflects the sky and the dense, verdant trees that encircle its shores. A deep focus ensures that the entire landscape, from the foreground foliage to the distant mountains, remains sharp and clear. The scene is framed by vibrant green leaves and branches in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective. Small patches of grassy vegetation are visible along the edges and within the body of the water. The still surface of the lake reflects the sky and the dense foliage that lines its shores, while a large, forest-covered mountain looms in the background under a bright sky. The focus is intentionally placed on the expansive and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the scale and pristine beauty of the remote location. The elements within the scenery appear nearly motionless, enhancing the serene and tranquil atmosphere of the scene.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a serene, dark-water lake nestled within a lush, green forest. The still surface of the lake reflects the sky and the dense foliage that lines its shores, while a large, forest-covered mountain looms in the background under a bright sky. The scene is framed by vibrant green leaves and branches in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the expansive and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the scale and pristine beauty of the remote location.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a tranquil lake surrounded by a dense, green forest. In the background, a large mountain covered in trees rises into the sky. The calm water of the lake reflects the sky and the surrounding foliage, with the elements within the scenery appearing nearly motionless.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone moves slowly forward over a lush, green forest, revealing a secluded lake nestled in a valley. The calm, mirror-like water of the lake reflects the sky and the dense, verdant trees that encircle its shores. In the background, a large mountain, also covered in a thick blanket of green forest, rises into the sky, with parts of its slope illuminated by sunlight. The foreground is filled with the vibrant green leaves of various trees and shrubs, framing the view of the tranquil valley and the surrounding trees. Small patches of grassy vegetation are visible along the edges and within the body of the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
