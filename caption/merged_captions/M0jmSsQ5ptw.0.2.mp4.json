  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a parachutist wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white helmet, landing in the center middle ground on a large, circular grey platform with a red bullseye. Their large white parachute, featuring a red and yellow \"Red Bull\" logo, billows above and behind them, occupying the upper left of the frame, with dry, rolling hills and a mountain range stretching across the horizon under a bright blue sky dotted with white, puffy clouds. As the parachutist runs onto the target platform, managing the lines, the parachute collapses behind them. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle and deep focus, initially focuses on the parachutist, then pans right and trucks rightward, moving the first subject to the left of the frame before they exit the shot. This pan reveals a large, elaborate wooden and metal contraption in the center and right foreground of the frame, and a second person standing in the top right, middle ground, on a raised wooden structure. This individual, wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, is positioned on a wooden ramp that is part of the contraption, holding a large wooden board upright with their left hand, with a skateboard at their feet. The person glances downward and makes a quick, slight hop, causing both their feet and the skateboard to momentarily lift slightly off the ramp. A long, blue tarp fence is visible in the mid-ground, separating the main area from the grassy fields beyond. Despite some shakiness in the shot, the entire scene remains sharp, capturing the dynamic movements and spatial relationships within the environment.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level shot with a level angle and deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera initially focuses on the parachutist, then pans right and trucks rightward to reveal a skateboarder on a ramp, although there is some shakiness in the shot.",
    "Subject": "A person wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white helmet lands on a large, circular grey platform with a red bullseye, their large white parachute featuring a red and yellow \"Red Bull\" logo billowing behind them. As the parachute deflates, the view pans to the right, revealing a smaller circular white platform with a red bullseye connected to a complex wooden and metal contraption. Standing on a wooden ramp that is part of this structure is a man in a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, holding a large wooden board, with a skateboard at his feet.",
    "Motion": "A parachutist runs onto a circular target platform, managing the lines as their large white parachute billows and then collapses behind them. The view then pans to the right, revealing a second person on a wooden ramp. This person glances downward and makes a quick, slight hop, causing both their feet and the skateboard to momentarily lift slightly off the ramp, all while maintaining their grip on the large wooden board, holding it upright with their left hand.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with white, puffy clouds. In the background, dry, rolling hills and a mountain range stretch across the horizon. A person with a large, white parachute emblazoned with the Red Bull logo lands on a circular, raised black platform marked with a grey ring and a red center. To the right of the landing platform stands an elaborate wooden and metal contraption, where another individual in a yellow shirt is positioned. A long, blue tarp fence is visible in the mid-ground, separating the main area from the grassy fields beyond.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a parachutist landing in the center middle ground on a large, circular platform. Their parachute billows above and behind them, occupying the upper left of the frame, with hills in the background. As the parachutist comes to a stop, the camera pans to the right, moving the first subject to the left of the frame before they exit the shot. This pan reveals a large contraption in the center and right foreground of the frame, and a second person standing in the top right, middle ground, on a raised wooden structure. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
