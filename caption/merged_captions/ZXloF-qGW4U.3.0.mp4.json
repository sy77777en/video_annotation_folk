  "merged_caption": "The shot begins framed between the walls of the hallway, which occupies the foreground and extends into the middle ground. Vertical pillars, similar to those on the sides of a doorway, frame the view through which the rest of the scene is visible. Initially, a silhouetted figure of a woman is positioned in the middle ground at the far center of the hall. The video opens on a dark view through a doorway, looking into a long hallway bathed in intense pink and purple light. A silhouetted figure of a woman with long hair is revealed standing at the far end of the hall. She appears to be wearing a jacket and high-heeled shoes. As the video progresses, the woman moves laterally from left to right relative to the frame, consistently moving to the center of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. A silhouetted woman, initially standing still at the far end of a hallway, slowly walks from the left side of the door's opening toward the center of the doorway. She takes a few deliberate steps before slightly turning to face the camera in the middle of the entryway. This movement is captured as a full shot of the subject, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. This is a static, eye-level shot filmed from a level angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the walls of the hallway in the foreground that lead up to the door. The corridor is bathed in a deep magenta and purple glow emanating from unseen sources and a bright light fixture at the far end. This intense lighting casts a red reflection on the polished floor. At the end of the hall, a silhouetted figure stands near a table. Above the table, a glowing, geometric object, appearing to be a purple light fixture, hangs from the ceiling.",

    "Scene": "Viewed from between two dark structures resembling the sides of a doorframe with an arched top, a long, narrow hallway stretches into the distance. The corridor is bathed in a deep magenta and purple glow emanating from unseen sources and a bright light fixture at the far end. This intense lighting casts a red reflection on the polished floor. At the end of the hall, a silhouetted figure stands near a table. Above the table, a glowing, geometric object, appearing to be a purple light fixture, hangs from the ceiling. Additionally, there is a purple light in the ceiling of the room where the silhouetted figure is located.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
