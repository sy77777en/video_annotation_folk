  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where a leaf-covered dirt path is positioned in the center, starting in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and receding into the background. On the left and right sides, dense trees and green foliage occupy the foreground and middle ground, forming a dark, natural tunnel over the path. This tunnel frames a bright, hazy area of light in the distant background, located in the center of the frame. Small, luminous particles float through the air, primarily in the foreground and middle ground on the right. From a hip-level, level-angle perspective, the camera executes a smooth dolly zoom, moving backward while simultaneously zooming in on the tree-lined path. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant clearing sharp. As the camera moves, points of light created by sunlight filtering through gaps in the canopy appear and disappear, enhancing the scene's ethereal quality. The wind lifts the fallen leaves from the ground into the air, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled light and long shadows across the leaf-strewn ground. At the far end of the arboreal tunnel, a brighter, hazy light glows, suggesting an opening or clearing just beyond view. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and enchantment.",

    "Subject": "This is a nature scenery shot depicting a dirt path winding through a dense, dark forest. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and enchantment. Trees with thick, green foliage arch over the trail, forming a natural tunnel that recedes into the distance. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled light and long shadows across the leaf-strewn ground. At the far end of the arboreal tunnel, a brighter, hazy light glows, suggesting an opening or clearing just beyond view. As the camera moves, points of light created by sunlight filtering through gaps in the canopy appear and disappear, enhancing the scene's ethereal quality.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a path winding through a dense, dark forest, covered in fallen leaves and dappled with sunlight filtering through the overhead canopy. The trees form a natural archway or tunnel, leading towards a brighter, slightly misty clearing in the distance. The camera moves backward along the path while zooming in, drawing the viewer into the woods. The wind lifts the fallen leaves from the ground into the air, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Holes in the forest canopy appear and disappear due to camera movement, enhancing the scene's enchanting quality.",
    "Scene": "A dirt path, covered in fallen brown leaves, leads through a dense forest. On either side of the path, there is lush green foliage and dark tree trunks. The branches of the trees overhead form a natural, dark tunnel. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the ground. A gentle breeze lifts the fallen leaves into the air, adding movement to the serene scene. In the distance, the end of the path is illuminated by a brighter, hazy light.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide scenery shot where a leaf-covered dirt path is positioned in the center, starting in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and receding into the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
