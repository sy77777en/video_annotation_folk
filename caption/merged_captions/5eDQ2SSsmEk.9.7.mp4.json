  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on a small portion of a flying vehicle located in the upper-right corner of the frame, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. This initial segment places the vehicle in the foreground while the rest of the scene remains in the background. As the vehicle descends towards a platform in space, the shot size transitions to a full view, capturing the entire vehicle as it moves towards the center of the frame. The vehicle's descent shifts its 2D position from the upper-right to the center, maintaining its foreground placement. The platform on which the vehicle lands occupies the middle ground, extending horizontally across the frame. The surrounding space structures and beams of light are positioned in the background, enhancing the depth of the scene. The camera maintains a high-angle view, looking down from above, with a deep focus and large depth of field, rolling counterclockwise smoothly and slowly, ensuring steadiness throughout. The vehicle, with a sleek, futuristic design and glowing red and blue lights, gradually becomes more visible as it approaches the platform. Its metallic and reflective surface highlights distinct geometric shapes, reflecting the surrounding light. The environment is characterized by towering structures and machinery, with beams of light cutting through the darkness, creating a stark contrast. The scene is illuminated by various light sources, including spotlights and glowing indicators, adding to the high-tech atmosphere. By the end, the shot size expands to a wide shot, showcasing the vehicle fully landed on the platform, centered in the frame, with the expansive space environment enveloping it from all sides. The camera's consistent overhead angle ensures a comprehensive view of the vehicle's landing process and its final position on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle view, looking down from above, with a deep focus and large depth of field. The camera is at an aerial level, resembling a space environment. It rolls counterclockwise smoothly and slowly, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small portion of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right corner, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. As the vehicle descends, it becomes fully visible, revealing a sleek, futuristic design with glowing red and blue lights. The vehicle's surface appears metallic and reflective, with distinct geometric shapes. The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a flying vehicle descending towards a platform in space. The vehicle, with a dark, angular design and illuminated elements, gradually becomes more visible as it approaches the platform. The vehicle's surface reflects the surrounding light, highlighting its metallic and futuristic appearance. The vehicle finally lands on the platform, with its full structure now clearly visible, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a futuristic, industrial setting viewed from an objective perspective. It takes place in a dimly lit, expansive space, possibly a docking area or a large platform, with a metallic and mechanical aesthetic. The environment is characterized by towering structures and machinery, with beams of light cutting through the darkness, creating a stark contrast. The scene is illuminated by various light sources, including spotlights and glowing red and blue indicators, adding to the high-tech atmosphere. The presence of a vehicle, with sleek, angular design and illuminated elements, suggests movement and activity within this space. The overall ambiance is enhanced by a sense of depth and scale, with scattered particles or stars visible in the background, contributing to the scene's otherworldly feel.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
