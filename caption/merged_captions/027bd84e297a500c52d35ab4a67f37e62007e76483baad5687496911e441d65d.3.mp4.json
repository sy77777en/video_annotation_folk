  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of two Russian nesting dolls, also known as matryoshka dolls, positioned in the lower middle part of the frame, with the camera at the subjects' level. The dolls are painted with traditional designs, including floral patterns and musical instruments, with a blue and white color scheme. Initially, a slightly smaller doll with an accordion design is centered in the foreground, while a larger doll with a balalaika design remains hidden behind it in the middle ground. The video begins with a static camera at a level angle, and the focus transitions from being out of focus to focusing on the first matryoshka doll in the foreground, utilizing a pull focus technique. A hand enters the frame from the upper right corner, moves to the lower right side, and gently flicks the smaller doll, causing it to exit the frame from the left side. This action reveals the largest nesting doll, which features a balalaika pattern, that was previously behind the smaller one. As the smaller doll is flicked out of view, the focus becomes unclear again. The hand then exits from the upper right corner. This movement alters the composition by removing one subject and highlighting another, with the larger doll shifting into the center of the frame. Throughout the video, the background remains a plain white surface, ensuring the focus stays on the intricately painted dolls, showcasing vibrant colors and traditional designs. The spatial arrangement changes from having the smaller doll in the foreground to the larger doll taking its place, maintaining the central position. The hand's movement is smooth and deliberate, emphasizing the transition between the two dolls.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
