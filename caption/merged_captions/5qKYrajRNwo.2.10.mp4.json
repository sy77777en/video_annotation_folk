  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair, wearing a dark blue dress with short sleeves and a white undershirt, interacting with a large, dark-colored box. The girl occupies the center-right portion of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, and leans forward towards the box, which is located slightly to her left in the middle ground. The box is a prominent object in the scene, situated near the center-left of the frame. The setting is an indoor environment with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere, featuring a wooden surface cluttered with various items, including the box with a latch. The walls have a textured appearance with circular openings allowing light to filter through, creating a dappled effect. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the cozy ambiance with an earthy color palette of deep browns, greens, and hints of vibrant colors from surrounding fabrics. The camera is positioned at hip level with a low angle, looking up at the subject, and remains fixed but slightly unsteady, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field, highlighting the character interacting with the box. The girl's actions involve opening the box; initially, her hands are on the latch, and then she lifts the lid using both hands, though the contents inside are not visible to the camera. Her posture is leaning forward, indicating curiosity or intent focus. The background features a wall with circular openings, casting light patterns across the scene. Various items, such as fabrics and other objects, are scattered around the room, filling the lower left and right areas of the frame. The camera remains at the girl's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
