  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, capturing its entire body as it lies on a patch of grass in a serene outdoor forest setting during the daytime. The wolf is positioned in the center of the frame, with its body oriented towards the left side, providing a direct side profile view. The forested area is characterized by tall trees with textured bark and a scattering of green and yellow autumn leaves. The ground is covered with patches of green grass and fallen leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. The lighting is soft, indicating a clear day with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting gentle shadows. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the wolf in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. In the 2D plane, the wolf occupies the central-right portion of the frame, while in the 3D space, it is positioned in the middle ground. The surrounding trees form the middle ground and background, with some trees closer to the wolf and others further away. As the video progresses, the wolf begins to rise from its lying position, lifting its head and front legs, and continues to stand up, fully extending its body. It then starts to turn right before moving forward down a slope, gradually disappearing from the frame. After the wolf disappears, the shot remains static, focusing on the grassy area and the trees. The remaining scene includes the grass in the foreground, spanning across the bottom of the frame, and the trees in the middle ground and background, filling the rest of the frame. The camera maintains its position at the previous subject's level, continuing to capture the forest setting without any movement.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the wolf in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, lying on a patch of grass. The wolf is positioned in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. Its body is oriented to the left, with its head turned slightly in the same direction, giving a side profile view. The wolf appears calm and relaxed. As the video progresses, the wolf disappears from the frame, leaving only the grassy area and trees visible.",
    "Motion": "A wolf is lying on the grass in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. The wolf begins to rise from its lying position, lifting its head and front legs. It continues to stand up, fully extending its body. The wolf then starts to turn right before moving forward, gradually disappearing from the frame. The final frames show the empty grassy area and trees, indicating the wolf has completely left the scene.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a serene outdoor forest setting during the daytime, characterized by tall trees with textured bark and a scattering of autumn leaves. The ground is covered with patches of green grass and fallen leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. The lighting is soft, indicating a clear day with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting gentle shadows. The scene focuses on the forest floor and the surrounding trees, maintaining a tranquil and observational perspective throughout.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a full shot of a wolf, capturing its entire body as it lies on a patch of grass. Initially, the wolf is positioned in the center of the frame, with its body oriented towards the left side. In the 2D plane, the wolf occupies the central-right portion of the frame, while in the 3D space, it is positioned in the middle ground. The surrounding trees form the middle ground and background, with some trees closer to the wolf and others further away. The camera is at the wolf's level, providing a direct side profile view. As the wolf stands up, it starts to turn right before moving forward down a slope, gradually disappearing from the frame. After the wolf disappears, the shot remains static, focusing on the grassy area and the trees. The remaining scene includes the grass in the foreground, spanning across the bottom of the frame, and the trees in the middle ground and background, filling the rest of the frame. The camera maintains its position at the previous subject's level, continuing to capture the forest setting without any movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
