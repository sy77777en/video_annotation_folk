  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a view down a narrow, paved alleyway. A building with a light green metal door, adorned with posters and graffiti, occupies the right foreground, alongside a sticker-covered drainpipe and a curtained window. A low concrete wall runs along the left foreground and middle ground. Beyond the wall, train tracks are visible in the middle ground, extending into the background, leading towards a distant cityscape with a domed building in the background center, all under a clear sky at the top of the frame. From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the camera pans left unsteadily along the narrow walkway, revealing more of the building's facade and the low concrete wall on the left side. The movement stops as a pair of hands, clad in a black jacket, enters from the bottom of the frame, raising a black digital camera into the center foreground. The camera is aimed at the cityscape, and its screen, displaying this view, becomes the central focus, with the original background cityscape now visible around and below the camera. The shot exhibits slight unsteadiness and shaking, along with mild barrel distortion. A deep focus is used, keeping both the foreground wall and the background city sharp. The person holding the camera adjusts the angle slightly before taking the photo. The perspective is consistently first-person, at eye level, as if through the character’s eyes, navigating an urban walkway in Porto during clear daylight. The scene encompasses train tracks below and the distant cityscape featuring a domed building, all under a clear blue sky with a few birds.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a first-person perspective of someone standing in a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. A low concrete wall runs along the other side of the alley. Initially, the view looks down the alley towards a distant cityscape under a clear sky. Then, a pair of hands, belonging to a person wearing a black jacket, raises a black digital camera into the frame, aiming it towards the cityscape to take a picture. The camera's screen displays the cityscape view.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a first-person view of a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. The camera pans to the left, revealing more of the building's facade and the low concrete wall on the left side. The person holding the camera raises it, positioning it to take a photo of the cityscape in the distance. The camera's screen shows the cityscape view as the person adjusts the angle slightly before taking the photo.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates an urban walkway in Porto during clear daylight. The scene begins alongside a building with a light green facade marked by graffiti, various posters including a large colorful one and three smaller black-and-white dragon-themed prints, a sticker-covered drainpipe, and a curtained window. The view then moves along the cobblestone path, which is lined by a concrete barrier, to encompass train tracks below and the distant cityscape featuring a domed building, all under a clear blue sky with a few birds. Subsequently, two hands appear, raising a black digital camera to frame the urban panorama on its screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
