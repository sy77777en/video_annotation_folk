  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot from a first-person perspective, focusing on the ambiance of a public square populated by pedestrians. The unsteady, first-person POV shot moves forward, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. Initially, the enclosed patio of a restaurant occupies the right foreground and middle ground, featuring a dark brown wooden frame with large glass windows, revealing tables set with white tablecloths and wine glasses under a red awning. A cobblestone plaza extends from the bottom-center foreground into the background. In the left middle ground, an ornate, dark green lamppost stands on a stone base in front of a large, historic white stone building with prominent columns and steps. As the camera moves forward and pans slightly to the left, the restaurant patio on the right recedes from view. The lamppost moves from the left middle ground to the mid-left side and becomes more prominent, bringing the plaza and the stone building into a more central and prominent position by the end of the shot. The camera maintains a consistent level angle throughout, with deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp and a large depth of field. Pedestrians in casual clothing walk about in both the middle ground and background, contributing to the lively atmosphere of the cobblestone plaza in this historic European city. The scene captures the ambiance of a European-style public square on an overcast day, with no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
