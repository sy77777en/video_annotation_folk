  "merged_caption": "In a low-angle wide shot, six silhouetted figures gradually come into view from both sides of the foreground, moving to the middle ground. The camera remains static, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene from the figures to the tall trees and sky sharp. The figures are seen running away from the camera among tall, slender trees with sparse leaves, set against a clear blue sky during the daytime. The bright sun is positioned in the bottom center-right of the frame, creating a prominent lens flare that washes out the center of the image with intense white light. A reddish-purple light leak is visible along the left side and top right edge. The second figure on the left, initially seen in a blurry close-up, has a human form with what appears to be long hair or a headdress and is wearing brownish-yellow pants with a grey top. The first figure on the right appears to be carrying a large backpack or bulky gear on its back. The other figures are dressed mostly in blue, grey, and white. In the middle ground to background, tall trees extend from the bottom of the frame upwards across the scene, their branches reaching upward.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle shot taken from ground level, looking up at figures in a forest. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the figures to the tall trees and sky sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a low-angle perspective, six silhouetted figures are visible among tall, thin trees against a bright blue sky with a glaring sun. The second figure on the left, initially seen in a blurry close-up, has a human form with what appears to be long hair or a headdress and is wearing brownish-yellow pants with a grey top. The first figure on the right appears to be carrying a large backpack or bulky gear on its back. The other figures are dressed mostly in blue, grey, and white. The surrounding trees are mostly bare, with some having sparse leaves, and their branches all reaching upward.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle perspective, several silhouetted figures are seen among the trees, running away from the camera, with the camera remaining static.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective looking up through a forest of tall, slender trees with sparse leaves, the scene is set against a clear blue sky during the daytime. The bright sun is positioned in the bottom center-right of the frame, creating a significant lens flare that washes out a portion of the view with intense white light. A reddish-purple light leak is visible along the left and the top right edge. Six figures are running away from the camera from either side, partially obscuring the view.",
    "Spatial": "In a low-angle wide shot, six silhouetted figures gradually come into view from both sides of the foreground, moving to the middle ground. In the middle ground to background, tall trees extend from the bottom of the frame upwards across the scene, against the blue sky. A bright sun in the bottom center-right background creates a prominent lens flare that washes out the center of the image, and a reddish light leak is visible along the left side and top right edge."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
