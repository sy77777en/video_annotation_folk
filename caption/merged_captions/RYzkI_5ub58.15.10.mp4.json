  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a large group of horses positioned centrally within the frame. The horses, predominantly displaying shades of black and brown with a few white ones, form a dense cluster, occupying the middle ground, with their dark coats contrasting against the light, patchy terrain. The group is primarily located in the center, with some extending slightly towards the left and right, maintaining a cohesive formation. The surrounding landscape, visible in the background, consists of snow, sparse vegetation, and patches of dry grass, creating a textured pattern across the ground. The camera, positioned above the scene, captures the horses from a high angle, emphasizing the vastness of the arid landscape and the collective movement of the animals. The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor scene in a vast, arid landscape. The ground is covered with patches of dry grass and sparse vegetation, possibly blanketed by snow, creating a textured pattern against the light-colored earth. A large herd of horses is seen moving together in a barren, sparsely vegetated landscape. The horses are densely packed, and their movement is synchronized as they traverse the area. The background is a dry, open field with patches of dry grass and snow scattered across the ground. The herd maintains a consistent formation throughout the sequence, indicating a coordinated movement. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The time of day is not clearly defined, but the lighting suggests a bright, clear atmosphere typical of midday. The framing remains consistent throughout, with no significant changes in shot size or subject position.",

    "Camera": "The video is captured from an aerial level with a high angle, looking down on a group of people. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large group of horses gathered closely together. The horses predominantly display shades of black and brown, with a few white ones present. They are positioned in a dense formation, suggesting movement or a gathering. The scene captures the collective presence of the horses, emphasizing their numbers and diversity in color.",
    "Motion": "A large herd of horses is seen moving together in a barren, sparsely vegetated landscape. The horses are densely packed, and their movement is synchronized as they traverse the area. The background is a dry, open field with patches of dry grass and snow scattered across the ground. The herd maintains a consistent formation throughout the sequence, indicating a coordinated movement.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor scene in a vast, arid landscape. The ground is covered with patches of dry grass and sparse vegetation, possibly blanketed by snow, creating a textured pattern against the light-colored earth. A large group of animals, possibly horses, is gathered in the center, forming a dense, moving cluster. Their dark coats contrast with the pale surroundings, and their movement creates a dynamic element within the otherwise still environment. The time of day is not clearly defined, but the lighting suggests a bright, clear atmosphere typical of midday. The drone's aerial perspective provides a broad view of the scene, emphasizing the expanse of the terrain and the collective motion of the animals.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
