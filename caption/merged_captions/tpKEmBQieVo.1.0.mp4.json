  "merged_caption": "The camera is mounted on the back of a person's helmet, providing a point-of-view perspective looking upwards. Initially, the person's wingsuit, predominantly black and bright yellow-green with blue trim and a white \"GoPro\" logo, occupies the bottom foreground of the frame, with their shoulders and the back of their helmet visible. A dark, rocky mountain formation is in the middle ground, positioned centrally and extending towards the bottom right and bottom left, framing a patch of blue sky with white clouds in the top center background. The camera, fixed behind the person's head, provides a worm's-eye view looking directly up as they jump off a cliff. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. As the video progresses, the person appears to descend rapidly, and the camera moves backward and downward in sync with the person, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and some shaking. The wingsuit remains in the bottom foreground, with the \"wings\" spreading slightly to the bottom left and bottom right. The mountain remains prominent in the middle ground and background, filling most of the view behind the person. The visible area of sky and clouds in the top background remains significant, occupying nearly half of the frame. The perspective gives a sense of extreme proximity to the imposing rock formations, with the steep mountain walls passing by as the person moves forward, indicating flight along the terrain. In the distance, another rocky slope with patches of snow can be seen, enhancing the dramatic landscape.",

The camera moves backward and downward in sync with the person, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video offers a perspective from a camera mounted behind a person's head. The person's wearing a wingsuit, which is predominantly black and bright yellow-green, with blue trim accents. A white \"GoPro\" logo is visible on the back of the suit. The view includes the yellow bottom part of the helmet. The background features brown mountains, a blue sky, and white clouds.",
    "Motion": "The camera, mounted behind the head of a person in a wingsuit, initially looks up at a rocky mountain peak against a cloudy sky. The person then moves forward, and the camera maintains an upward view as steep mountain walls pass by, indicating flight along the terrain.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to a helmet, shows a rapid descent very close to a sheer, towering rock cliff face. The cliff, predominantly brownish-grey with a rough texture, rises steeply against a backdrop of blue sky interspersed with large, white, fluffy clouds. The object visible at the bottom of the view, likely a wingsuit, features black and bright yellow/lime green fabric with blue trim and a \"GoPro\" logo on the back. In the distance, another rocky slope with patches of snow can be seen. The perspective gives a sense of extreme proximity to the imposing rock formations.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
