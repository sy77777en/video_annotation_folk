  "merged_caption": "An extreme close-up shot frames a smartphone's vertical camera array, which occupies the center of the foreground. A person's light-skinned hand holds the dark blue smartphone steady, though the camera and hand exhibit slight shaking due to natural hand movements. The phone features a vertical camera array with three distinct lenses, each surrounded by a ridged, black metallic ring. From the top right, the sharp, silver blade of a utility knife extends into the foreground, with its tip pressed against the metallic rings surrounding the middle camera lens in the center of the frame. The utility knife is repeatedly scraped back and forth across the metallic ring surrounding the middle camera lens, creating visible scratch marks at the point of contact. Afterward, the knife also makes contact with and scrapes the metallic ring surrounding the upper camera lens. The scraping motion is short and quick, creating visible marks on both rings' surfaces. The background is out of focus, with something colorful visible in the top-left corner. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down, and uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the lenses in the foreground in sharp focus.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, high-angle shot of a smartphone's camera lenses. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the lenses in the foreground in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A person's light-skinned hand holds a dark blue smartphone steady. The phone has a vertical camera array with three distinct lenses, each surrounded by a ridged, black metallic ring. The sharp, silver blade of a utility knife is pressed against the metallic ring border surrounding the middle camera lens, with visible scratch marks at the point of contact.",
    "Motion": "A utility knife is repeatedly scraped back and forth across the metallic ring surrounding the middle camera lens of a smartphone, which is held steady by a hand. Afterward, the knife also makes contact with and scrapes the metallic ring surrounding the upper camera lens. The scraping motion is short and quick, creating visible marks on both rings' surfaces.",
    "Scene": "In an extreme close-up shot, a person's hand holds a dark blue smartphone, focusing on its vertical triple-camera array. Each lens is encircled by a textured, metallic ring. The blade of a silver utility knife is scraped across the surface of the metallic ring around the middle camera lens. The background is out of focus, with something colorful visible in the top left corner.",
    "Spatial": "An extreme close-up shot frames a smartphone's vertical camera array, which occupies the center of the foreground. In the bottom-left foreground, a person's finger holds the phone steady, though the camera and hand exhibit slight shaking due to natural hand movements. From the top right, the blade of a utility knife extends into the foreground, with its tip pressed against the metallic rings surrounding the middle camera lens in the center of the frame. The knife is scraped against these metallic rings, while an out-of-focus colorful object is visible in the top-left background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
