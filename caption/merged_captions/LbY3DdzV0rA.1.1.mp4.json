  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, showcasing a dramatic scene dominated by a massive weather system. A colossal, brilliantly white cumulonimbus cloud fills most of the frame, positioned in both the middle ground and background against a vivid blue sky. The top of the cloud is bright and puffy, while its flat base is a darker shade of grey. From the base, distinct shafts of heavy rain create a curtain of precipitation, visibly falling in grey sheets into the middle ground. The bottom portion of the frame is filled with a wide, flat expanse of green and brown scrubland stretching from the foreground to the middle ground, with the faint silhouette of distant mountains resting on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky, and uses a deep focus to keep the entire landscape and sky sharp. This is a time-lapse video, greatly accelerating the movement of the clouds and rain. The massive white cumulonimbus cloud billows and churns against the deep blue sky, while the rain sweeps across the landscape below. As the cloud formation drifts slowly from left to right across the frame, the camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, following the movement of the cloud. The video emphasizes the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm, highlighting the grandeur of the natural environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video, greatly accelerating the movement of the clouds and rain. The shot is captured from a low angle, positioned above the ground. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp. Throughout the clip, the camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right.",
    "Subject": "This video showcases a dramatic landscape dominated by a massive weather system. A colossal, brilliantly white cumulonimbus cloud fills the center and upper portion of the frame against a vivid blue sky. The underside of this cloud formation is a flat grey, with distinct shafts of heavy rain creating a curtain of precipitation over the distant terrain. Below, a wide, flat expanse of green and brown scrubland stretches towards a faint line of mountains on the horizon. The video emphasizes the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm, highlighting the grandeur of the natural environment.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse scenery shot. A massive white cumulonimbus cloud billows and churns against a deep blue sky. Rain falls in visible shafts from the cloud's base, sweeping across the green and brown landscape below.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime, outdoor scene, a vast, white cumulonimbus cloud dominates a deep blue sky. The top of the cloud is bright and puffy, while its flat base is a darker shade of grey. From the base of the cloud, a localized downpour of rain is visibly falling in grey sheets. The landscape below is a flat plain covered in green and brown scrubland, with the faint silhouette of distant mountains on the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape. A large cumulonimbus cloud occupies most of the frame, positioned in both the middle ground and background against a blue sky. The cloud's base is in the lower center of the frame, with visible shafts of rain falling into the middle ground. The bottom portion of the frame is filled with a flat expanse of scrubland stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. In the far background, a thin line of mountains rests on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky. As the cloud formation drifts slowly from left to right across the frame, the camera pans from left to right, following the movement of the cloud."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
