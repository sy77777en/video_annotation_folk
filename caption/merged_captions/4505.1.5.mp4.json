  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot where a bright yellow helicopter is positioned in the top center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. It hovers in place, shining a fixed, bright, conical spotlight downward, illuminating a small circular area on the flat, dark ground. Directly below it, a person stands in the bottom center of the frame, also in the middle ground, initially bending down within the beam of light. The person, wearing dark clothing with what seems to be a yellow tie, then stands up, raising their head and hands at their sides to look up at the helicopter, while their whole body sways slightly and casually. A vertical beam of light from the helicopter shines down, connecting the two subjects and illuminating a circular area on the ground. The rest of the frame is filled with a dark, cavernous space that extends into the background, with white smoke rising from the ground around the illuminated figure. The scene is dimly lit, with the spotlight creating a strong contrast between the illuminated area and the surrounding darkness. The helicopter's yellow color becomes apparent as it is more fully illuminated towards the end of the video. A logo is fixed as an overlay at the bottom right corner, displaying a yellow and blue logo of a juice box. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire dark scene sharp, and appears to move slightly backward, subtly pulling away from the figure in the spotlight. The spatial arrangement of all elements remains static, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level, providing a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire dark scene sharp. It appears to move slightly backward, subtly pulling away from the figure in the spotlight.",
    "Subject": "The video is framed as a wide shot, showing a bright yellow helicopter hovering in a dark, misty environment. Its landing skids are visible, and a bright spotlight shines down, illuminating a person standing directly below. The person is wearing dark clothing with what seems to be a yellow tie. Initially, they are looking down, but towards the end, they appear to look up at the helicopter. The scene is dimly lit, with the spotlight creating a strong contrast between the illuminated area and the surrounding darkness, and the helicopter's yellow color becomes apparent as it is more fully illuminated towards the end of the video.",

On the ground below, a person initially bends down within the beam of light, then stands up, raising their head and hands at their sides to look up at the helicopter, while their whole body sways slightly and casually.",
    "Scene": "In a vast, dark, and cavernous environment at night, a helicopter hovers in the upper portion of the scene. It projects a single, bright, conical beam of light downward, illuminating a small circular area on the flat, dark ground. Within this circle of light, a solitary figure stands, surrounded by white smoke rising from the ground. The surrounding space is almost entirely black. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a yellow and blue logo of a juice box.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
