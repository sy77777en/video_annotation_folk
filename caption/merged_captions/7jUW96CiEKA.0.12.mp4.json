  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a herd of buffalo is positioned in the lower one-fourth of the frame in the middle ground, with tall grass occupying the foreground across the bottom of the frame. The buffalo are dark in color, with prominent curved horns and sturdy builds, collectively forming a cohesive group. Trees and hills form the background, visible across the top portion of the frame, suggesting a savanna or grassland habitat. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground where the group of buffalo is situated. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the buffalo in focus while the background and foreground are blurred. The shot remains static throughout the video, with no changes in framing. One buffalo on the right side of the group begins to move forward, seemingly taking a leading position, while another buffalo in the background continues to walk forward, attempting to integrate into the group. The rest of the buffaloes remain mostly stationary as these movements occur. The serene outdoor setting is captured in a grassy savanna, surrounded by lush green trees, with the time of day likely being morning or afternoon, as indicated by the clear visibility and natural light. The tall, dry grass sways gently, suggesting a light breeze, and the scene is calm and natural, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground where a group of buffalo is situated.

    "Subject": "The video features a group of buffalo standing in tall grass. The buffalo are dark in color, with prominent curved horns and sturdy builds. They are closely gathered, facing forward, in a natural environment with trees visible in the background, suggesting a savanna or grassland habitat. The buffalo are the primary subjects, collectively forming a cohesive group.",
    "Motion": "A group of buffaloes is standing in a grassy field with trees in the background. One buffalo on the right side of the group begins to move forward, seemingly taking a leading position.

    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a grassy savanna, surrounded by lush green trees. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as indicated by the clear visibility and natural light. A group of buffalo is prominently featured, standing amidst tall, dry grass that sways gently, suggesting a light breeze. The buffalo are dark in color, contrasting with the pale grass and vibrant greenery of the trees. The scene is calm and natural, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
