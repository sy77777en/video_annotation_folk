  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no single main subject, focusing instead on the expansive landscape. A golden-brown mountain ridge extends from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground, serving as the central path of movement. To the left of the ridge, a dark-water lake is situated in the middle ground. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains occupies the center and right portions of the frame, set against a blue sky with white clouds at the top. The camera, positioned at a low aerial height, moves rapidly forward along the crest of the ridge, creating a significant motion blur effect in the immediate foreground. The dynamic forward shot from a drone features a varied Dutch angle effect due to the steady clockwise roll. The camera maintains a deep focus on the distant snow-capped peaks, keeping them sharp and clear, while the nearby ridge appears slightly blurred from the fast movement and minor barrel distortion. The rapid forward motion emphasizes the swift flight towards the distant mountains, skimming low along the crest of the ridge, creating a dynamic, immersive perspective. The video captures a high-speed flight along the sharp crest of a mountain ridge covered in golden-brown rocks. The rapid forward motion creates a blur in the immediate foreground. To the left of the ridge lies a calm, greenish-blue glacial lake nestled against the base of a large, barren, light-brown mountain. In the background, a dramatic range of jagged, rocky peaks, some covered with white snow and glaciers, stands out against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself.",

    "Camera": "This is a dynamic forward shot from a drone flying over a mountain ridge, featuring a varied Dutch angle effect due to the steady clockwise roll. The camera maintains a deep focus on the distant snow-capped peaks, keeping them sharp and clear, while the nearby ridge appears slightly blurred from the fast movement and minor barrel distortion.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving aerial perspective, flying low along the spine of a steep, golden-brown rocky ridge. To the left, a serene, dark-water lake is nestled at the base of the mountains, while in the distance, a majestic range of jagged, snow-capped peaks rises against a deep blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The video lacks a single main subject, as the sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself. The focus is on the grandeur of the natural world rather than any specific object within it.",
    "Motion": "This is a stunning aerial view of a majestic mountain landscape, where towering snow-capped peaks stand against a blue sky with scattered clouds. A serene lake, located in the middle ground, is positioned to the left of a sharp, golden-brown ridge that dominates the foreground. The camera appears to be flying at high speed, skimming low along the crest of the ridge, creating a dynamic, immersive perspective. The rapid forward movement blurs the foreground, emphasizing the swift flight towards the distant mountains.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
