  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban outdoor scene, capturing a broad view of the environment. The camera, at eye level with a level angle, initially pans right to face the crosswalk, then moves forward to cross the road, offering a dynamic perspective. The scene, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an intersection with pedestrian crossings and a mix of natural and architectural elements. In the foreground, the road occupies the lower portion of the frame, with pedestrian crossings marked clearly. Traffic signals and street signs are positioned near the center-left, slightly elevated in the middle ground. The tall evergreen trees and budding deciduous trees are distributed across the left and right sides of the frame, forming part of the middle ground. A stone wall runs horizontally along the middle ground, separating the road from the background. In the background, a brick building is visible towards the right side of the frame. The sky, overcast and diffused, spans the upper portion of the frame. The camera's height is approximately at eye level, providing a direct view of the scene without significant elevation or depression. The video features noticeable barrel distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward, and uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera is extremely unsteady, shaking intensely throughout. The scene remains tranquil, with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, a stone wall, and a building visible in the distance. The video is a cityscape scenery shot, emphasizing the overall scene and context, highlighting the urban setting, trees, and surrounding architecture rather than a specific object. The sky is overcast, casting a diffused light over the scene, and the road is paved, with clear markings for pedestrian crossings.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the urban setting, trees, and surrounding architecture rather than a specific object. The composition emphasizes the overall scene and context.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a road intersection with a traffic light on a pole, surrounded by trees and a stone wall. The camera moves forward, passing through the intersection via the crosswalk. The scene remains tranquil, with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, a stone wall, and a building visible in the distance.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an outdoor urban setting during the day. The scene features an intersection with pedestrian crossings and a mix of natural and architectural elements. Tall evergreen trees and deciduous trees with budding leaves line the sidewalk, indicating a springtime environment. A stone wall borders the area, and a brick building is visible in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a diffused light over the scene. Traffic signals and street signs are present, adding to the urban atmosphere. The road is paved, with clear markings for pedestrian crossings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
