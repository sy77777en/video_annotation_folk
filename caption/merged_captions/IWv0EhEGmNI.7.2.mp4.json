  "merged_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene is framed by the dark silhouettes of buildings in the left and right middle ground. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of a gun is visible in the lower right corner. In the middle ground, a tall, glowing streetlight stands center-right, illuminating a foggy street. A building with a lit, arched doorway is visible in the left middle ground. As the perspective moves slightly backward and to the left, the camera smoothly pans right and left to survey the surroundings, transitioning from a low angle to a level angle with minimal shaking. A person lying motionless on the ground in the center middle ground and a white sedan parked in the right middle ground become more visible. The view is partially obscured by a dark structure on the right, and as the perspective shifts slightly, the open doorway of a building becomes a focal point. Several on-screen user interface elements are visible: a compass at the top of the screen initially indicates a heading of 111 degrees southeast, but this changes shortly thereafter; an objective in white text reads \"Find Hadir.\" and later updates to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\"; a white waypoint marker on the right is labeled \"Search Church\" with a distance initially showing 93 meters, but soon updating to 94 and 95 meters; and subtitles at the bottom of the screen display dialogue in white, red, and green text. A white crosshair appears in the center of the view. The scene is dimly illuminated by a single, tall streetlamp whose light is diffused by the thick fog, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",

    "Camera": "From a low, first-person perspective, the camera moves backward and leftward while panning right and left to survey the surroundings. The camera angle starts low and transitions to a level angle due to the movement. The motion is smooth with minimal shaking, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective in a video game, a person in dark clothing lies motionless on the ground in a dark, foggy street at night. To the right, a white sedan is parked near a low wall. The scene is illuminated by a single, tall, glowing streetlight. The view is framed by the dark silhouettes of two-story buildings. Several on-screen user interface elements are visible: a compass at the top of the screen initially indicates a heading of 111 degrees southeast, but this changes shortly thereafter; an objective in white text reads \"Find Hadir.\" and later updates to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\"; a white waypoint marker on the right is labeled \"Search Church\" with a distance initially showing 93 meters, but soon updating to 94 and 95 meters; and subtitles at the bottom of the screen display dialogue in white, red, and green text. A white crosshair appears in the center of the view.",
    "Motion": "The video captures an eye-level, first-person perspective where the camera moves backward and to the left, smoothly panning both right and left to survey the surroundings. It transitions from a street scene with a motionless body to focus on the open doorway of a building. The camera angle starts low and gradually shifts to a level angle due to the movement, with minimal shaking. The on-screen objective text updates accordingly.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out onto a dark, foggy street at night. The scene is dimly illuminated by a single, tall streetlamp whose light is diffused by the thick fog. On the left stands a dark, two-story building with an arched doorway that reveals a lit room inside. The view is partially obscured by a dark structure on the right, and as the perspective shifts slightly, a white car and a body on the paved ground become visible further down the street. The scene includes several overlay elements: a compass at the top of the screen, objective text that changes from \"Find Hadir.\" to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\", location markers with distance indicators, and dialogue subtitles at the bottom.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene is framed by the dark silhouettes of buildings in the left and right middle ground. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of a gun is visible in the lower right corner. In the middle ground, a tall, glowing streetlight stands center-right, illuminating a foggy street. A building with a lit, arched doorway is visible in the left middle ground. As the perspective moves slightly backward and to the left, a person lying motionless on the ground in the center middle ground and a white sedan parked in the right middle ground become more visible. Throughout the shot, user interface elements are present: a compass and objective text are at the top center, waypoints are on the left and right sides of the screen, and subtitles are at the bottom. During the movement, the objective text updates, and a white crosshair appears in the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
