  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, Tom the cat, portrayed with a devilish appearance, is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the foreground. His fur is entirely red, except for a white patch on his chest and belly, white hands, and a white muzzle. He has small red horns on his head, a pointed red tail, and wears a red loincloth or trousers. He holds a red, three-pronged trident in his left hand, which initially extends from the bottom right toward the top right of the frame, but as the cat moves his arm, the trident's direction and position change continuously. Tom is depicted wearing a red high-collared cape and a red collar with a gold decoration. An indistinct brown structure is visible in the left background, and there are also scattered bokeh lights in the background. The scene is set against a dark, out-of-focus background illuminated by numerous circular, white bokeh lights. Throughout the shot, Tom gestures with his right hand in the right-center foreground, first raising his open right hand, then lowering it while extending both arms out to his sides with his palms facing up. He concludes by bringing his right hand back up to gesture again, consistently looking in the same direction. His head is slightly turned toward the left of the frame while speaking, and his facial expression is angry and argumentative, with his mouth open and teeth showing. His mouth moves in a speaking motion throughout the action. The camera remains stationary at his level, sharply focusing on the 2D animated character, Tom the red devil cat, against a significantly blurred real-world background, creating a striking visual contrast.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set against a dark, out-of-focus background illuminated by numerous circular, white bokeh lights. An indistinct, brown structure is visible on the left side of the composition. In the foreground, a red, animated cat-like figure holds a matching red, three-pronged trident. The character gestures with its hands, and its facial expression shifts during the sequence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
