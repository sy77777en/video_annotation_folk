  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape at sunset, with the scenery as the main focus. Initially, the upper two-thirds of the frame are occupied by a sky filled with clouds illuminated in warm, golden tones. The lower third of the frame shows a dark silhouette of trees and buildings in the middle ground. The camera, from a low angle, performs a slow pan from left to right across the scene, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. As the camera moves, the bright, setting sun enters the frame from the bottom right, positioned just above the silhouetted treeline. This movement also reveals more of the cityscape, including a distant silhouette of taller buildings and a mountain in the background on the far right. The sky is filled with warm tones of orange, yellow, and gold near the horizon, fading into a darker, dusky blue above. Scattered clouds, tinged with golden light, drift slowly across the expanse. The bright, glowing sun is visible on the horizon, partially obscured by the landscape. A dark silhouette of trees, including palms, and low-rise buildings occupies the middle ground, with some structures catching the last glint of sunlight. In the background, a silhouette of tall buildings and a mountain stands against the colorful sky. The camera maintains a low-angle perspective throughout the shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerges from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, the slightly unsteady camera pans right across a city skyline at sunset. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a vast sky filled with scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues of orange, yellow, and gold by the setting sun. Below, the city is reduced to a dark silhouette of buildings and trees, with the brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic video of a vibrant sunset over a city skyline. The camera performs a slow pan from left to right across the scene. The sky is filled with clouds illuminated in shades of gold and orange by the setting sun, which appears from the bottom-right side of the frame to the bottom-center of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
