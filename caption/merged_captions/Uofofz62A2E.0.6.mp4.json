  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, the main skateboarder positioned in the foreground, slightly right of center, on a light grey step that spans the bottom of the frame. The skateboarder, wearing a pink long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and white shoes, is captured performing tricks near a large dark grey stone monument with bronze statues and white graffiti, including the word \"TORIGANG,\" in the center middle ground. Behind it, a castle-like stone building with twin cylindrical towers is visible. Another man walks in the far right middle ground, and a trash can is to the right of center in the middle ground. The camera starts at ground level with a low angle, looking up at the skateboarder, and trucks left to track them from the side while gradually rising and tilting downward, transitioning to a level angle. The skateboarder moves left along the foreground step, performing a complex trick, possibly an ollie or a kickflip, near the center-left. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder continues moving away from the camera, transitioning from the foreground step to a cobblestone pavement in the middle ground and eventually the background. As he moves into the background, performing another trick in the center of the frame, the surrounding urban plaza becomes more expansive, revealing multi-story European-style buildings framing the left, center, and right background, along with pedestrians, green trees, an orange tram moving from left to center in the background, and a street lamp to the left of center in the background. The camera ceases trucking and pans left to follow their departure. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and deep focus is maintained throughout with a large depth of field. The skateboarder is the central focus, showcasing skill and movement throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera starts at ground level with a low angle, looking up at the skateboarder. It trucks left to track them from the side while gradually rising and tilting downward, transitioning to a level angle. Deep focus is maintained throughout with a large depth of field. As the skateboarder moves away near the end, the camera ceases trucking and pans left to follow their departure. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person skateboarding in an urban setting. The skateboarder, wearing a pink long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and white shoes, is captured performing tricks near a statue and later on a cobblestone area. The individual appears to be male, with short hair, and is actively engaged in skateboarding maneuvers. In the background, there are other people walking, and a tram is visible, indicating a bustling city environment. The skateboarder is the central focus, showcasing skill and movement throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "A man on a skateboard approaches a set of steps and jumps onto them, smoothly gliding to the left side of the frame with a push from his left foot. He performs a complex trick, possibly an ollie or a kickflip, and pushes twice more with his left foot to continue moving left. After successfully jumping off the steps, he makes balancing movements to maintain his stability, rotates the skateboard, and leaves the steps. He then skates onto a square area paved with tiles and continues to glide away from the camera. The background shows a city square with buildings, trees, and other people walking around.",
    "Scene": "The video, an objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective, is filmed with a fisheye lens creating a distorted, wide-angle view of an outdoor urban plaza during daytime under a cloudy sky. A large, dark grey stone monument adorned with bronze statues and bearing white graffiti, including the word \"TORIGANG,\" on its base stands prominently, with a castle-like stone building featuring twin cylindrical towers visible behind it. The plaza features smooth, light grey concrete surfaces, including a curved ledge in the foreground, which transitions to a cobblestone pavement. Multi-story European-style buildings with numerous windows frame the background, where green trees, pedestrians, and an orange tram are also present. A skateboarder is seen moving across these varied surfaces within the plaza.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot, the main skateboarder positioned in the foreground, slightly right of center, on a light grey step that spans the bottom of the frame. To his left and in the center middle ground, a large dark grey stone monument with bronze statues and white graffiti is prominent, with a castle-like stone building featuring twin cylindrical towers visible behind it in the background. Another man walks in the far right middle ground, and a trash can is to the right of center in the middle ground. The skateboarder moves left along the foreground step, performing a trick near the center-left. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder continues moving away from the camera, transitioning from the foreground step to a cobblestone pavement in the middle ground and eventually the background. As he moves into the background, performing another trick in the center of the frame, the surrounding urban plaza becomes more expansive, revealing multi-story European-style buildings framing the left, center, and right background, along with pedestrians, green trees, an orange tram moving from left to center in the background, and a street lamp to the left of center in the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
