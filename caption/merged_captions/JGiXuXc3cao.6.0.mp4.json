  "merged_caption": "A full shot centers on a 2D hand-drawn illustration of a research-style vessel on a choppy sea, positioned in the middle ground, with the water rolling and churning to create whitecaps. The ship features a blue hull, a reddish-brown bottom, and a white, multi-level superstructure. A tall central mast flies a small American flag, with a smaller mast located further aft, and a white crane is positioned on the stern deck. The vessel is surrounded by dark, turbulent water with whitecaps, set against a backdrop of a dark, cloudy sky that fills the top half of the frame. A few rays of sunlight penetrate the clouds, illuminating the vessel and the surface of the sea, breaking through the gaps in the left-center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the ship's height and slowly and smoothly zooms out while the composition remains static throughout the shot, capturing the animated, hand-drawn style of the scene. The ship remains mostly static in place, with the choppy, dark sea extending from the foreground to the background, and the overcast sky with heavy, dark clouds adding to the turbulent conditions. The camera movement reveals the full extent of the scene, emphasizing the contrast between the illuminated vessel and the stormy environment.",

    "Scene": "In an animated, hand-drawn style, a blue and white ship sails on a choppy, dark sea. The sky is overcast with heavy, dark clouds, though beams of sunlight break through to illuminate the vessel. The ship has a blue hull, a white superstructure with multiple decks, and several masts, one of which flies a small American flag. The water is depicted with dark tones and white crests, suggesting turbulent conditions.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot centers on a 2D hand-drawn ship in the middle ground, positioned on a choppy sea that extends from the foreground to the background. A few rays of sunlight break through the gaps in the left-center of the frame, casting light onto the ship and the surface of the sea. A dark, cloudy sky fills the top half of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at the ship's height and slowly and smoothly zooms out while the composition remains static throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
