  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman with dark brown hair styled in an updo, wearing a white top, a large gold statement necklace, and earrings, positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, with the camera at her eye level. Her expression is neutral. In the middle ground, several woven pendant lights hang from the top of the frame, flanking the woman, while vertical rods are visible against a plain, light-colored wall in the background. The setting is indoors in a modern, minimalist space with a neutral color palette, featuring pendant lights casting a soft glow and cage-like woven bamboo objects hanging from black rods, adding an intriguing element to the decor. The environment includes dried floral arrangements, contributing to the clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The lighting is consistent, suggesting an artificial, controlled environment. The camera maintains a level angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman. As the camera moves backward with slight unsteadiness, the woman begins to walk forward towards the camera, maintaining her neutral expression. As she gets closer, she turns to the right and exits the frame, leaving the room empty. The scene then appears out of focus, with the static middle ground and background elements remaining, including the pendant lights and vertical rods, contributing to the calm and composed atmosphere focused on simplicity and elegance.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the woman in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. As the camera moves backward with slight unsteadiness, the woman gradually blurs and eventually exits the frame, causing the scene to appear out of focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with dark brown hair styled in an updo. She is wearing a white top, a large gold statement necklace, and earrings. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The woman gradually disappears from the frame, leaving the scene empty.",
    "Motion": "The woman, wearing a white top and a large gold necklace, begins to walk forward towards the camera in a room with cage-like decorations in the background. Her expression remains neutral. As she gets closer, she turns to the right and exits the frame, leaving the room empty.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors in a modern, minimalist space with a neutral color palette. The environment features a series of pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, casting a soft glow. Black rods, likely part of the set design, are noticeable, from which several woven bamboo cage-like objects are hanging, adding an intriguing element to the decor. The walls are plain and light-colored, contributing to the clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The setting includes a few decorative elements, such as dried floral arrangements, adding a touch of natural texture. The lighting is consistent, suggesting an artificial, controlled environment without any indication of the time of day. The overall atmosphere is calm and composed, with a focus on simplicity and elegance.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, with the camera at her eye level. In the middle ground, several woven pendant lights hang from the top of the frame, flanking the woman. Vertical rods are also visible in the middle ground, set against a plain wall in the background. The woman then moves to the right, exiting the frame and leaving a static scene of the empty middle ground and background elements."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
