  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot focusing on two women engaged in a cooking activity in a home dining area. The woman in white, positioned centrally in the frame, wears a white short-sleeved blouse with yellow patterns and a beige skirt with black patterns. She has her hair styled in a bun with straight bangs and appears relatively young. Her counterpart, dressed in a blue top, is situated on the right side of the frame, in the foreground, with only half of her upper body shown. The camera is positioned at the women's height, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the woman in white in the midground. The bowl of noodles they are working on is located in the middle ground in the lower left corner. In the lower left corner of the foreground, there is a wooden cutting board with a small knife and red chili peppers on it. The background consists of a shelving unit filled with books and pens, situated behind the women. The woman in white stands next to a table, observing the bowl of noodles, smiles, tilts her head slightly to the left, and gestures towards the bowl while speaking. Meanwhile, the woman in blue, who seems slightly older and has shoulder-length hair with straight bangs, uses chopsticks to add chili to the noodles. The camera remains completely static throughout, capturing the collaborative cooking process without any noticeable movement or transition. The environment features a wooden countertop with various ingredients, including sliced red peppers and leafy greens, and a bowl with a colorful dish prominently placed on the counter. The lighting appears artificial, making it difficult to determine the time of day, but the overall scene remains warm and inviting, with a focus on culinary activity.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
