  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a low-angle, extreme wide shot of the monumental Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík, Iceland. The church's tall, tapered concrete tower, featuring a distinctive stepped design of vertical columns, is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a dark statue of Leif Erikson stands on a large pedestal. The camera smoothly moves forward while tilting upward, capturing the full height of the magnificent tower and transitioning to a wide shot. During this movement, the statue in the foreground moves out of the frame, leaving the central church tower as the sole focus, framed against a backdrop of a cloudy, overcast sky filled with white clouds. The building is constructed from grey concrete, with a distinctive, tiered design that emulates natural rock formations, culminating in a tall, pointed spire with a clock face near its peak. A series of small windows runs down the front facade. The time-lapse video captures the towering church from a low angle at eye level, offering a unique perspective that enhances the visual impact. The focus of the video is on the environment and architectural scale rather than a specific subject, using the camera's movement to convey the immense height and imposing presence of the structure against the overcast sky. The shot includes a motion blur, indicating camera movement, and maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire structure sharp.",

    "Motion": "This scenic shot features the iconic Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík, Iceland, with its distinctive, stepped concrete facade tapering towards a sharp spire. In the foreground, a statue of Leif Erikson stands before the church, all set against a backdrop of a cloudy, overcast sky. The camera moves forward and tilts upward, capturing the full height of the magnificent tower.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime scene captures the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík, Iceland, set against a sky filled with white clouds. The view is directed upward toward the tall, tapered concrete tower, which features a distinctive stepped design of vertical columns. A clock is visible near the spire, and a series of small windows runs down the front facade. In front of the church, a dark statue of a figure is positioned on a pedestal.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
