  "merged_caption": "A man and a woman are framed in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame throughout the scene. The man has light skin and long, curly, blonde hair, wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a ruffled shirt, a dark bowtie, and a boutonniere with a light pink flower. The woman has light skin and long, straight, blonde hair, wearing a light-colored top with a corsage on her wrist. They slow dance, swaying gently in a close embrace with their hands clasped. The camera, positioned at a low angle between hip and eye level, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the couple dancing in the foreground. It performs a smooth counterclockwise arc around them, initially capturing the side of both the man and the woman. As the camera moves, it reveals the man's back, then his profile, and eventually returns to a side view of the couple as they are about to kiss. In the dimly lit indoor setting, large, soft red lights are visible at the top of the frame, while shiny, star-shaped decorations hang from the ceiling. A cluster of smaller, colorful lights—yellow, blue, and white—appears in the background, shifting position from left to right as the camera orbits the central couple. The scene is enveloped in a hazy, atmospheric glow, dominated by several large, soft red lights that rotate in and out of the frame as the camera moves around the couple. They briefly pull back to look into each other's eyes before leaning in to share a kiss at the end of the video, continuing to sway together in the dimly lit space.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a couple slow dances under hanging, shiny, star-shaped decorations. The scene is enveloped in a hazy, atmospheric glow, dominated by several large, soft red lights that rotate in and out of the frame as the camera moves around the couple. A rotating array of three lights—yellow, blue, and white—adds to the ambiance, positioned close together in the background. The camera gracefully circles the couple as they sway gently in the center of the space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
