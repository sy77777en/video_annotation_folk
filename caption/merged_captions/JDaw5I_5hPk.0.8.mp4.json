  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a turbulent seascape, viewed from an overhead perspective. A dark, moss-covered rock is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground. Turbulent ocean water, a mix of blue-green hues, fills the surrounding frame, extending from the foreground to the background. Waves surge dynamically across the frame, primarily from the bottom and sides, breaking against and washing over the centrally located rock. This interaction generates significant white foam, which is most prominent in the foreground and middle ground as it engulfs and recedes from the rock. The rock remains static, providing a fixed point against the continuous, energetic motion of the water. The camera is positioned at a high angle above the water, looking down at the waves crashing over rocks. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the rocks and the surrounding water in focus. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The video captures a daytime seascape of turbulent ocean water vigorously crashing against a prominent, dark rock. The rock, irregular in shape and with a rough texture, displays patches of green on its dark surface. Waves of turquoise and deeper blue water surge around and break over the rock, generating significant white foam and spray in a continuous, dynamic motion. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the dynamic and atmospheric display of natural forces, highlighting the raw power and texture of the sea. From an overhead perspective, foamy white water surges and breaks over the irregular, partially submerged rock, contrasting with the surrounding blue-green hues of the turbulent ocean, creating a scene of constant motion.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a coastal nature scenery shot, capturing ocean waves crashing against a dark, moss-covered rock, with seawater partially covering the rock. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the dynamic and atmospheric display of natural forces, highlighting the raw power and texture of the sea. From an overhead perspective, foamy white water surges and breaks over the irregular, partially submerged rock, contrasting with the surrounding blue-green hues of the turbulent ocean, creating a scene of constant motion.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a series of waves crashing against a dark, jagged rock formation in the ocean. The waves are turbulent and create white foam as they hit the rocks, splashing water around the rock. The rock remains stationary while the water continuously moves and crashes against it, creating a dynamic and powerful scene.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a daytime seascape of turbulent ocean water vigorously crashing against a prominent, dark rock.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
