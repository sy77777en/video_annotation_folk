  "merged_caption": "This over-the-shoulder shot positions a woman's out-of-focus head and shoulder in the foreground on the left side of the frame. The main subject, a man with curly dark hair wearing a grey t-shirt and patterned blue and grey shorts, is in focus in the middle ground, centered within the frame and captured in a medium shot. He is positioned in front of a black power rack, which is part of the background. In the background, a colorful mural composed of red, yellow, and black abstract patterns spans the wall behind him, with a light-colored wooden pegboard mounted to his left, marked with the words \"EAST WEST\" stenciled vertically in black. The man initiates movement by lifting a barbell loaded with black bumper plates featuring white lettering vertically from his waist to his shoulders, then lowers it and repeats the motion, all while remaining in the center of the frame. The woman in the foreground, with dark hair tied back in a ponytail and wearing a dark tank top, remains mostly still with her back to the camera. The camera, positioned at a low, hip-level angle, captures this over-the-shoulder perspective, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the man lifting weights in the midground in focus. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, and the scene is set in an indoor gym.",

    "Camera": "From a low, hip-level angle, the camera captures an over-the-shoulder perspective, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the man lifting weights in the midground in focus. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady.",
    "Subject": "The video shows two people in a gym setting. In the foreground, out of focus and seen from behind, is a woman with dark hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a dark tank top. The primary focus is on a man in the middle ground, framed in a medium shot. He has curly dark hair, is wearing a grey t-shirt and patterned blue and grey shorts. He is actively lifting a barbell with weights, bringing it from a lower position up to his shoulders.",
    "Motion": "A man in a gym lifts a barbell from his thighs up to his shoulders. He then lowers the barbell back to his thighs before lifting it again to his shoulders, where he holds it in a racked position. A woman in the foreground remains mostly still, with her back to the camera.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is an indoor gym. A man performs a weightlifting exercise with a barbell in front of a vibrant wall mural composed of red, yellow, and black abstract patterns. The man is positioned within a black metal power rack. Behind him, a light-colored wooden pegboard is mounted on the wall, marked with the words \"EAST WEST\" stenciled vertically in black. The barbell is loaded with black bumper plates that also feature white lettering.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
