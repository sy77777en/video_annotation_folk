  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a round, textured metal manhole cover positioned in the center middle ground of the frame, set into the asphalt surface of a city street intersection during the daytime. The surrounding street surface occupies the lower foreground and middle ground, with white crosswalk lines visible, and building corners with large windows in the background at the top of the frame. The camera is initially positioned at ground level above the manhole cover, focusing on it with a high angle, looking down. The cover features a grid pattern and several small bolt holes. As the camera cranes down smoothly below the surface, transitioning underground, the perspective shifts to view the scene from below the manhole cover. This reveals the second subject, a bomb, framed in a full shot in the center middle ground, attached to the underside of the manhole cover, which is now above it. The bomb device consists of several red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks, held by metal bands and connected by red, blue, and green wires to a central timer unit with a green digital display showing numbers. The dark space below the cover forms the background. The camera angle shifts to a low angle, looking up, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground, emphasizing the bomb's details and the timer. The motion is primarily downward with an upward tilt, and it moves slightly forward near the end. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking, highlighting the concealed nature of the device beneath the manhole cover.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up of a round, textured metal manhole cover on a paved surface, featuring a grid pattern and several bolt holes. As the scene transitions, the focus shifts to the underside of the manhole cover, revealing a device attached to it. This device consists of several red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks, connected by colorful wires to a digital timer displaying numbers. The transition highlights the concealed nature of the device beneath the manhole cover.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a metal manhole cover on a paved surface, with a building in the background. As the camera moves down and tilts upward, the underside of the manhole cover is shown, revealing a bomb device attached to it. The bomb device consists of several red cylindrical objects connected by wires to a digital timer displaying numbers. The camera focuses on the bomb device, emphasizing its details and the timer.",
    "Scene": "The video opens with a ground-level view of a circular, rusted metal manhole cover set into the asphalt surface of a city street intersection during the daytime. The cover features a textured grid pattern and several small holes. White crosswalk lines are visible on the street, and multi-story buildings with large windows form the background corner. The perspective then shifts to an overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft, revealing a bomb attached to the underside of the cover. The device consists of multiple red dynamite sticks held by metal bands, connected by red, blue, and green wires to a central timer unit with a green digital display showing numbers.",

The dark space below the cover forms the background. The camera is positioned below this second subject, looking up."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
