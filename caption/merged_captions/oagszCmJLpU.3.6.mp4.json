  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape with no primary subject. A flat prairie occupies a small portion of the bottom, stretching from the foreground to the background horizon. The sky dominates most of the frame, filled with dark, turbulent clouds in striking shades of teal and gray, while hints of light touch their upper edges. Heavy, dark clouds are present in both the middle ground and the background of the sky, while a curtain of heavy rain falls in the background, centered along the horizon. Lighter, pink-tinged clouds are visible at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up toward the sky, and is fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing a greatly accelerated time-lapse of the storm. The deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the grassy field to the distant clouds, sharp. The scene captures the slow, powerful movement of the storm system as it unfolds over the vast, flat grassland. In the distance, sheets of rain fall from the base of the clouds, creating a hazy curtain over the horizon. The land is an expansive, flat prairie covered in yellowish-green grass, stretching out to a distant, unbroken horizon. The focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the powerful, atmospheric mood created by the impending storm over the open plains. The clouds are a deep, moody teal and gray, with their upper edges catching a soft pink and white light, creating a stark contrast against the darkness. Below the heavy cloud cover, a curtain of rain falls in the distance, illuminated by a diffuse, greenish-white light that breaks through the gloom.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video of a storm. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, positioned at a low angle between eye-level and overhead, looking up at the sky. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the grassy field to the distant clouds, sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a vast, ominous sky filled with turbulent storm clouds. The clouds are a deep, moody teal and gray, with their upper edges catching a soft pink and white light, creating a stark contrast against the darkness. Below the heavy cloud cover, a curtain of rain falls in the distance, illuminated by a diffuse, greenish-white light that breaks through the gloom. The land is an expansive, flat prairie covered in yellowish-green grass, stretching out to a distant, unbroken horizon. There is no main subject in the composition; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the environment and the powerful, atmospheric mood created by the impending storm over the open plains.",
    "Motion": "This is a dramatic, wide-angle view of a powerful storm over a vast, flat grassland. The sky is dominated by dark, turbulent clouds with striking shades of teal and gray, while hints of light touch their upper edges. In the distance, a curtain of heavy rain falls onto the plains. The scene captures the slow, powerful movement of the storm system.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat prairie under a dramatic, turbulent sky. Heavy storm clouds, colored in shades of dark gray and deep teal, dominate the view, with lighter, pink-tinged areas visible at the top. In the distance, sheets of rain fall from the base of the clouds, creating a hazy curtain over the horizon. The ground is a wide expanse of green and yellow grass that stretches out to meet the storm.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape with no primary subject. A flat prairie occupies a small portion of the bottom, stretching from the foreground to the background horizon. The sky dominates most of the frame. Heavy, dark clouds are present in both the middle ground and the background of the sky, while a curtain of rain falls in the background, centered along the horizon. Lighter clouds are visible at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up toward the sky. The camera appears fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
