  "merged_caption": "The frame presents two static, medium close-up shots simultaneously. The main shot features a woman with curly hair in a yellow shirt with floral designs, positioned in the center foreground, in a room with plain walls visible in the background. Initially, she displays a neutral expression that transitions to concern and then to a sad expression, as if she is on the verge of tears, with her body beginning to heave. A smaller, secondary video feed is overlaid in the bottom-right corner of the screen, displaying a second woman with straight hair and bangs, wearing a gray sweater over a white shirt, who is centered in the foreground of her own frame. In her background, string lights are visible to the left, and a fairly large painting hangs on the wall behind her. She appears attentive and engaged, continuously speaking and occasionally pausing to await a response from the woman in the yellow shirt. The camera for both subjects is captured at their eye level, from a slightly low angle, with a deep focus on the women. The setting suggests a digital communication context, with no significant movement from either subject. The video is a recording of a computer screen with two split-screen windows, one larger main screen and one smaller inset window, showing a virtual conversation between two individuals. The setting is indoors, with one person in a room featuring plain walls and soft lighting, suggesting a casual, home environment. The other individual appears in a smaller inset window, possibly in a different location with dim lighting. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests it could be evening. The overall scene focuses on the interaction between the two individuals, highlighting the digital communication aspect.",

    "Camera": "This video is presented in a split-screen format, featuring two separate static frames. Both frames are filmed from a low, eye-level angle with a deep focus on the women.",
    "Subject": "The video features two women on a video call. The main subject is a woman with curly hair, wearing a yellow shirt with floral designs. She occupies the entire screen and appears to be in a neutral or slightly concerned expression. In the bottom-right corner, a smaller video overlay shows another woman with straight hair and bangs, wearing a gray sweater over a white shirt. Her expression seems attentive or engaged. This overlay covers about 25% of the screen, partially blocking the view of the woman in yellow. The setting suggests a digital communication context.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
