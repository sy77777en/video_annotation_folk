  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the composition focusing on the scenery. A flat, reddish-brown expanse of ground occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground and stretches to the background. The majority of the frame, from the middle ground to the background, is filled by a vast sky. A large, dark grey storm cloud system stretches horizontally across the frame, positioned above the low horizon. Above this dark grey formation, lighter gray clouds fill the center and upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low height and pans from left to right, looking up at the sky. This is a time-lapse video, played at a greatly accelerated speed, capturing the rapid movement of storm clouds. Throughout the shot, the clouds are in motion in a time-lapse effect; the dark grey, low-hanging cloud mass churns in the lower part, while the upper, lighter parts of the formation move and shift across the frame. The shot is framed from a low angle, with the camera height positioned between eye-level and overhead-level. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the ground in the foreground to the distant clouds, sharp and clear. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system. These dark, ominous clouds form a distinct shelf-like structure that stretches across the horizon, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. The scene highlights the contrast between the ominous clouds and the reddish-brown ground below. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening as the clouds obscure direct sunlight. There are no visible structures, vegetation, or people, and the horizon remains low and uninterrupted, emphasizing the vastness of the sky.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system. These dark, ominous clouds form a distinct shelf-like structure that stretches across the horizon, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. Below, a flat, reddish-brown expanse of earth provides a stark, empty foreground that accentuates the sheer size and power of the weather formation, making the storm itself the central element of the scene.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dramatic sky filled with swirling storm clouds over a flat, open landscape. The scene highlights the contrast between the ominous clouds and the reddish-brown ground below. The motion in the video is primarily in the movement of the clouds.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a wide, open outdoor landscape with a flat, reddish-brown ground stretching across the bottom of the scene. Above, the sky is filled with large, dense storm clouds in varying shades of gray and blue, with some areas appearing darker and more turbulent. The clouds move and shift, creating a sense of changing weather, while the horizon remains low and uninterrupted, emphasizing the vastness of the sky. There are no visible structures, vegetation, or people, and the lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening as the clouds obscure direct sunlight. No overlays or additional visual elements are present.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
