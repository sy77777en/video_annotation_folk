  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme close-up shot, filling the frame with a small, rectangular electronic component and the fingers holding it. The component is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the middle ground. Some fingers, including the thumb, are in the foreground, while others remain in the middle ground. The background is out of focus and contains some colorful elements. The component’s metallic surface and the blue-detailed window are clearly visible. The camera remains stationary, focusing on the small electronic component held between a person's thumb and index finger. The hand makes slight movements, subtly shifting the device. This is a static, extreme close-up shot. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the small electronic component with the blue beads in the midground. A person's light-skinned fingers hold a small, rectangular electronic component. The component consists of a black plastic frame with a silver-colored, brushed metal plate on top. Set into this plate is a small, recessed, rounded-square window with a black border. Inside this window are dozens of tiny, bright blue spheres, tightly packed together. The video focuses closely on a small, metallic electronic component with a rectangular shape and rounded edges. The component features a shiny silver surface with a smooth texture, interrupted by a small, glass-covered window displaying a blue, patterned detail inside. The surrounding area includes a matte black material with a slightly rough texture, likely part of the device’s casing. Human fingers are visible, holding the component gently, with natural skin tones and fine lines apparent. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and the blue detail within the window. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",

The background is out of focus and contains some colorful elements. The component’s metallic surface and the blue-detailed window are clearly visible. There is no significant movement or change in shot size between the frames; the spatial arrangement remains stable, with the component and fingers maintaining their positions relative to the frame and each other."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
