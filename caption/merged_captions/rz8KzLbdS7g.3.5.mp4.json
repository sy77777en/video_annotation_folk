  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a quiet residential street, focusing on the scenery rather than specific subjects. The camera captures the street from a first-person perspective, positioned at eye level. In the initial frame, the street runs from the bottom center to the middle ground, flanked by traditional Japanese houses on the left that extend into the background, and a tall lattice-patterned wall on the right. Utility poles and wires crisscross the top of the frame, adding an urban element. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward while subtly trucking from the center to the right side of the street, with occasional pans to the left, maintaining the street's central position while the houses and wall shift slightly to the left and right edges, respectively. The road curves slightly to the right, leading to a small intersection marked by a round traffic mirror in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The clear blue sky forms the background, enhancing the serene atmosphere. The focus is deep, maintaining clarity across the scene, and the movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, inviting viewers to appreciate the overall ambiance rather than a specific object. The setting is outdoors on a clear day, with a bright blue sky overhead. The street is narrow, bordered by traditional Japanese houses with sloping tiled roofs and neatly trimmed greenery. A tall, lattice-patterned wall runs along one side, while utility poles and wires crisscross above, adding to the urban landscape. The road is paved and clean, with no visible pedestrians or vehicles, emphasizing the serene atmosphere of the neighborhood.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
