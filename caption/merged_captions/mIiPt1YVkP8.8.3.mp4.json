  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, frames an aircraft's flight management computer, which predominantly occupies the middle ground of the frame. In the bottom left foreground, a blurred joystick is visible. A hand is positioned in the left middle ground, its fingers moving across the keyboard located in the lower portion of the unit. The rectangular screen, positioned in the upper center of the console, initially displays green text. As the hand interacts with the keys, the screen turns black before refreshing to show different green text, displaying a list of arrival and approach data. A small white knob is visible on the right side of the unit, below the screen. The high-angle shot focuses on the Flight Management Computer in the midground, using a shallow depth of field. The unsteady camera slowly zooms in on the device. A person's light-skinned hand operates the keyboard of an aircraft's Flight Management Computer. The beige-colored control unit features a small, rectangular screen above an alphanumeric keyboard with various function buttons. Initially, the screen displays green text, but as the hand presses a button, it turns black and subsequently illuminates again with different text, showing arrival and approach information for \"KLAX,\" including a list of STARs like \"BASE13\" and \"BUFIE1\" and ILS approaches such as \"ILS06L\" and \"ILS07R.\" Inside a dimly lit aircraft cockpit, the close-up shot focuses on a flight management computer console. The beige metallic unit features a physical keypad with black buttons and a small, white control knob. A hand interacts with the keypad, causing the initial green text on the screen to briefly disappear, resulting in a black screen before different glowing green text appears. The display shows a list of arrival and approach procedures for KLAX, including various waypoints and instrument landing system (ILS) options for different runways.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
