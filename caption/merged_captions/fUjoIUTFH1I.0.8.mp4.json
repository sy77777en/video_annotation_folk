  "merged_caption": "This wide shot frames a city street from behind a large, grey, textured part of a building that occupies the right foreground. In the middle ground, a grey sedan is parked in front of a black coupe toward the center of the frame. The street, lined with multi-story brick buildings on the left, recedes into the background. A person in white clothing, located behind the black car on the left side of the middle ground, exits the frame from the left, while another person in the center of the middle ground moves from right to left. The camera moves slowly and smoothly from right to left at an eye-level position, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire street scene sharp. The video primarily captures a scenic view of a narrow street, with the camera revealing more of the street scene as it moves. While two pedestrians walk on the sidewalk, they are not the main focus of the frame. The scene features parked cars lining the street, enhancing the urban atmosphere. The street is lined with multi-story buildings featuring a mix of red, beige, blue, green, and brown brick facades. On the left, a red brick building with white-trimmed windows sits beside a green one. The overall atmosphere is urban and slightly overcast, with muted, desaturated lighting suggesting an overcast sky or deep shade cast by the tall structures. Three cars are visible along the street, with metal grates detailing the road. The scene is set during the day, with the buildings and cars being the primary focus of this scenery shot.",

    "Scene": "A view down a paved city street is framed by a large, grey, textured part of a building in the right foreground. Multi-story buildings with aged brick and painted facades line the alley. On the left, a red brick building with white-trimmed windows sits beside a green one. A black coupe is parked in front of a grey sedan along the left side of the road, which is detailed with metal grates. The scene is set during the day, with muted, desaturated lighting suggesting an overcast sky or deep shade cast by the tall structures.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
