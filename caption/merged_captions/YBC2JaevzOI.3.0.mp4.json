  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person's hand and forearm are positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame. The hand is silhouetted and slightly curled with the palm facing upward, suggesting they are lying on a dark, textured surface. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground hand, and remains static throughout the shot. In the middleground, a dark car with illuminated red taillights is visible on a dark, gravelly road, set against the dark sky in the background. The road is lined with dark trees, enhancing the nighttime setting. The car proceeds to drive away from the camera, its lights receding into the distance until they disappear behind the curled fingers of the hand in the foreground. As the car moves away, its taillights gradually vanish, leaving the road in darkness. The person in the foreground remains completely still, lying on the ground, while the camera maintains a level angle from a ground-level perspective.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, ground-level shot with a level angle. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground hand.",
    "Subject": "From a level perspective, a person's hand and forearm are visible in the foreground, suggesting they are lying on a dark, textured surface. The hand is silhouetted and slightly curled with the palm facing upward. In the distant, out-of-focus background, a dark car is seen driving away down a road at night, with its two red taillights illuminated.",
    "Motion": "A car with its red taillights illuminated drives away down a road at night, receding into the distance until it is no longer visible. In the foreground, a person remains completely still, lying on the ground.",
    "Scene": "At night, from a low perspective on a dark, gravelly road, a silhouetted hand is visible in the foreground. Further down the road, which is lined with dark trees, a vehicle's red taillights are illuminated. The vehicle proceeds to drive away, its lights receding into the distance until they vanish, leaving the road in darkness.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a person's hand and forearm are positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame. In the middleground, a car with illuminated red taillights is visible on a road, set against the dark sky in the background. The car proceeds to drive away from the camera, its lights receding into the distance until they disappear behind the curled fingers of the hand in the foreground. The hand and the camera remain stationary throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
