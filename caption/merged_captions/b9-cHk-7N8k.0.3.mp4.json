  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man with dark, curly, medium-length hair and a full beard is shown surfing, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is wearing a long-sleeved, black wetsuit and is barefoot, standing on a blue surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame into the foreground. The wave and its white spray flank him on the left and right. In the background, a sandy shoreline with trees and buildings is visible on the right side of the frame, with the sunset sky, a warm orange glow fading into a pale blue, occupying the upper portion. The camera, mounted on the surfboard, captures a slightly unsteady, above-water shot of the surfer, leading him from the front. It moves backward while simultaneously trucking right and panning left. The camera angle begins level and tilts slightly upward to a low angle, with a varying Dutch angle created as the camera rolls slightly clockwise and then counterclockwise. During this motion, the camera keeps a deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp. The surfer maintains a crouched stance with his knees bent and arms extended to his sides for balance as he rides the wave. His body is angled, and he is looking forward in the direction he is moving. The surfboard glides across the water's surface, cutting through the wave and sending spray into the air as he moves forward. As the camera rolls, the background shoreline moves from left to right, enhancing the dynamic motion of the scene.",

    "Subject": "A man with dark, curly, medium-length hair and a full beard is shown surfing. He is wearing a long-sleeved, black wetsuit and is barefoot.

    "Motion": "A man in a wetsuit rides a wave on a surfboard, maintaining a crouched stance with his knees bent and arms held out to his sides for balance. The surfboard glides across the water's surface, cutting through the wave and sending spray into the air as he moves forward.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted to a surfboard captures a person surfing on a wave in the ocean. The scene takes place at sunset, with a warm orange glow on the horizon fading into a pale blue sky. The blue, textured surface of the surfboard cuts through the water, creating white sea spray. In the distance, a sandy shoreline with trees and buildings is visible. The surfer, wearing a full-body black wetsuit, stands barefoot on the board, balanced on the moving wave.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a surfer is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame into the foreground. The wave and its white spray are in the middle ground, flanking the surfer on the left and right. In the background, a shoreline is visible on the right side of the frame, with the sunset sky occupying the upper portion. The camera, mounted on the surfboard, captures the surfer's ride as it moves backward, simultaneously trucking right and panning left. During this motion, the camera also rolls slightly clockwise before rolling counterclockwise, causing the background shoreline to move from left to right as the surfer rides the wave."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
