  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot at dusk, a seagull with a white body and head, grey wings with black tips, and a yellow beak with a red spot is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, descending towards the bottom with its pinkish-red legs extended downwards. The middle ground is occupied by the dark blue sea, extending to the background with choppy, white-crested waves, creating a sense of depth. A shadowy cliff face is visible on the horizon under a pale sky. The seagull flies down, landing on a dark rock located in the bottom center foreground. Upon landing, it stands with its wings partially spread out to its sides. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, tracks the bird as it lands, tilting down and panning to the right, which shifts the perspective from a level to a high angle. The slightly unsteady, above-water shot with a shallow depth of field keeps the seagull in focus. As the camera tracks the seagull after it lands, the bird remains positioned at the center of the frame, standing on the rock.",

    "Scene": "At dusk, a seagull with white and grey plumage lands on a dark rock in the foreground, its wings spread as it touches down.

The middle ground is occupied by the sea, and a cliff is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The seagull lands on a rock located in the bottom center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
