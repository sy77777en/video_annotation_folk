  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents two silhouetted figures resembling young boys against a hazy, monochromatic setting. A figure with large, round, glowing white eyes is positioned slightly left of center, running toward the right side of the frame across uneven, black, silhouetted ground. Another figure, also a black silhouette but without glowing eyes, enters from the left holding a thin, straight object similar to a stick and slowly follows the first figure. The scene is set in a side-view gaming video with a dark, monochromatic landscape, where large, indistinct vertical structures are heavily obscured by a thick gray fog or mist, creating a hazy atmosphere. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level in this 2D animation, smoothly zooms out and moves to the right, following the two silhouetted figures as they run from left to right across the terrain, keeping both figures within the frame as they move.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the camera smoothly zooms out and moves to the right, following the two silhouetted figures.",
    "Subject": "The video features two figures resembling young boys, both presented as completely black silhouettes. The boy on the right has large, round, glowing white eyes, which are his only visible facial feature. The second boy, positioned to the left, is also a black silhouette but does not have glowing eyes. This second figure is holding a thin, straight object, similar to a stick, in his hand.",
    "Motion": "Two silhouetted figures run from left to right across uneven ground. The leading figure has glowing white eyes, while the second figure, following closely behind, holds a thin stick.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video with a dark, monochromatic landscape, the scene features an uneven, black, silhouetted ground. Large, indistinct vertical structures are heavily obscured by a thick gray fog or mist, creating a hazy atmosphere. Two small, silhouetted figures of boys are visible; one on the right with glowing white eyes runs across the terrain, while another figure is positioned on the left.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot presents two silhouetted figures against a hazy, monochromatic setting. A figure with glowing eyes is positioned slightly left of center, running toward the right side of the frame. Another figure, holding a stick, enters from the left and slowly follows the first figure. The camera gradually zooms out while moving to the right, keeping both figures within the frame as they move. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level in this 2D animation."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
