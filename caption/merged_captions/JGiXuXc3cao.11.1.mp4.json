  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, an older, light-skinned man with white, combed-back hair is positioned on the right side of the frame, wearing a gray suit jacket over a white collared shirt. He holds the bottom of a large, rectangular photograph in the center-left foreground with his left hand, while pointing with his right index finger to the center of the image, which features a dark, vertical, rectangular object with mottled green and dark texturing on its surface, set against a solid teal background. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in and rolls clockwise, focusing on the animated man as he points at the picture. In the blurred background of the room, which is rendered in a hand-drawn style with brown-toned walls, the dark silhouette of a multi-tiered structure is visible in the center, and a chair is visible on the left. The camera is positioned at the man's eye level, capturing the static, animated illustration of the older man, who remains motionless throughout the clip.",

    "Subject": "An older, light-skinned man with white, combed-back hair is depicted in profile, looking toward the left. He wears a gray suit jacket over a white collared shirt. With his left hand, he holds the bottom of a large, rectangular photograph, while his right hand is raised, pointing with his index finger at the center of the image. The photograph itself has a teal-colored background and shows a dark, vertical, rectangular object with some mottled green and dark texturing on its surface.",
    "Motion": "This video shows a static, animated illustration of an older man. He holds a photograph with his left hand and points to a detail on it with his right index finger. There is no movement from the subject in the clip.",
    "Scene": "In an animated indoor setting with brown-toned walls, an older man with white hair, dressed in a grey suit, holds a rectangular photograph. He points his finger at a dark, vertical object depicted in the photo, which is set against a solid teal background. In the blurred background of the room, the dark silhouette of a multi-tiered structure is visible. The scene is rendered in a hand-drawn style.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, an older man is positioned on the right side of the frame. He holds a large photograph in the center-left foreground, pointing with his right index finger to the center of the image.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
