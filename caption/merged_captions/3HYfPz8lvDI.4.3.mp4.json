  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot, captured from a bird's-eye view, looking down into an open, light brown cardboard box that occupies the majority of the frame. Positioned in the center of the box and the frame is a stack of white papers. The top paper, a news article, is the central focus. Its title, \"London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building,\" is at the top center of the paper. Below the title, on the top left of the paper, are the date \"2 September 2015\" and \"386 Comments,\" with a small red square icon just below them. A large color photograph is centrally located on the paper, depicting the London skyline under a blue sky with scattered white clouds; the Walkie Talkie building (20 Fenchurch Street) is prominent within this photo, slightly left of its center, alongside other skyscrapers, including the Gherkin (30 St Mary Axe), with the River Thames in the foreground. The byline \"THOMAS LANE\" is in the bottom left corner of this photograph, prominently displayed as the author’s credit. The article text is printed below the photograph, occupying the bottom portion of the paper. An overlay with white text is consistently visible in the bottom left corner of the frame: \"[19] - BBC - London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building (2015)\". The camera is positioned at a bird's-eye view angle, looking down, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the midground where the newspaper article is visible. The camera movement is very smooth, rolling clockwise while simultaneously moving downwards. The camera gradually zooms in on the article, bringing the text and images into clearer focus. The scene remains static throughout, with the camera's smooth motion enhancing the visibility of the article's details.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
