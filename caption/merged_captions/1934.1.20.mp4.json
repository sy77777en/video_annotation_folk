  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of four individuals in white protective suits, with the camera positioned at their level. The group occupies the foreground and middle ground, with three individuals positioned slightly to the right of center, visible only from the chest up, facing a screen in the center. The fourth individual, wearing a red top hat with a small brown band around the base, is depicted from the waist up and stands slightly behind and to the right of the seated group, also facing the screen. The screen itself is centrally located in the background, displaying a small white figure against a dark backdrop. The man in the red hat turns his head to the left and begins speaking to the group. The screen in front of them displays a small, white figure that starts to move. Throughout the sequence, the standing individual turns his head towards the camera briefly before returning his gaze to the screen. The video features a static camera positioned at eye level with a level angle. It employs shallow focus on the middle ground, creating a more selective depth of field. The setting is a stark, minimalist indoor environment with a monochromatic color scheme dominated by white, devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the screen and the individuals' interaction with it. In the background on the far right of the frame, there is a blurred white laboratory apparatus. The overall atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects within the frame. The overall composition maintains a consistent focus on the group's interaction with the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
