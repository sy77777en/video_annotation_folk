  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a Black man with dark, braided hair, positioned in the foreground of the frame, wearing a light-colored, horizontally striped t-shirt with the words \"AMERICA RECYCLES\" and a graphic printed on the chest, and an unzipped dark jacket with a lighter, patterned lining visible on the left side. He is accessorized with a beaded choker-style necklace, another chain, earrings in both ears, rings on both hands—with a ring on the right ring finger and rings on the left ring and pinky fingers—and a gold-colored bracelet on his left wrist. He has a grill on his teeth. The setting is a dark outdoor area at night, illuminated by a single, warm light source that casts a yellow-orange glow, with the ground appearing to be dirt and the surrounding area obscured by deep shadows, while the lower bodies of some people are visible in the background. The camera is at his level with a shallow depth of field focused on him. The man brings a lit cigarette or cigarillo to his mouth and inhales. As he leans his upper body backward until he is nearly lying down, the camera smoothly cranes up in an arc, transitioning from a level angle to a bird's-eye view. This transition reframes the scene into a medium close-up, with the man's head and torso now occupying the center of the frame as the camera shifts to a position above him. He exhales a plume of white smoke upward with his mouth open, looking upwards into the dimly lit air.",

    "Camera": "This shot begins at an eye-level, level angle, with a shallow depth of field focused on the man in the foreground. The camera then smoothly cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a bird's-eye view that looks directly down on the man.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, a Black man with dark, braided hair is shown. He wears a light-colored, horizontally striped t-shirt with the words \"AMERICA RECYCLES\" and a graphic printed on the chest. Over this, he has an unzipped dark jacket with a lighter, patterned lining visible on the left side. His accessories include a beaded choker-style necklace, another chain, earrings in both ears, rings on both hands—with a ring on the right ring finger and rings on the left ring and pinky fingers—and a gold-colored bracelet on his left wrist. He has a grill on his teeth. He brings a lit cigarette or cigarillo to his mouth to smoke, then leans back with his upper body tilted, arms spread out, exhaling a plume of smoke with his mouth open.",

    "Scene": "In a dark outdoor setting at night, a person is illuminated by a single, warm light source that casts a yellow-orange glow. The ground appears to be dirt, and the surrounding area is obscured by deep shadows, with the lower bodies of some people visible in the background. The individual, wearing a striped t-shirt with the words \"AMERICA RECYCLES\" and an open, dark jacket with a patterned lining, brings a small, lit object to their mouth. They then lean back, looking upwards as they exhale a plume of white smoke into the dimly lit air.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the foreground of the frame, with the camera at his level. Other figures are partially visible in the dark background. The man then leans backward, and the camera moves in an arc, transitioning from a level angle to a bird's-eye view. This transition reframes the scene into a medium close-up, with the man's head and torso now occupying the center of the frame as the camera shifts to a position above him."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
