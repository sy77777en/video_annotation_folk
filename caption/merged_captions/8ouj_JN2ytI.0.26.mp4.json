  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a narrow urban street is framed between two multi-story industrial buildings on the left and right. A silver sedan is stationary in the bottom center-left middle ground. The primary action begins amidst burning fire and thick smoke in the background, where an initial large, fiery explosion erupts on the left side of the street, sending flames and debris flying into the air. This is immediately followed by a series of smaller explosions that progress down the street from the background into the middle ground and across to the right side, engulfing a yellow taxi and a red car in the left-center middle ground, but not the overturned dark-colored SUV or truck on the right, positioned near large bales of compressed material, possibly cardboard or paper. Plumes of dark grey and black smoke and debris are propelled upwards and outwards from the middle ground, filling the upper portion of the frame. Additionally, a brown car is seen driving from the background to the middleground along the street, passing through the smoke. The paved road is extensively littered with scattered papers, pieces of metal, wood, and other fragments, including a fallen utility pole. The camera smoothly pans from left to right and tilts downward to effectively track the car's movement, maintaining steadiness throughout. Multi-story industrial-style buildings with numerous windows, some of which are broken, line both sides of the street; the building on the left features fire escapes, and the one on the right has loading docks. The video is shot from an overhead level at a high angle, looking down from above, featuring deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene sharply.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from an overhead level at a high angle, looking down from above. It features deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene sharply. The camera smoothly pans from left to right and tilts downward to effectively track the car's movement, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video's main focus is a series of large, bright orange and yellow explosions erupting in an urban street, sending plumes of dark grey and black smoke billowing upwards, accompanied by flying sparks and fiery debris. Several cars are present in the affected area: a silver sedan in the foreground appears relatively intact, while further up the street, a yellow taxi cab and a red car are surrounded by smoke and debris and appear damaged. On the right side of the street, a dark-colored SUV or truck is overturned or heavily damaged, positioned near large bales of compressed material, possibly cardboard or paper. The street is extensively littered with scattered papers, pieces of metal, wood, and other fragments. Multi-story industrial-style buildings with numerous windows, some of which are broken, line both sides of the street; the building on the left features fire escapes, and the one on the right has loading docks.",
    "Motion": "A large, fiery explosion erupts on the left side of an urban street, sending flames and debris flying into the air. Immediately after, a series of smaller explosions detonate further down the street, creating billowing clouds of dark grey and white smoke that rapidly expand and rise, scattering more debris across the scene. Additionally, a brown car is seen driving from the background to the middleground along the street, passing through the smoke.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, a chaotic scene unfolds during the daytime in a narrow urban street flanked by multi-story industrial buildings. A series of explosions erupts down the length of the street, creating large fireballs and plumes of black and grey smoke that billow into the air. The paved road is littered with debris, including scattered white papers, overturned vehicles, and a fallen utility pole. A silver sedan is parked in the foreground, while a wrecked yellow taxi and a red car are visible further down amidst the destruction. The light-colored buildings feature numerous windows and loading docks, with large, wrapped bales of material stacked along the side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
