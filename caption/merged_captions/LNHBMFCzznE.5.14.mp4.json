  "merged_caption": "A woman is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. She stands on a red carpet that occupies the bottom of the frame, wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern that falls to her knees, black knee-high boots, and a necklace. The scene is set indoors on a stage with a vibrant red carpet, and the backdrop is a large screen displaying an abstract, geometric pattern composed of various shades of blue. The stage is brightly lit, focusing attention on the central area where the woman is standing. The camera remains static and is positioned at the woman's level throughout the clip, using a deep focus to keep both the speaker and the background sharp. The shot is slightly unsteady and filmed from hip level with a level angle. The woman stands on the stage, actively speaking and frequently gesturing with her left hand. She shifts her weight from one leg to the other and occasionally steps to the side as she continues to address the audience. Throughout the video, she maintains an upright posture and uses her hand movements to emphasize points during her speech. She has an engaged expression on her face, and her gestures and movements are synchronized with her speech, adding emphasis to her points. The blue geometric backdrop fills the background, providing a contrasting visual element to the vibrant red carpet and the woman's attire.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
