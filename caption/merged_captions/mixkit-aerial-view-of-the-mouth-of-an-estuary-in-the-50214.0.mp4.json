  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from an aerial level with deep focus ensuring a large depth of field. Initially, a bay featuring turquoise water near its light-colored shore, which transitions to deep blue further out, is positioned in the center and middle ground. Arid, brown landmasses with sparse vegetation frame the bay from the bottom left and bottom right. Within the bay, a larger white yacht is located in the upper right portion, and a smaller sailboat is on the right-center of the frame. As the camera smoothly arcs clockwise, providing a panoramic view, another small yacht becomes visible in the upper right corner of the frame. The camera then tilts upwards, causing the foreground land to occupy less of the bottom frame, expanding the view to reveal more of the deep blue sea in the background and distant landforms appearing along the top edge of the frame. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, showcasing the contrast between the arid, rocky landmasses and the vibrant turquoise and deep blue waters of the bay, rather than on any specific object. The few boats present are small elements within the vastness of the scene, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the location. The drone slowly tilts upward, revealing more of the expansive bay and distant landforms under a clear, sunny sky.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial level, capturing the scene from a high angle. It employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise, providing a panoramic view of the bay and the boats. At the end of the video, the camera gradually tilts upward.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial coastal landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, showcasing the contrast between the arid, rocky landmasses and the vibrant turquoise and deep blue waters of the bay, rather than on any specific object. The few boats present are small elements within the vastness of the scene, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the location.",
    "Motion": "This is an aerial shot of a bay with turquoise water, surrounded by arid, rocky land. Initially, two boats are visible: a larger yacht and a smaller sailboat. As the camera moves, a third boat, another smaller yacht, comes into view, resulting in a scene with a larger yacht, a smaller sailboat, and an additional smaller yacht. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise and then tilts upward at the end, revealing more of the bay and the distant coastline.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a bay where turquoise water near a light-colored shore transitions to deep blue further out. Arid, brown, rocky land with sparse vegetation forms the coastline of the bay. Three white boats, including a larger yacht, a smaller sailboat, and another smaller yacht, are anchored in the water. The drone slowly tilts upward, revealing more of the expansive bay and distant landforms under a clear, sunny sky.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape. Initially, a bay featuring turquoise water near its light-colored shore, which transitions to deep blue further out, is positioned in the center and middle ground. Arid, brown landmasses are in the foreground, framing the bay from the bottom left and bottom right. Within the bay, a larger white yacht is located in the upper right portion, and a smaller sailboat is on the right-center of the frame. As the camera arcs clockwise, another small yacht becomes visible in the upper right corner of the frame. The camera then tilts upwards, causing the foreground land to occupy less of the bottom frame, expanding the view to reveal more of the deep blue sea in the background and distant landforms appearing along the top edge of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
