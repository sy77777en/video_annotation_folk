  "merged_caption": "The scene is framed on an orange surface, with a red hand occupying the left side, holding a short, cylindrical glass positioned in the left-center of the frame, resting on a skin-colored paper napkin marked with a gray spill. The glass contains a multi-colored liquid with a bright cyan top layer featuring swirling, magenta amoeba-like shapes, and a lower portion with a light green and pink camouflage pattern. An olive on a red toothpick is located in the top-right, resting in a small brown puddle. A small, cartoonish pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat emerges from behind the glass, walks to the right, and stops in the upper middle-right of the frame. A portion of a box is visible in the top-left corner. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The red hand holding the glass remains stationary throughout the video. As the video concludes, the pink elephant is positioned in the upper middle-right part of the frame.",

The glass contains a multi-colored liquid with a bright cyan top layer featuring swirling, magenta amoeba-like shapes, and a lower portion with a light green and pink camouflage pattern. To the right of the glass, a single green olive on a red toothpick lies in a small brown puddle on the orange surface.

    "Scene": "In a scene with a flat, animated style, a red hand holds a short glass on a vibrant orange surface. The glass contains a multi-colored liquid with a bright cyan top layer, featuring swirling, magenta amoeba-like shapes, and a lower portion with a light green and pink camouflage pattern. The glass sits on a skin-colored napkin marked with a gray spill. In the front right, a green olive on a red toothpick rests in a puddle of brown liquid. A small, cartoonish pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat appears from behind the cup and walks to the right, ending up in the upper middle-right part of the frame as the video concludes.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
