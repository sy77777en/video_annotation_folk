  "merged_caption": "An extreme close-up shot initially focuses on a hand with a light skin tone descending from above the frame in the center middle ground, picking up a flat, elongated metal piece with a brushed texture and four holes from the table over a drawing. The drawing on the table is a stylized, creature-like figure with a long, dark body, large, hollow eyes, and spindly limbs with hints of red on the feet, rendered in black charcoal with red accents. In the bottom left foreground, there are two erasers—one light blue and one white—visible on the paper. From a static, high-angle perspective, the camera captures the hand lifting the metal piece upward and out of the frame, moving it away from the charcoal drawing. As the hand lifts the metal piece, the focus transitions entirely to the drawing, which now occupies the center of the frame, revealing the figure's large, dark eyes and a wide, dark mouth. In the final composition, the drawing is in sharp focus in the middle ground, with other similar drawings visible in the blurred background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, maintaining an extremely shallow depth of field.",

    "Camera": "From a static, high-angle perspective, the camera focuses on the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field, capturing a hand picking up a metal piece.",
    "Subject": "A person's hand with a light skin tone picks up a flat, elongated metal piece with a brushed texture and four holes from the table. The drawing on the table is a stylized, creature-like figure with a long, dark body, large, hollow eyes, and spindly limbs with hints of red on the feet. On the left side of the frame, both a white and a light blue rectangular eraser are visible on the paper.",
    "Motion": "A hand lifts a flat metal piece upward, moving it away from a charcoal drawing of a creature on a piece of paper. The camera then shifts its focus to the drawing itself.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting, a hand picks up a small, flat metal piece with four holes from the table with the drawing. The drawing is a sketchy figure rendered in black charcoal with red accents. Two erasers, one light blue and one white, are visible on the paper. As the hand lifts the metal piece, the focus transitions entirely to the drawing, revealing the figure's large, dark eyes and a wide, dark mouth. Other similar drawings are visible in the blurred background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
