  "merged_caption": "The video opens on a wide shot of a winding asphalt road that begins in the bottom foreground and curves up into the middle ground of a hilly landscape under a dark, overcast sky. A person on a motorcycle appears as a small figure in the background, traveling down the road toward the camera. The motorcycle, with an orange fender and two orange lights beneath the handlebars, moves directly toward the camera, transitioning from the background to the foreground. As it gets closer, the shot transitions into a full shot, with the subject increasing in size. The motorcycle comes to a stop in the center foreground, with the rider facing forward. The rider, wearing a black helmet with a dark, reflective visor, a black leather jacket, black pants, and black boots with a portion of yellow socks visible above the boots, sits astride an orange and chrome motorcycle with a single, round, illuminated headlight. The rider puts both feet on the pavement to steady the bike and raises their right hand to just below the collar of their clothing. The winding road and hills, covered in muted green and brown grass, now occupy the background behind the subject. To the right of the damp, cracked road, a few small trees grow beside a stream. The camera is positioned at the subject's level in a static, eye-level shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape, from the road in the foreground to the hillside in the background, in sharp detail.",

    "Subject": "The video reveals a person on a motorcycle, initially seen as a small figure in the distance traveling down a winding road. As the motorcycle approaches and comes to a stop, the rider is shown wearing a black helmet with a dark, reflective visor, a black leather jacket, black pants, and black boots, with a portion of yellow socks visible above the boots. The rider sits astride an orange and chrome motorcycle, which has a single, round, illuminated headlight.",
    "Motion": "A motorcycle appears in the distance and travels down a winding road, moving directly toward the camera. As it gets closer, it slows down and comes to a complete stop in the center of the frame, with the rider putting both feet on the pavement to steady the bike. The rider then raises their right hand to just below the collar of their clothing.",
    "Scene": "At dusk, a narrow, winding asphalt road cuts through a rugged, hilly landscape under a dark, overcast sky. The hills are covered in muted green and brown grass. To the right of the damp, cracked road, a few small trees grow beside a stream. A person on a motorcycle with an orange fender and two orange lights beneath the handlebars drives up the road from the background and comes to a stop in the foreground, facing forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
