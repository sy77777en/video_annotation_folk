  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a residential neighborhood, capturing an expansive view of the environment. The camera starts with a narrow alleyway, where two buildings frame the scene on the left and right sides. The building on the left occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground, while the brown building is on the right. As the handheld camera, captured at eye level with a level angle, moves forward through the street scene, it exhibits noticeable shaking. The alley opens up, revealing more of the street and a traditional house in the middle ground, featuring a red-tiled roof and wooden upper structure, centered in the frame. A concrete wall runs along the front of the house, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame, adorned with colorful posters, which appear to be campaign posters with images and text, located near the center-right of the frame. Greenery, including a bush with small red flowers, is situated in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center, adding a natural touch to the urban environment. Power lines stretch across the top of the frame, connecting the buildings, with the blue sky forming the background. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at eye level relative to the surroundings, providing a steady and clear view of the scene throughout the video. Upon reaching an intersection, the camera briefly pauses before continuing forward with slight panning motions, focusing on the posters and the house, highlighting the details of the posters and the surrounding greenery. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible movement or activity, emphasizing the blend of urban and traditional elements in the quiet, sunlit alley of a residential area characterized by traditional Japanese architecture.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a narrow alleyway between two buildings, with a traditional house featuring a red-tiled roof and wooden structure in the middle ground. As the camera moves forward, the house becomes more prominent, and two posters on the wall in front of the house come into view. The camera continues to move closer, providing a clearer view of the posters, which appear to be campaign posters with images and text. After a brief pause, the camera resumes moving forward, focusing on the posters and the house, highlighting the details of the posters and the surrounding greenery.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a quiet, sunlit alley in a residential area, characterized by traditional Japanese architecture. Initially, the setting is outdoors with narrow pathways bordered by slightly taller buildings with textured walls, one white and the other brown. As the scene progresses, the road ahead opens up, becoming less confined. A prominent element is a house with a red-tiled roof and wooden upper structure, partially obscured by a concrete wall adorned with colorful posters. Lush green foliage, including a bush with small red flowers, adds a natural touch to the urban environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible movement or activity.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
