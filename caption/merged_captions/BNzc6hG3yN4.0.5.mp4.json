  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a full shot captures a teal sedan positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The car is surrounded by several men on a cracked, light-gray paved surface that fills the background. At the top of the frame, a concrete curb is visible. The camera performs a smooth, arcing crane-up motion over the group, starting at a high angle, transitioning to a bird's-eye view, and concluding at an upside-down high angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the movement. Three men are positioned on the car's hood on the right and top of the frame, with two facing the camera, both dressed in dark clothing. The man on the left wears a gold bracelet on his right hand and smokes a cigarette with his left hand. To the center-right, another man stands beside the open driver's door, moving his hands up and down near his head, while a fifth man is seated inside the car, though details about him are not clearly visible. In the center-left of the frame, two more men lean over the passenger side of the vehicle. The man on the right, whose clothing shows red on the inside, is outside the car giving a high-five to the smoking man. The ground is weathered, and the lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky. The entire scene is mostly static, with only minor movements from the subjects, as the camera captures the dynamics and spatial relationships from an overhead, second-floor height.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead, second-floor height, the camera performs a smooth, arcing crane-up motion over a group of people surrounding a car. The shot begins at a high angle, transitions to a bird's-eye view, and concludes at an upside-down high angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "From a high, top-down perspective, a teal sedan with a sunroof is surrounded by several men. Three men are sitting on the hood of the car, with two facing the camera, both dressed in dark clothing. The man on the left is wearing a gold bracelet on his right hand and is smoking a cigarette with his left hand. Another man, with his back to the camera, is wearing a dark blue hooded jacket. To the left of the smoking man, a man in dark clothing and red-and-white sneakers stands beside the open car door, holding his hands up to the sides of his head. To his left, another man is seated inside the car, though details about him are not clearly visible. On the opposite side of the car, two men are leaning over the vehicle. The man on the right, whose clothing shows red on the inside, is outside the car giving a high-five to the smoking man. Their attention is not directed towards the car’s interior.",
    "Motion": "From a high, top-down perspective, several men are positioned around and on a stationary teal car. A man sitting on the hood leans over to give a high-five to a man standing next to the car. Simultaneously, a man standing next to the open driver's side door moves his hands up and down near his head. The other individuals remain mostly still.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, an outdoor scene is captured on a cracked, light-gray paved surface during the daytime. A teal sedan with a sunroof is positioned diagonally in the shot, with its driver-side doors open. Several people wearing dark jackets are gathered around and on top of the car. The ground is weathered, and a concrete curb is visible along the top edge of the scene. The lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
