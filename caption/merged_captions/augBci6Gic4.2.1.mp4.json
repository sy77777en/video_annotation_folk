  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with a serious expression stands in the left foreground, wearing a black and white striped, long-sleeved shirt with a scoop neck and a black turban-style headwrap. A man with short blond hair and a light beard is seated in the right foreground, dressed in a red and white plaid button-up shirt over a grey t-shirt, with sleeves rolled up. The scene unfolds in a dark, minimalist setting against a solid black background, illuminated by several circular spotlights overhead. The light on the man and woman is a warm, yellow hue. The camera, at a smooth, low-angle, hip-level, arcs clockwise around the two actors on stage, maintaining deep focus. The woman gestures with her hands as she speaks, moving counterclockwise around the man, turning and walking past his left side to position herself behind him on his left side. As she continues to gesture emphatically, occasionally raising her fist, the man, with an expression of concern, seems to contemplate her words, occasionally glancing back at her. His response eventually makes her laugh. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video, capturing the dynamic interaction between the two.",

    "Camera": "A smooth, low-angle, hip-level camera arcs clockwise around the two actors on stage. A deep focus keeps both individuals clear and in view.",
    "Subject": "A woman with a serious expression stands over a seated man in a dimly lit space. She wears a black and white striped, long-sleeved shirt with a scoop neck and a black turban-style headwrap, gesturing with her hands while speaking. The man, who is sitting and looking up at her, has short blond hair and a light beard. He is dressed in a red and white plaid button-up shirt, worn open over a grey t-shirt, with the sleeves rolled up. His expression is one of concern as he listens to the woman. Then, she turns and walks past him on his left, moving to stand behind him on his left side. As she continues to talk, the man seems to be deep in thought, occasionally glancing back at her. His response eventually makes her laugh.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dark, minimalist setting against a solid black background. Illumination is provided by several circular spotlights positioned overhead, which cast distinct pools of cool, bluish-white light. However, the light illuminating the man and woman appears to be a warm, yellow hue. The space is otherwise unadorned, with the black void extending in all directions beyond the focused light.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a woman stands in the left foreground, while a man is seated in the right foreground. Several spotlights are visible in the top background against a black backdrop. The woman then turns and walks in front of the man, moving from the left side of the frame to the right middleground, where she stops behind his left shoulder. The man remains seated on the right, turning his head slightly to his left as she moves. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
