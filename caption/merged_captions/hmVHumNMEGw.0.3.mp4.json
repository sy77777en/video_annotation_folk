  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle, close-up shot from the subject's level, a white, chunky sneaker on a person's foot consistently occupies the lower-center-left foreground, with another white sneaker appearing behind it. The shoe features a thick, sculpted sole and a molded overlay covering the upper part, which has a ribbed, cage-like structure. The cuff of a pair of black pants is visible just above the sneaker. The concrete pavement fills the rest of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. A yellow painted sign is initially visible on the left side of the ground in the middle ground. The foot, clad in the white sneaker, takes a step forward and down onto the concrete surface, moving rightward. As the sneaker moves, the yellow sign in the middle ground exits the frame, with the sneaker remaining the dominant foreground element. The camera, featuring mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle, quickly tracks the person's foot, moving to the right while rolling first slightly clockwise, then rapidly counterclockwise. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The outdoor urban scene is characterized by a cool, teal-tinted color palette that affects the appearance of the pavement. In the background, a red brick building is visible, and there is a vignette overlay around the edges of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, ground-level shot features mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle. The slightly unsteady camera quickly tracks a person's foot, moving to the right while rolling first slightly clockwise, then rapidly counterclockwise. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A white, chunky sneaker is shown on a person's foot. The shoe features a thick, sculpted sole and a molded overlay covering the upper part, which has a ribbed, cage-like structure. The cuff of a pair of black pants is visible just above the sneaker.",
    "Motion": "In a high-angle, close-up shot, a person's foot, clad in a white sneaker, takes a step forward onto a concrete surface. The camera moves along with the foot, tracking the motion and keeping the shoe in focus.",
    "Scene": "In a high-angle, close-up shot, a person wearing black pants and a chunky, all-white sneaker steps on a concrete surface. The sneaker has a complex design with a thick, sculpted sole and a cage-like overlay on its upper. The outdoor urban scene is characterized by a cool, teal-tinted color palette that affects the appearance of the pavement. In the background, a yellow painted sign is slightly out of focus at first and soon goes out of view, with a red brick building visible. There is a vignette overlay around the edges of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
