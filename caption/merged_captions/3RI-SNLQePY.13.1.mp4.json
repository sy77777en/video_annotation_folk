  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a static, side-on perspective in a dark, digital environment rendered in pixel art with a blue-black color scheme. In the middle ground, two stylized, pixelated cranes with glowing white and blue hues and long, curved necks occupy the lower half of the frame, standing in shallow water amidst pixelated plants resembling lotuses on low platforms. One crane is positioned left of center and the other right of center, with the rightmost crane turning to face left as the video progresses. Above them, a small, round, beige character with eyes is initially located in the upper right on a platform of glowing blue, grid-patterned blocks that extends across the upper portion of the scene. This character moves from the upper right to the far left, jumping across gaps in the platform, overcoming obstacles, and successfully climbing a wall of blocks toward the top-left corner of the frame, eventually jumping through a gap in the ceiling. The scene is enhanced by a scanline effect and numerous short blue lines falling vertically, creating white dots of light upon contact with the ground, simulating rain. Four fish-shaped statues are present in the lower half of the background. Overlays include an icon in a box in the bottom-left corner and four pink heart shapes in the bottom-right. The cranes' bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings, and their long necks are gracefully curved as they stand on thin legs. The digital, retro aesthetic emphasizes the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the cranes.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases two stylized, pixelated cranes with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water within an underground or cave-like setting. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The cranes are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both initially facing to the right. As the video progresses, the rightmost crane turns to face left. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs. A light-colored blob with eyes appears at the top right of the screen, moving left and jumping several times to overcome obstacles, eventually climbing a wall towards a gap in the ceiling. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the cranes.",
    "Motion": "In a dark, pixelated environment, two glowing cranes stand in shallow water, with one crane slightly ahead of the other. The cranes begin to move to the right, with the rightmost crane turning to face left. A beige blob with eyes appears at the top right, moving left and jumping over obstacles. The blob successfully climbs a wall and jumps through a gap in the ceiling.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video captures a dark, digital environment rendered in pixel art, featuring a blue-black color scheme. The scene is enhanced by a scanline effect and numerous short blue lines falling vertically, creating white dots of light upon contact with the ground, simulating rain. The upper half showcases a pathway made of glowing blue, grid-patterned blocks. Below, a damp ground is home to two large, glowing, semi-transparent cranes standing amidst pixelated plants resembling lotuses on low platforms. Four fish-shaped statues are also present in the lower half of the background. A small, round, beige character moves along the upper platform. Overlays include an icon in a box in the bottom-left corner and four pink heart shapes in the bottom-right.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot is framed from a static, side-on perspective. In the middle ground, two large, glowing cranes with long, curved necks occupy the lower half of the frame, with one positioned left of center and the other right of center. Above them, a small, beige character is initially located in the upper right on a platform of blue blocks that extends across the upper portion of the scene. As the clip progresses, the beige character moves from the upper right to the far left, jumping across gaps in the platform. It then jumps vertically up a wall of blocks toward the top-left corner of the frame. During this action, the crane on the right turns its head to face left, while the crane on the left moves to the right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
