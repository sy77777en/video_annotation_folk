  "merged_caption": "In this medium close-up shot, a man with a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and glasses, wearing a white uniform with short sleeves and a matching white cap with a red stripe, is initially positioned slightly right of center in the foreground. His facial hair is neatly trimmed. The indoor setting has a warm, dimly lit ambiance, likely during the evening, with striped curtains occupying the background across the top half of the frame and a hanging light fixture in the top center middle ground. A green light source is visible in the left background, and a red neon light element is seen in the right middle ground. The man faces towards the left of the frame, moving towards the center-left while staying in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level but uses a low angle, looking up at the subject. The footage is noticeably shaky, with the camera panning to follow the man's movements, creating motion blur. The man begins to move his arm and flex his bicep, appearing to dance very relaxedly, with the camera capturing his rhythmic body movements. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting his profile and the details of his attire, enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood of the space. The background includes a window with curtains and some red lights, possibly from electronic devices. The camera remains level with the subject, maintaining a deep focus, but the blurring from the strong camera and subject motion makes it difficult to determine clearly. The walls and decor suggest a retro or vintage style, with muted colors and a cozy atmosphere, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
