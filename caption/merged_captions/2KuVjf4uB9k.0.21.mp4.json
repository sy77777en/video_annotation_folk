  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a red sports car with a prominent number \"42\" on its side, drifting on a winding, dusty road in a desert-like environment. Initially, the car occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The camera, placed above the car at a high angle, captures most of its body as it navigates the curve, though approximately half of the car is obscured during the transition from behind to in front. The car emits thick white smoke from its tires, showcasing its agility and power. The road, visible in the foreground and background, frames the car dynamically, bordered by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. As the car continues its turn, the camera maintains its overhead position, smoothly transitioning from behind to in front of the car. This shift reveals a gray car following behind, which appears in the background only after the camera moves to the front of the red car, adding an element of competition. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, executing a complex maneuver by smoothly arcing clockwise around the car, initially positioned behind the car and moving to the front by the end, tracking the car from an aerial view with minimal shaking. The setting is outdoors, with a clear sky indicating daytime, and the road curves through a rugged landscape. The red sports car, notable for its sleek design, visible engine, and large rear spoiler, maneuvers through the curves, highlighting its glossy red paint and aerodynamic shape. The scene captures the interplay between the vehicle's vibrant color and the natural, muted backdrop, emphasizing the sharp turns and elevation changes of the road.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down at a racing car. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone executes a complex maneuver, smoothly arcing clockwise around the car, initially positioned behind the car and moving to the front by the end, tracking the car from an aerial view with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a red sports car with a prominent number \"42\" on its side, drifting on a winding, dusty road. The car has a sleek design with a visible engine and a large rear spoiler. It emits thick white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed movement and sharp turns. The car's glossy red paint and aerodynamic shape are highlighted as it maneuvers through the curves, showcasing its agility and power. The setting is flat terrain, enhancing the focus on the car's performance. As the camera transitions from the back to the front of the red car, a gray car can be seen driving behind it, adding an element of competition to the scene.",
    "Motion": "A red sports car with the number '411' on both sides is drifting on a winding, dusty road in a desert-like environment. The car emits thick white smoke from its tires as it maneuvers through the curves, showcasing its agility and power. The camera transitions from the back to the front of the red car, revealing a gray car driving behind it, indicating a sense of competition.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an overhead perspective, presents a view of a winding mountain road. The setting is outdoors, with a clear sky indicating daytime. The road curves through a rugged landscape, bordered by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. A red sports car, notable for its sleek design and visible engine, drifts along the road, creating plumes of smoke that contrast with the earthy tones of the surroundings. As the camera moves forward and pans right, it transitions to a position in front of the red sports car, revealing a gray race car in pursuit behind it. The car's movement is dynamic, emphasizing the sharp turns and elevation changes of the road. The scene captures the interplay between the vehicle's vibrant color and the natural, muted backdrop.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of a red sports car drifting on a winding road. Initially, the car occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The camera, placed above the car, captures most of its body as it navigates the curve, though approximately half of the car is obscured during the transition from behind to in front. The car's 2D position shifts slightly from the center-left towards the center-right as it drifts. The road, visible in the foreground and background, frames the car dynamically. Sparse vegetation and rocky terrain border the road, situated in the background. As the car continues its turn, the camera maintains its overhead position, smoothly transitioning from behind to in front of the car. This shift reveals a gray car following behind, which appears in the background only after the camera moves to the front of the red car. The camera's consistent height above the cars ensures a clear view of their movements and the surrounding landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
