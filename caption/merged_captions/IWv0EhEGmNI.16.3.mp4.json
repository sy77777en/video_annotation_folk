  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot of a dark-colored, military-style helicopter, featuring a prominent front windshield, positioned in the middle ground and occupying the right-center of the frame. A large circular pipeline is visible on the left side of the background, unrelated to the helicopter. Initially, the pilot's head is visible inside the helicopter, and as the helicopter descends, a spotlight on the top of the frame activates, casting a beam of light forward and illuminating the immediate area, revealing some atmospheric haze. The camera is at ground level, initially at a low angle looking up at the helicopter, then moves down and pans from left to right, transitioning to a level angle as it moves from right to left, all while maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. The helicopter lands in a dense, shadowy forest at night, settling in the center of the frame. Small green and red lights glow from within the cockpit. Once the helicopter has landed, a person in dark attire, possibly tactical gear, disembarks from its right side, moving toward the left side of the frame. A bright spotlight, mounted on the left side of the frame near the cockpit, illuminates the scene. An overlay of the text \"Kyle: Yes, sir.\" appears at the bottom of the screen.",

    "Subject": "A dark-colored, military-style helicopter, featuring a prominent front windshield, is shown landing in a dimly lit setting. A large circular pipeline is visible in the background on the left side of the frame. A bright spotlight, mounted on the left side of the frame near the cockpit, illuminates the scene. Inside the cockpit, a helmeted pilot is partially visible. As the helicopter settles, a person in dark attire, possibly tactical gear, disembarks from its side.",
    "Motion": "A spotlight on the side of the stationary helicopter turns on, casting a beam of light forward as it lands. The side door then opens, and a person exits the aircraft, stepping onto the ground.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an objective viewpoint, shows a dark-colored helicopter in a dense, shadowy forest at night. Initially, the helicopter is dimly visible against the dark trees and uneven ground. A large, circular structure is noticeable in the background on the left side of the frame, unrelated to the helicopter. A bright spotlight on the helicopter then activates, casting a strong beam of light forward, illuminating the immediate area and revealing some atmospheric haze, while small green and red lights glow from within the cockpit. An overlay of the text \"Kyle: Yes, sir.\" appears at the bottom of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a low-angle shot of a helicopter, which is positioned in the middle ground and occupies the right-center of the frame. A large circular duct is visible on the left side of the background, unrelated to the helicopter. Initially, the pilot's head is visible inside the helicopter, and as the helicopter descends, a spotlight on the top of the frame activates. The camera tracks its movement, shifting from a low angle to a level perspective. Once the helicopter has landed in the center of the frame, a person disembarks from its right side, moving toward the left side of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
