  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads, focusing on their upper bodies and heads. The camera is static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus to maintain a large depth of field throughout. Among the group of four individuals, the two on the right are positioned in the foreground, while the person on the left and the one in the middle wearing a tall red top hat are in the middle ground. The person working independently in the top right corner is in the background. A small black rectangular screen is placed on a white platform in the center, positioned in the middle ground. The setting is an indoor environment with a minimalist, monochromatic design, characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space, devoid of additional furniture or props. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the simplicity and uniformity of the scene. The video shows the four individuals forming a group focused on a white, human-like figure on a white flat. One of these four, wearing a red top hat, is prominently positioned in the center, leaning toward the screen. As the person on the left moves the figure toward the center, the other three lean in to observe closely. Meanwhile, the fifth individual, positioned at the back right, appears to be working independently, possibly conducting an experiment. Once the figure is placed in the center, the group of four continues to focus on it, while the lone individual remains engaged in their own task. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One stands out by wearing a tall red top hat.

    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen placed on a white platform. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise uniform scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, intently watching a human-like white figure being held by the person on the left. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the group. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the simplicity and uniformity of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
