  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a large green figure crouching in the center foreground on a grassy area, with a large stone building positioned in the background. The figure, a muscular humanoid with green skin and dark hair, is shirtless, showcasing a highly defined physique, and is wearing dark pants. The setting suggests an outdoor environment on a grassy area surrounded by stone buildings, with mostly cloudy skies and a few patches of blue visible. As the figure begins to rise, it clenches its fist, shifting its weight and starting to lift its body. The camera, initially at ground level, transitions to eye level, starting with a level angle and shifting to a low angle as it tilts upward to follow the figure's movement. This causes the shot to change into a medium close-up that frames the subject from the chest up in the center of the frame. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, and its movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the figure continues to stand up, its arms and legs move in a coordinated manner, demonstrating its strength and muscular definition. The figure fully stands up, revealing its entire upper body and the details of its attire. The background remains consistent throughout, showcasing the stone building with its gothic architectural style and a cloudy sky. The imposing presence of the figure, with its rough and detailed texture, emphasizes its strength and disrupts the otherwise calm atmosphere, creating a dynamic visual contrast. Throughout this action, the camera remains positioned at the subject's level, with the figure remaining in the foreground.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a large, muscular humanoid figure on all fours, positioned on a grassy area in front of a stone building with arched windows and a structure resembling a clock tower. As the figure starts to rise, it clenches its fist, shifting its weight and beginning to lift its body. Its attire, including dark pants, is visible even before it fully stands. As it continues to stand up, its arms and legs move in a coordinated manner, demonstrating its strength and muscular definition. The figure fully stands up, revealing its entire upper body and the details of its attire. The background remains consistent throughout, showcasing the stone building with its gothic architectural style and a cloudy sky.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting on a grassy area surrounded by stone buildings, suggesting a campus or historical site. The time of day appears to be daytime, with mostly cloudy skies and only a few patches of blue visible. The environment is characterized by well-maintained grass and the presence of large, imposing stone structures with architectural arches, adding a sense of grandeur. The scene includes a large, muscular figure with green skin, positioned prominently in the foreground, displaying a powerful stance. The figure's rough and detailed texture emphasizes its strength and disrupts the otherwise calm atmosphere, creating a dynamic visual contrast.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a full shot of a large green figure crouching in the center foreground on a grassy area, with a large stone building positioned in the background. As the figure rises to a standing position, the camera tilts upward to follow this movement, causing the shot to change into a medium close-up that frames the subject from the chest up in the center of the frame. Throughout this action, the camera remains positioned at the subject's level, with the figure remaining in the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
