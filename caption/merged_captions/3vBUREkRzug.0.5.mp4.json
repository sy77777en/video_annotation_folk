  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, captured at the subject's level, features a light blue hydrofoil catamaran positioned in the middle ground, initially slightly right of the center of the frame, moving towards the left. The catamaran, with \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" on its hull, sails swiftly across a choppy, dark blue-green body of water, elevated on its hydrofoils and creating a significant white wake. The sail closest to the viewer also features the \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" logo, while the sail further away displays the \"ORACLE\" logo. The hull features red and white stripes, and at the front, a triangular sail with a gold \"ROLEX\" logo set against a black parallelogram background. The choppy water occupies the foreground and extends into the lower middle ground. In the background, a hazy, greyish city skyline with numerous buildings spans the upper left to the upper center of the frame, while the upper right features a section of shoreline greenery under an overcast sky. The camera is positioned at a level angle, at water-level, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It trucks left while simultaneously moving forward, tracking the sailboat from the side as the boat becomes larger in the frame. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the video progresses, the catamaran continues its movement towards the left side of the frame, maintaining its middle ground position. The San Francisco city skyline is visible in the distance, with mist and clouds partially obscuring the tops of some tall buildings, and glimpses of distant shoreline greenery are seen. The overcast sky is visible at the very top, completing the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a light blue hydrofoil catamaran sailing swiftly across a choppy, dark blue-green body of water. The catamaran is equipped with two large sails that are primarily blue and white, accented with red stripes. The sail in the distance features the \"ORACLE\" logo, while the closer sail displays the \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" logo. Its hull features red and white stripes, and at the front of the hull, there is a triangular sail that is primarily blue with red stripes and some white accents. This sail features a gold \"ROLEX\" logo and text set against a black parallelogram background. The boat is elevated above the water on its hydrofoils, creating a significant white wake as it moves.

    "Scene": "The video captures a light blue hydrofoil catamaran moving swiftly across choppy, dark blue-green water during the daytime, with the San Francisco city skyline visible in the distance under an overcast sky. Mist and clouds partially obscure the tops of some tall buildings. The catamaran's hull is adorned with \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" in large lettering and red and white accents, while its light blue sails feature red designs and sponsor logos like \"ORACLE\" and \"ROLEX.\" A prominent white wake trails behind the vessel as it glides over the water, with glimpses of distant shoreline greenery.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
