  "merged_caption": "This high-angle full shot initially frames a damaged white and black Ford stock car, featuring a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof, in the center-right middle ground, positioned on a paved track apron next to a grass infield. The car's front end is visibly damaged and crumpled, with a wisp of steam rising from the hood. A white Ford F-150 pickup truck, identified as an \"AMR SAFETY TEAM\" vehicle with flashing lights on its roof, is located in the top-left middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a portion of a silver catch fence is visible. From a high, aerial angle, the camera slowly and smoothly zooms out, transitioning the scene into a wide shot and revealing more of the surrounding racetrack. Throughout the clip, three safety team members in blue and white uniforms and white helmets exit the truck, one after another, and walk to the driver's side of the race car. They gather around the driver's side window, with one person leaning in toward the car to attend to the situation. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp and clear, capturing the nighttime racetrack environment as the safety crew members work.",

    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at a racetrack at night. A damaged white and black number 98 Ford stock car is stationary, positioned partially on the paved track apron and partially on the adjacent green grass infield. The car's front end is crumpled, and a wisp of steam rises from the hood. Next to the race car, a white safety truck is parked on the pavement with its headlights and roof lights on. In the foreground, a portion of a silver catch fence is visible. Several safety crew members in blue uniforms and white helmets exit the truck and approach the driver's side of the damaged vehicle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
