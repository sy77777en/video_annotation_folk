  "merged_caption": "This full, high-angle shot initially frames a small motorboat with a blue hull and a white cabin in the top left middle ground, moving from left to right across dark, murky water, leaving a narrow wake. A large, spiky creature, partially visible beneath the surface, creates a much larger disturbance as it moves from right to left, churning the water into a wide, foamy mass that passes the boat on its right side. This disturbance occupies the center and right of the frame, also in the middle ground, with a structure visible in the foreground along the bottom edge, suggesting the scene is observed from a bridge or a large vessel. As the video progresses, the motorboat moves towards the top right, while the creature travels from the right towards the left, expanding across the water's surface. The camera, from a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, pans left to track the large, unseen subject moving through the water, maintaining a deep focus to clearly capture the significant wake created by the subject as well as the small boat nearby. Sunlight glints off the surface of the otherwise murky water, adding a reflective quality to some areas. The camera movement ensures the creature remains the primary focus, emphasizing the contrast between the small boat's narrow wake and the wide, churning mass of white, foamy water created by the creature, which dwarfs the wake of the smaller vessel.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, the camera pans left to track a large, unseen subject moving through the water. The shot maintains a deep focus, clearly capturing the significant wake created by the subject as well as a small boat nearby.",
    "Subject": "From a high-angle perspective, a small motorboat with a blue hull and a white cabin moves across a body of dark water, leaving a narrow wake. A significantly larger disturbance, resembling the movement of a large, spiky creature beneath the surface, creates a wide, churning mass of white, foamy water that dwarfs the wake of the smaller vessel. The water appears dark and murky, with some areas reflecting light.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle view, a small motorboat moves from left to right across the dark water, leaving a narrow wake. A large, spiky creature, partially visible beneath the surface, creates a much larger disturbance as it moves from right to left, churning the water into a wide, foamy mass that passes the boat on its right side.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, a small blue and white motorboat moves across a body of dark water, leaving a trail in its wake. The main focus is a much larger, powerful disturbance in the water, a wide expanse of white, churning foam and turbulent waves. Sunlight glints off the surface of the otherwise murky water. The edges of a concrete structure are visible at the top and bottom of the view, suggesting the scene is observed from a bridge or a large vessel.",
    "Spatial": "This full, high-angle shot initially frames a small motorboat in the top left middle ground, moving across dark water. A large, spiky creature causes a churning water disturbance that occupies the center and right of the frame, also in the middle ground, with a structure visible in the foreground along the bottom edge. As the video progresses, the motorboat moves towards the top right, while the creature travels from the right towards the left, expanding across the water's surface. The camera pans to the left, following the movement and keeping the creature as the primary focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
