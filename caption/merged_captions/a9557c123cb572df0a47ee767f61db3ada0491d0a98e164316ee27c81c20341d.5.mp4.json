  "merged_caption": "The scene features a tunnel composed of concentric rings, with a small white circle visible at the end of the tunnel. Silver pentagons are embedded on the rings around. As the video progresses, the camera gets closer to the tunnel, causing the white circle to expand until it fills a big part of the frame. The perspective shifts through a tunnel of rotating, concentric rings. As the scene progresses, the rings expand outward, and the central white circle enlarges, predominantly occupying the center of the frame. The concentric rings expand outwards, moving past and out of view, leaving the innermost ring to frame the enlarged white circle by the end of the shot. A view of a tunnel-like structure reveals a series of nested concentric rings. The rings with a dark, metallic material and a textured diamond plate pattern, studded with small silver-colored metallic pentagons, are not the outermost ones. Closer to the center, the rings are smooth, black, and glossy. At the center of the composition is a bright, solid white circle that contrasts with the surrounding dark structure. The scene depicts an installation of a dark, abstract tunnel composed of multiple rotating, concentric rings. The outermost rings feature a dark grey, textured diamond plate pattern, while the inner rings are smoother and black with a slight sheen. Small, silver, pentagonal objects are embedded at intervals along some of the rings. At the center of the tunnel is a bright, white, circular void that gradually expands, framed by the innermost black ring, creating a dynamic visual experience as the viewer's perspective shifts toward the light. The video appears to be computer-generated, and the camera's framing and movement are unclear.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
