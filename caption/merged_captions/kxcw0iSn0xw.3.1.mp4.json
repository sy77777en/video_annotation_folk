  "merged_caption": "The video is captured in a close-up shot from a level angle, focusing on a pair of hands and a twisted light blue balloon submerged within a water tank that fills the frame. The hands, with visible arm hair and light skin tone, and lower arms enter from the top of the frame, with the left hand positioned on the right and the right hand on the left, both in the foreground. They hold a flexible, light-blue balloon that occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, set against a plain white background. The right hand holds a pin, moving it from the left side to puncture the balloon. Following the puncture, the balloon's skin rapidly shrinks from left to right across the center of the frame. The water that was inside the balloon momentarily holds its shape in the center before dispersing, sending a large splash and bubbles moving upwards and outwards through the middle ground. The hands remain relatively stationary in their positions on the left and right sides of the frame during this event. The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between slow and regular playback speeds. The camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The water is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the hands and the object, and the lighting is bright, highlighting the smooth texture and glossy surface of the blue object. The scene conveys a sense of clarity and focus on the interaction between the hands and the object within the water.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between slow and regular playback speeds. The camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a pair of hands and the lower half of the arms, which have visible arm hair, interacting with a twisted long light blue balloon submerged in a water tank. The hands, with light skin tone, are positioned to press the air-filled balloon into the water. The right hand holds a pin, used to puncture the balloon, causing its outer skin to shrink rapidly. Despite the puncture, the air inside initially retains the balloon's shape before dispersing, and the burst creates a large bubble. The hands are engaged in a precise action, demonstrating controlled and deliberate movement.",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands is seen interacting with a twisted light blue balloon submerged in a water tank. The person uses a pin held in their right hand to puncture the balloon, causing it to burst. The balloon contains air, and as the air escapes, it causes the water in the tank to move. The hands remain steady even after the balloon has burst, and the balloon's outer skin shrinks significantly.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an underwater scene in a clear tank filled with water, focusing on a pair of hands interacting with a flexible, light blue object that resembles a tube. The water is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the hands and the object. The background is a plain white surface, enhancing the visibility of the elements within the tank. Bubbles are present, indicating movement and interaction with the water. The lighting is bright, highlighting the smooth texture and glossy surface of the blue object. The scene conveys a sense of clarity and focus on the interaction between the hands and the object within the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
