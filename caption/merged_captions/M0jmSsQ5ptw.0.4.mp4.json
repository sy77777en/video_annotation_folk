  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring a man with a light skin tone, wearing a blue short-sleeved polo shirt, white pants, and a white hat, standing on a raised platform in the center-right foreground, next to a large grey and orange golf bag. He holds a golf club and wears a white glove on his left hand. A black ramp is positioned in the left middle ground, with a large blue and black inflatable structure further to the left. Mountains are visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky. As the camera, filmed from a smooth, eye-level perspective with a level angle, begins on the man playing golf, it gradually dollies backward while panning left to reveal the full scene. A wooden structure with a small tricycle on it becomes visible in the left middle ground. A second man with a light skin tone, dressed in a yellow short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, walks into the frame from the left, approaches the wooden seesaw, picks up a skateboard from one end, and walks back toward the right edge of the frame. As the camera moves, the man on the platform is repositioned to the right middle ground, where he takes a practice swing with the golf club and then positions himself to hit a golf ball. The camera maintains a deep focus throughout. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the top of the raised, black-draped platform.",

    "Subject": "A man with a light skin tone, wearing a blue short-sleeved polo shirt, white pants, and a white hat, stands on a raised platform covered in artificial grass. He holds a golf club and wears a white glove on his left hand, positioned next to a large grey and orange golf bag. To the left, another man with a light skin tone, dressed in a yellow short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, walks over to a skateboard, picks it up, and then turns to walk away.",
    "Motion": "A man in a blue shirt takes a practice swing with a golf club on a raised platform and then positions himself to hit a golf ball. In the background, another man in a yellow shirt walks toward a wooden seesaw, picks up a skateboard from one end, and then turns and walks away.",
    "Scene": "On a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, with mountains visible in the distance, a scene is set up for an activity. In the foreground, a raised, black-draped platform is topped with artificial green turf. Next to it stands a black ramp. In the middle ground, there is a large, blue and black inflatable structure and a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on one end. A person in golf attire stands on the platform next to a golf bag. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the top of the raised, black-draped platform.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring a man in a blue shirt standing on a raised platform in the center-right foreground, next to a golf bag. A black ramp is positioned in the left middle ground, with a large blue inflatable structure further to the left. Mountains are visible in the background. As the camera zooms out to a wide shot, a wooden structure with a small bicycle on it becomes visible in the left middle ground. A second man in a yellow shirt walks into the frame from the left, approaches the wooden structure, picks up a skateboard, and walks back toward the right edge of the frame. As the camera moves, the man on the platform is repositioned to the right middle ground, preparing his golf swing. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
