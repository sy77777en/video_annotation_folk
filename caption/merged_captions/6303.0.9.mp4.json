  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a Black man with a large, curly afro, a mustache, and a goatee, positioned in the center foreground, holding a white laundry basket filled with light-colored clothing at the bottom of the frame. He wears a bright orange, textured, long-sleeved sweater and a silver chain necklace with a circular pendant. In the background, a row of white and light-blue washing machines spans the width of the scene, with bottles of laundry detergent placed on top. A large, rectangular landscape painting depicting green trees hangs on the center wall directly behind the man, and a green light is positioned behind his head. The scene takes place in a laundromat with deep blue walls, illuminated by a cool, greenish-blue ambient light. The camera is positioned at eye level and moves smoothly forward toward the man in the foreground, using a speed ramp effect that shifts between fast and slow playback speeds. Midway through, the camera tilts slightly upward, changing to a low-angle shot, while a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up, tightening the frame on the man who remains centered. Throughout the video, the man remains still, holding the laundry basket, as his expression changes from relaxed to surprised when the camera moves closer to him.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
