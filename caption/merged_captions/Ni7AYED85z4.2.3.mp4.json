  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing a man with light skin, gray hair, and a short gray beard, wearing a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans, standing near the bottom right of the frame in the middle ground, facing toward the center left where a street musician with light skin and dark hair is seated. The musician, playing an acoustic guitar with a hat for tips on the ground, is positioned left of center in the frame and is the primary focus of the video. Several other people are scattered throughout the plaza, mostly in the background and middle ground, with some groups standing or walking across the open space, distributed from left to right. The camera is at the same height as the man, providing a level perspective. The buildings and café tables with umbrellas form the background, stretching across the top and sides of the frame, while the sky fills the uppermost portion. The man stands still with his hands in his pockets, facing the musician and remaining stationary throughout the video. The street musician sits and strums the guitar without changing position. Other people in the scene either walk past in different directions or stand in small groups, occasionally pausing to watch the musician before continuing on their way. The video is recorded at eye level with a level camera angle, featuring mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The camera smoothly pans left while tilting downward, ending with a slight clockwise roll that introduces a varying Dutch angle. Towards the end of the video, a camera slightly emerges from the bottom foreground of the frame. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positions during the video; the framing remains stable, maintaining the spatial relationships between the man, musician, and surrounding elements.",

    "Camera": "The video is recorded at eye level with a level camera angle, featuring mild barrel distortion that causes straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The camera smoothly pans left while tilting downward, ending with a slight clockwise roll that introduces a varying Dutch angle. Camera movement is steady with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin, gray hair, and a short gray beard, who appears to be middle-aged and is wearing a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans; he stands with his hands in his pockets, facing toward a street musician. The musician, who is also a man with light skin and dark hair, is seated and playing an acoustic guitar; he wears a dark jacket and pants, and has a hat placed on the ground in front of him for tips. Several other people are present in the scene, including small groups and individuals walking or standing nearby, most dressed in casual clothing such as jackets and jeans. The main subject’s attention is directed toward the musician, while the other people appear to be either passing by or observing from a distance, establishing the musician as the focal point of the main subject’s interest.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor plaza bordered by tall, reddish-brown and beige buildings with green shutters and arched windows, some featuring ornate stonework. The ground is paved with large, light gray stone tiles. Several groups of people are scattered throughout the open space, some standing and others walking, while a street musician sits on a low stool playing a guitar near an open instrument case and a hat placed on the ground. To one side, a man in a dark jacket and jeans stands with his hands in his pockets, facing the musician. Outdoor café tables with umbrellas line the edge of the plaza, and the sky above is partly cloudy. Towards the end of the video, a camera slightly emerges from the bottom of the frame, indicating the perspective of someone actively recording or observing the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
