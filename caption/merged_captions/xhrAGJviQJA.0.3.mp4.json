  "merged_caption": "In a locked-on point of view, a black quadcopter drone with a mounted camera is centered in the foreground, captured from a frontal perspective. The drone, featuring a central body with four arms extending outwards, each tipped with a black propeller assembly, has a metallic sheen. Mounted on top of the drone's central frame is a black, box-shaped action camera with a large, circular lens on its front face, and below it, the word \"GoPro\" is written in blue text, secured by a black mounting bracket. The rocky mountain landscape occupies half of the frame, stretching from the middle ground directly beneath the drone into the background, while the other half of the frame is filled with a blue sky and scattered clouds, situated above the drone and the mountain peaks. The drone hovers in mid-air, and the camera leads the drone from the front, moving backward with a deep focus that keeps both the drone and the mountainous landscape sharp. The shot begins at a level angle, with the drone gliding smoothly through the air against the backdrop of a vast, rocky mountain landscape under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The terrain below is a mix of grey rock, sparse vegetation, and patches of white snow, suggesting a high-altitude, alpine environment during the daytime. The drone then executes a sudden clockwise roll, ending in an upside-down position, creating a varying Dutch angle. As the viewpoint moves forward, the rocky, mountainous landscape in the background scrolls past, with the camera rotating upside-down, maintaining the drone's position in the foreground while the environment shifts around it.",

    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot captures a black drone gliding smoothly through the air, with a boxy, black GoPro camera mounted on its top frame. The drone moves against the backdrop of a vast, rocky mountain landscape under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The terrain below is a mix of grey rock, sparse vegetation, and patches of white snow, suggesting a high-altitude, alpine environment during the daytime.",
    "Spatial": "In a locked-on point of view, a drone with a mounted camera is centered in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the drone's level, capturing it from a frontal perspective. The rocky mountain landscape occupies half of the frame, stretching from the middle ground directly beneath the drone into the background. The other half of the frame is filled with a blue sky and scattered clouds, situated above the drone and the mountain peaks before the camera rotates upside-down."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
