  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a small, stout rodent with light brown and grey fur, small rounded ears, dark eyes, and long, thin whiskers, centered in the foreground. The rodent is perched on the slope of a large, lichen-covered rock that fills the bottom foreground, with patches of light green and yellow lichen. In the background, a blurred green meadow is visible below a bright, hazy white sky, suggesting an overcast or foggy day. The camera maintains a level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the small rodent on the rock in sharp focus while blurring the green background. The camera performs a smooth, slight tilt down and then back up, with a minor wobble, capturing the rodent as it remains stationary throughout the video. The rodent keeps its body still while its belly and nose make very slight movements and its whiskers twitch. The camera slightly tilts downward at the subject's level throughout the shot, enhancing the focus on the rodent's alert posture as it looks towards its right.",

    "Subject": "A small, stout rodent with light brown and grey fur is perched on the slope of a large, lichen-covered rock. The animal has small, rounded ears, dark eyes, and long, thin whiskers. It is positioned on the slope of the grey rock, which has patches of light green and yellow lichen, and it is looking alertly towards its right.",
    "Motion": "A small rodent is perched on a rock, remaining stationary throughout the video. It keeps its body still while its belly and nose make very slight movements and its whiskers twitch.",
    "Scene": "In a natural, open landscape, a small, brown, furry animal rests atop a large, coarse-textured boulder. The rock's surface is speckled with light green and grey lichen. Behind the boulder, a vibrant green meadow blurs into a soft-focus background under a bright, hazy white sky, suggesting an overcast or foggy day.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a small rodent centered in the foreground. The rodent is perched on a large rock that fills the bottom foreground. In the background, a blurred green meadow is visible below a hazy white sky. The camera slightly tilts downward at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
