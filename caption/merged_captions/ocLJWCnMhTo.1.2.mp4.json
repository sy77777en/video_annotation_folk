  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a light-skinned, balding man, who appears to be middle-aged or older, is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, suspended mid-air in a tucked position with his knees drawn up toward his torso and his arms hooked around his lower legs. He is barefoot and wears light blue striped pajamas. A glowing, fiery, orange-yellow visual effect surrounds his entire body in a roughly spherical form, appearing to spark and move around him. Behind the man, a dark horizontal bar stretches across the scene in the middle ground. The indoor setting features light-colored walls and flooring, with a grainy, vintage quality and a muted, purplish color cast. Black bar overlays are present on both sides of the video, and the four corners of the frame feature a vignette effect, adding a dark overlay. As the video plays, the camera, from an unsteady, eye-level perspective, slowly circles clockwise around the man, moving from a frontal view to a side profile, revealing more of the surrounding space. The camera also pans to the right and appears to move slightly backward, causing his position to shift from the center to the left of the middle ground and revealing more of the room in the background. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp. While the man stays mostly still, the fiery, glowing visual effect continues to swirl and spark around his body, with swirling, golden, fiery light effects moving around his head and torso. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the dynamics of the scene as it evolves.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera circles clockwise around a man hovering in midair at the center of the frame, curled into a tucked pose. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned, balding man, who appears to be middle-aged or older, is depicted as suspended mid-air in a tucked position, with his knees drawn up toward his torso and his arms hooked around his lower legs. He is barefoot and wears light blue striped pajamas. A glowing, fiery, orange-yellow visual effect surrounds his entire body in a roughly spherical form, appearing to spark and move around him.",
    "Motion": "A man remains suspended in mid-air, holding a tucked position with his knees drawn to his chest. While he stays mostly still, a fiery, glowing visual effect swirls and sparks around his body. The camera slowly circles him, moving from a frontal view to a side profile, revealing more of the surrounding space.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with light-colored walls and flooring, a dark horizontal bar extends across the middle of the room. A person in light-colored clothing appears to be suspended in midair, adopting a tucked position with knees drawn up toward the torso and arms wrapped around the lower legs. The scene has a grainy, vintage quality with a muted, purplish color cast. A glowing orange-yellow visual effect envelops the entire body in a roughly spherical shape, while swirling, golden, fiery light effects move around the person's head and torso. Black bar overlays are present on both sides of the video, and the four corners of the frame feature a vignette effect, adding a dark overlay.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, suspended in a tucked position. A glowing visual effect surrounds him in the foreground. Behind the man, a dark horizontal bar stretches across the scene in the middle ground. As the video plays, the camera rotates clockwise around the man, causing his position to shift from the center to the left of the middle ground. The camera also pans to the right and appears to move slightly backward, revealing more of the room in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
