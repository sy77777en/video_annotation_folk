  "merged_caption": "This first-person point-of-view shot begins with a bird's eye view, looking down from a mountain peak. In the foreground, the arms and upper legs of a light-skinned person occupy the bottom of the frame, with their hands positioned in the bottom-center as they adjust a bright, fluorescent yellow and dark blue garment. The middle ground is composed of a steep, rocky slope that fills the center of the frame, with the person's shadow cast onto this slope, forming a clear, dark silhouette of a standing human figure centrally and just ahead of their body. In the background, a deep valley with green areas and winding paths is visible in the top portion of the frame, situated far below the camera's position. Initially motionless but unsteady, the camera features mild barrel distortion and begins with a slightly unsteady, motionless bird's-eye view looking straight down at the ground. The person's right hand pulls the zipper up on the left side of the yellow garment they are wearing, and then their left hand zips up the right side before moving away from their chest. The camera then rolls clockwise and slightly tilts upward as the person turns to the right, causing a transition from a bird's eye view to a high-angle perspective and creating a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire mountainous scene sharp. The scene is set during the daytime under a clear sky, with bright sunlight casting a distinct shadow of the person onto the rocks in front of them.",

    "Camera": "This first-person, eye-level video features mild barrel distortion. The shot begins with a slightly unsteady, motionless bird's-eye view looking straight down at the ground. The camera then rolls clockwise and slightly tilts upward as the person turns to the right, causing the perspective to shift to a high angle and creating a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire mountainous scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, the arms and hands of a light-skinned person are visible in the lower portion of the view. This person is wearing a bright, fluorescent yellow and dark blue garment, which they are in the process of zipping up. The person's shadow is cast onto the rocky ground ahead, forming a clear, dark silhouette of a standing human figure.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person's right hand pulls the zipper up on the left side of a yellow garment they are wearing, and then their left hand zips up the right side before moving away from their chest.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the top of a high, rocky mountain peak. The ground is a steep slope covered in loose, light-colored scree and larger boulders. Far below, a vast valley with green patches and winding paths is visible. The scene is set during the daytime under a clear sky, with bright sunlight casting a distinct shadow of the person onto the rocks in front of them. The person's hands are visible adjusting a bright yellow and blue piece of equipment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
