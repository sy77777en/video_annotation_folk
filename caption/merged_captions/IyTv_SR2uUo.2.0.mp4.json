  "merged_caption": "This is a point-of-view shot from a camera mounted on a hammerhead shark, creating a wide shot of the underwater scene with a close-up of the shark's distinctive, dark, T-shaped head visible in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The perspective is of a clear, turquoise underwater scene during the day, with sunlight filtering through the water's surface, illuminating the bright, sandy ocean floor. The camera smoothly follows the hammerhead shark from behind as it swims steadily forward, gliding over the sandy ocean floor, which moves backward in the middle ground and background. The camera moves forward continuously, panning left and right to track the shark's movement. In the middle ground at the top right, two additional gray sharks with classic, streamlined body shapes swim from left to right across the frame. In the background, several small, light-colored, silvery fish can be seen swimming. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, including the other sharks in the distance, clearly visible.",

    "Camera": "This underwater, high-angle shot smoothly follows a hammerhead shark from behind as it glides over a sandy ocean floor. The camera moves forward continuously, panning left and right to track the shark. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, including other sharks in the distance, clearly visible.",
    "Subject": "The top of a dark gray hammerhead shark's head is visible in the foreground, showcasing its distinctive wide, flat, T-shaped structure. In the mid-ground, two gray sharks with classic, streamlined body shapes swim. Multiple small, light-colored fish are visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "From a perspective just behind its head, a hammerhead shark swims steadily forward over a sandy ocean floor. In the middle ground, two additional sharks swim from the right side of the frame to the right. In the background, several fish can be seen swimming.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to a hammerhead shark, the perspective is of a clear, turquoise underwater scene during the day. The camera glides forward over a bright, sandy ocean floor, which is illuminated by sunlight filtering through the water's surface. The distinctive, dark, T-shaped head of the hammerhead is visible at the bottom of the view. In the upper right, two additional sharks swim through the water, and several small, silvery fish can be seen in the background.",
    "Spatial": "This is a point-of-view shot from a camera mounted on a hammerhead shark, creating a wide shot of the underwater scene with a close-up of the shark's head. The dark, T-shaped head of the hammerhead is fixed in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The camera glides forward smoothly, showing the sandy ocean floor moving backward in the middle ground and background. In the middle ground at the top right, two additional sharks swim from left to right across the frame. In the background, several small fish are swimming.\n"

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
