  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man with a medium build and light skin tone, wearing a dark blue suit, a white dress shirt, and a striped tie, walking through an industrial or greenhouse-like environment. He has short, gray hair and a full beard, with a neutral expression. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with his upper body and face clearly visible. The camera is positioned at eye level and angled low, looking up, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the man in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly and slowly backward, leading the man from the front as he moves forward steadily, remaining in the foreground. He occasionally turns his head to the right, appearing to observe his surroundings. The background consists of glass walls, metal structures, and overhead piping, with a high, transparent ceiling made of glass panels supported by a metal framework. The environment is well-lit, with natural light streaming through the ceiling, suggesting daytime. The overall color scheme is a mix of metallic grays and blues, with occasional warm tones from the lighting. The dynamic camera movement enhances the structured atmosphere, offering a comprehensive view of the setting. As he walks, his position shifts slightly within the frame, but he remains centered. The background elements, such as the glass ceiling and metal framework, stay static, providing a sense of depth and context to the scene. The floor is a smooth, reflective surface, and the walls are lined with large glass windows. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled low, looking up. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly and slowly backward, leading the man from the front.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build and light skin tone, wearing a dark blue suit, a white dress shirt, and a striped tie. He has short, gray hair and a full beard. His expression is neutral, and he is walking purposefully through a large, industrial-looking space with a glass ceiling and visible metal structures. The setting suggests a modern, possibly industrial or greenhouse environment.",
    "Motion": "A man in a dark blue suit, white dress shirt, and striped tie is walking forward through a large, industrial-looking space with a glass ceiling and metal structures. He occasionally turns his head to the right, appearing to observe his surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an indoor setting within a modern greenhouse or industrial facility, characterized by a high, transparent ceiling made of glass panels supported by a metal framework. The environment is well-lit, with natural light streaming through the ceiling, suggesting daytime. As the camera moves, it reveals more of the space filled with an array of pipes and metal structures, some of which run parallel to the ceiling, contributing to an industrial aesthetic. The walls are lined with large glass windows, and the floor is a smooth, reflective surface. The overall color scheme is a mix of metallic grays and blues, with occasional warm tones from the lighting. The dynamic camera movement enhances the structured atmosphere, offering a comprehensive view of the setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man walking through an industrial or greenhouse-like environment. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with his upper body and face clearly visible. He moves forward steadily, remaining in the foreground while the background consists of glass walls, metal structures, and overhead piping. The camera maintains a consistent position at the subject's eye level, capturing his movement from the front. As he walks, his position shifts slightly within the frame, but he remains centered. The background elements, such as the glass ceiling and metal framework, stay static, providing a sense of depth and context to the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
