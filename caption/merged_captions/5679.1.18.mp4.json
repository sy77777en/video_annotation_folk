  "merged_caption": "In a dynamic wide shot, a person is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on the wooden railing of a house's balcony. The camera is positioned below the subject, creating a low-angle view, and is zooming out as the person rhythmically moves both their upper body and legs, raising their hands outward in a gesturing motion. The scene is in deep focus, with dark green foliage framing the bottom, left, and top portions of the frame. A large tree trunk is also visible in the foreground on the right, further enclosing the central subject and the house. The person is wearing a red jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, brown pants, and a beige bucket hat that obscures their hair. Their legs dangle over the side of the railing as they look out from the illuminated interior of the modern-style home. Another person in black and white clothing is visible behind them, moving around. The scene depicts an outdoor setting in a lush, forested area during twilight. A modern house with large glass windows is nestled among tall trees and dense greenery. The house features warm, wooden interiors visible through the windows, illuminated by soft, hanging lights. The exterior is surrounded by vibrant green foliage, including ferns and leafy branches, creating a serene and secluded atmosphere. The sky is a deepening blue, indicating the transition from day to night. Shot from a low angle with a deep focus, this fast-motion video features a smooth, minor zoom out, keeping the entire scene sharp. The overall composition highlights the contrast between the natural environment and the cozy, inviting interior of the house.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
