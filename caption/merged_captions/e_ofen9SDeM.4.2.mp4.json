  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an elderly man positioned on the right side of the frame. He has pale, wrinkled skin, is balding on top with wispy, unkempt white hair on the sides of his head, and a very large, bushy, and wild white beard and mustache that covers the lower half of his face. He is wearing a simple grey Henley-style shirt. A dark stone wall is on the left, while the man stands in the foreground with a doorway in the background. The dim interior of the building and a window are visible behind him. The scene is set at the entrance of a building with dark, textured stone walls, characterized by a cool, desaturated color palette, lending a muted tone to the setting. The camera remains at the subject's level as the man slightly turns, making him appear larger while maintaining the medium close-up, with his face slightly to the right of the center. The camera is mostly static but exhibits some minor, unsteady shaking, suggesting a handheld perspective. A gentle breeze is evident, subtly moving the man's wispy hair and beard. He briefly looks down before his head snaps back up, his eyes widening and mouth opening slightly in a startled expression as he looks off-camera. His expression is one of concern or surprise, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth as he looks off-camera. The shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the elderly man in the foreground, while the interior of the building remains dimly lit, with the white panes of a window visible in the background.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the elderly man in the foreground. The camera is mostly static but exhibits some minor, unsteady shaking, suggesting a handheld perspective.",
    "Subject": "An elderly man with pale, wrinkled skin is shown from the chest up. He is balding on top with wispy, unkempt white hair on the sides of his head. He has a very large, bushy, and wild white beard and mustache that covers the lower half of his face. He is wearing a simple grey Henley-style shirt. His expression is one of concern or surprise, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth as he looks off-camera.",
    "Motion": "An elderly man stands in a doorway, his wispy white hair and large beard blowing in the wind. He briefly looks down before his head snaps back up, his eyes widening and mouth opening slightly in a startled expression as he looks off-camera.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at the entrance of a building with dark, textured stone walls. An elderly man with a prominent white beard stands within the doorway, looking outward. The environment is characterized by a cool, desaturated color palette, lending a muted tone to the setting. Beyond the man, the interior of the building is dimly lit, with the white panes of a window visible in the background. A gentle breeze is evident, subtly moving the man's wispy hair and beard.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an elderly man positioned on the right side of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
