  "merged_caption": "This video features a smooth, eye-level dolly shot that moves forward toward the front door, offering a dynamic perspective of the home entryway. The scene includes a dark wooden door centrally positioned, slightly ajar with a sliver of light shining from underneath, creating a sense of anticipation as the camera glides towards it. To the left of the door, a wooden console table holds a lit lamp with a white shade, two framed photographs, and a small bowl, casting long shadows across the room and onto the dark wood floor. A standing coat rack is visible in the far-left corner, and a small, framed picture hangs on the off-white wall above the table. To the right of the door, a low, light-colored wooden shoe rack holds a pair of white sneakers, positioned next to a potted plant with dark leaves. A large, vertically oriented framed artwork hangs on the wall above the shoe rack. The wooden floor and a rug enhance the foreground, creating a welcoming atmosphere as the camera advances. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire entryway sharp, and the moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation.",

    "Subject": "This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dimly lit apartment entryway at night. A dark wooden door stands slightly ajar in the center of the frame, with a bright sliver of light peeking out from the bottom. To the left, a warm glow emanates from a lamp with a white shade resting on a wooden console table, which also holds a few framed photographs. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack sits beneath a large framed piece of art, and the silhouette of a houseplant is visible in the corner. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the quiet, atmospheric environment. The moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit entryway of a home, a dark wooden door is positioned in the center, slightly ajar with light seeping from underneath. To the left of the door, a wooden console table holds a lit lamp with a white shade, two framed photographs, and a small bowl. A standing coat rack stands in the far-left corner, and a small, framed picture hangs on the off-white wall above the table. To the right of the door, a low, light-colored wooden shoe rack holds a pair of white sneakers, positioned next to a potted plant with dark leaves. A large, vertically oriented framed artwork hangs on the wall above the shoe rack. The scene is illuminated primarily by the single lamp, which casts long shadows across the room and onto the dark wood floor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
