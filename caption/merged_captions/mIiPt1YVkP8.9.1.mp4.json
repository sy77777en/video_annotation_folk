  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked commercial passenger airplane, a twin-engine jet with upward-curving winglets, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, progressing along a dark gray airport taxiway marked with a yellow centerline that curves from the bottom of the frame towards the right side of the screen. The airplane, devoid of any airline logos or markings, moves forward along the taxiway towards the right side of the screen. The camera follows the airplane's movement, tracking it by moving backward and to the right, maintaining a high-angle position and deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. In the background, a flat, green field separates the taxiway from several simple, blocky buildings visible in the distance. The entire scene is cast in a dim light under a hazy, reddish-brown sky, suggesting the time is either dawn or dusk.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly tracks the airplane, moving backward and to the right to follow its path on the tarmac.",
    "Subject": "A white, unmarked commercial passenger airplane is positioned on a dark gray airport taxiway marked with yellow lines. The aircraft is a twin-engine jet, with one engine mounted under each wing, and features upward-curving winglets at its wingtips. The entire fuselage, wings, and tail are a uniform white color, devoid of any airline logos, text, or other distinguishing markings.",
    "Motion": "A white, unmarked airplane moves along the airport taxiway towards the right side of the screen. The camera follows the airplane's movement, tracking it by moving backward and to the right.",
    "Scene": "A white, unmarked passenger airplane is moving forward along a curved section of an airport taxiway at either dawn or dusk. The dark asphalt is marked with a yellow centerline that follows the curve. In the background, a flat, green field separates the taxiway from several simple, blocky buildings in the distance. The entire scene is cast in a dim light under a hazy, reddish-brown sky.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked airplane positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, progressing along a dark gray taxiway that curves from the bottom of the frame towards the right side of the screen. In the background, a flat field and several blocky buildings are visible. The camera maintains a high-angle position, dynamically tracking the airplane by moving backward and to the right throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
