  "merged_caption": "This video features a wide scenery shot captured from a smoothly moving, level-angle perspective. Initially, a large, two-story brick building with a gabled roof is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The foreground consists of a path across the bottom of the frame, while tall grass is present in the middle ground. Trees are visible in the background on the left and right sides. The camera begins at ground level with a level angle and smoothly pedestals upward to eye level. In an outdoor scene at dusk under a dark, cloudy sky, a massive white explosion suddenly erupts from the building, expanding from the center to engulf the structure and fill most of the frame. This initial blinding white flash completely engulfs the structure and is immediately followed by fiery bursts of orange and yellow flames that shoot outwards and upwards from the building's windows and roof. The sequence shows the large, two-story brick warehouse being consumed by a massive explosion, which begins as an overwhelming white flash before transitioning into multiple fiery bursts erupting from the windows and roof, ultimately shrouding the structure in thick, dark smoke against the twilight sky. The initial blast gives way to smaller, fiery explosions before the entire structure is consumed by thick black smoke. Finally, thick black smoke billows from the central structure, obscuring the building and the lower portion of the frame, leaving the scene almost entirely dark. The scale of the fiery explosion serves as the visual centerpiece, emphasizing the action and its environmental impact, with the building eventually silhouetted in thick black smoke.",

    "Motion": "This scenery shot captures a dramatic event at dusk. A large brick building is shown exploding in a massive, bright fireball. The initial blast gives way to smaller, fiery explosions before the entire structure is consumed by thick black smoke.",

A powerful explosion erupts, initially as a blinding white flash that completely engulfs the structure. This is immediately followed by fiery bursts of orange and yellow flames and thick black smoke that billows out from the building, eventually leaving it silhouetted in thick black smoke.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
