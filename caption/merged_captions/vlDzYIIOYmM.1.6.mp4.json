  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot captured from an aerial perspective, two silhouetted figures, a taller person and a smaller child, are positioned in the center-left of the frame, both moving forward in the middle ground on a wide, wet beach. The taller individual, wearing dark clothing, walks with their right arm raised in a playful or celebratory gesture, while the smaller child, in lighter-colored clothing, follows closely, moving around the taller person with both arms raised in the air. The sun is visible on the left, low on the horizon over the ocean, casting a golden glow across the calm water and creating a bright reflection on its surface, which extends to a distant headland on the right. Wet sand reflecting the sky surrounds the figures in the middle ground, while dry sand with visible tire tracks occupies the foreground and right side of the frame. A white, smoke-like visual effect drifts across the foreground and extends to the center-right middle ground, partially obscuring the sand. This smooth, forward-moving aerial shot is captured from an overhead height at a level angle, with a large depth of field keeping the entire beach scene in sharp focus. The expansive beach is covered in wet, dark sand, which reflects the sky transitioning from yellow near the sun to a clear blue. Shallow tidal pools curve along the shoreline, and in the distance, a dark headland sits under a layer of clouds. The video, filmed by a drone, captures the serene beauty of the beach at sunrise or sunset, with the two silhouetted figures near the water's edge adding a dynamic element to the tranquil scene.",

    "Subject": "A taller person and a smaller person, likely a child, are silhouetted on a wide, wet beach at sunset. The taller individual, wearing dark clothing, walks with their right arm raised in a playful or celebratory gesture. The smaller child, who appears to be wearing lighter-colored clothing, is positioned near the taller person and moves around them on the sand.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide, sandy beach at sunrise or sunset. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a golden glow across the calm ocean and creating a bright reflection on the water's surface. The sky transitions from yellow near the sun to a clear blue. The expansive beach is covered in wet, dark sand, which reflects the sky and the sun. Tire tracks are visible in the sand, and shallow tidal pools curve along the shoreline. In the distance, a dark headland sits under a layer of clouds. Two silhouetted figures are visible near the water's edge. A white, smoke-like visual effect drifts across the lower right portion of the scene, partially obscuring the sand.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
