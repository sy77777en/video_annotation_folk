  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape from a high aerial perspective. Initially, a large body of calm, greenish-teal water extends from the foreground to the background, occupying the bottom and central parts of the frame. A tree-covered island is located in the bottom left middle ground, and a smaller island is in the middle right middle ground. A misty mountain range is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The scene is set during sunrise or sunset, with the sun peeking over the silhouetted peaks, casting warm, golden rays through a thick layer of mist. The camera slowly tilts upward, transitioning the view from a high angle of the water and islands to a more level angle, gradually revealing the full expanse of the mountain range and the glowing sky. This movement brings the sun into view at the top left, just above the mountain peaks, while the islands in the middle ground remain in their positions. The sun's ethereal sunbeams reflect softly on the water, enhancing the serene and majestic atmosphere. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The shot is intended to immerse the viewer in the serene, misty mood created by the interplay of light, water, and mountains, rather than drawing attention to a specific object or landform. The landscape itself, in its entirety, serves as the subject, conveying the immense scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. Small, tree-covered islands are scattered across the water, adding to the expansive vista. The view slowly tilts upward, revealing the full expanse of the mountainous landscape receding into the distance.",

    "Camera": "This is a slow, smooth aerial shot where the camera pedestals and tilts upward. This movement transitions the view from a high angle of the water and islands to a more level angle, revealing the sun setting behind the distant mountains. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a dramatic range of mountains. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a low sun, which peeks over the silhouetted peaks and casts ethereal sunbeams through a thick layer of mist, reflecting softly on the calm, greenish-teal water below. Small, tree-covered islands are scattered across the water, adding to the serene and expansive vista. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the immense scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The shot is intended to immerse the viewer in the serene, misty mood created by the interplay of light, water, and mountains, rather than drawing attention to a specific object or landform. The landscape itself, in its entirety, serves as the subject.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, aerial shot of a vast, misty lake surrounded by mountains at either sunrise or sunset. The sun peeks over the mountain range, casting a warm, golden light and dramatic rays through the haze. Small, tree-covered islands dot the calm, reflective water, creating a serene and majestic atmosphere.\n\nThe camera slowly tilts upward, gradually revealing the full expanse of the mountain range and the glowing sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a layered mountain range. The scene is set during sunrise or sunset, with the sun glowing brightly above the silhouetted peaks and casting golden rays through a hazy atmosphere. The calm, dark green water reflects the sky's warm light. Small, tree-covered islands are dotted across the water. The view slowly tilts upward, revealing the full expanse of the mountainous landscape receding into the distance.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape from a high aerial perspective. Initially, a large body of water extends from the foreground to the background, occupying the bottom and central parts of the frame. A tree-covered island is located in the bottom left middle ground, and a smaller island is in the middle right middle ground. A misty mountain range is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera slowly tilts upward, revealing more of the expansive mountain range and the sky. This movement brings the sun into view at the top left, just above the mountain peaks, while the islands in the middle ground remain in their positions."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
