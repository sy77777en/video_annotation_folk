  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as a high-angle extreme wide shot of a sprawling, modern industrial or high-security complex, likely a digital rendering. The scene begins with a soft blur and transitions into sharp focus, revealing a large industrial complex with a muted, monochromatic color scheme. Two long buildings with gray, corrugated, arched roofs extend from the midground to the background, occupying the left and center of the frame. A road runs almost horizontally across the bottom of the frame. On the right, several parallel roadways extend from the foreground into the background, running alongside the main buildings. The ground is a dark, textured gray. From a high, aerial angle, the shot begins out of focus before racking into a deep focus on the large industrial complex. As the image sharpens, the smooth drone camera pulls backward and upward while rolling slightly counterclockwise, revealing more of the buildings and adjacent roads. The scene features two massive, parallel buildings with curved, corrugated metal roofs, surrounded by a meticulously planned network of roads and what appear to be multiple security barriers. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to establish the vast scale and sterile, geometric layout of the environment. The focus on the overall design and the monochromatic color palette creates an impersonal and imposing atmosphere.",

    "Motion": "This is a high-angle scenery shot of a 3D architectural model. The model depicts a large complex with several long buildings featuring curved, corrugated metal roofs. Multiple parallel roads or tracks run alongside the buildings.",
    "Scene": "A high-angle, rendered view shows a large industrial complex with a muted, monochromatic color scheme. The shot transitions from a soft blur into sharp focus, revealing two long buildings with gray, corrugated, arched roofs. These structures are surrounded by a network of black asphalt roads with white lane markings. To the right of the buildings, several parallel roadways run alongside the complex. The ground is a dark, textured gray.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
