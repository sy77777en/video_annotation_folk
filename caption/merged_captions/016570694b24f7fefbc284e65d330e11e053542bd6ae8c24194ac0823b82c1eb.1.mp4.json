  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, positioned centrally on a dark countertop. The mug, featuring a handle and a small red label with black text that appears to read \"NacRom,\" is in the foreground, while the background consists of blurred shelves or cabinets, suggesting an indoor setting, likely a kitchen or café. Initially, the camera is positioned above the mug, capturing the entire drink and its distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk, topped with frothy foam. The lighting is soft, indicating an ambient indoor light source. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward and downward, tilting up to achieve a level angle as it approaches the cup, with focus tracking keeping the coffee cup sharp. The details of the drink become more pronounced, showing the distinct layers. On the right side of the frame, a small cup, likely containing espresso, is placed down, and the coffee liquid in the glass mug blends downward with the milk. The shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the mug and its contents, with the camera moving to the subject's level. This change in perspective emphasizes the visual appeal of the layered drink. The camera is slightly shaky, suggesting handheld shooting. Towards the end, the camera remains at the same level as the subject, and the shot size transitions to a full shot of the mug. As the camera pulls away, the entire frame becomes out of focus, maintaining the overall warm and inviting atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a high-angle view, looking down at a cup of coffee. The camera moves forward and downward, tilting up to achieve a level angle as it approaches the cup. The focus is ultra-shallow, with focus tracking keeping the coffee cup sharp. The camera is slightly shaky, suggesting handheld shooting. At the end, as the camera pulls away, the entire frame becomes out of focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, likely a latte, characterized by distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. The mug has a handle and a small red label on its side with black text that appears to read \"NacRom.\" The beverage is topped with a small amount of foam, and the glass is positioned on a dark countertop. The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, featuring a prominent layer of milk foam on top, placed on a dark countertop. As the camera moves closer, the details of the drink become more pronounced, showing the distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. On the right side of the frame, a small cup, likely containing espresso, is placed down. The coffee liquid in the glass mug blends downward with the milk. ",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a kitchen or café, featuring a glass mug filled with a layered coffee drink. The mug is placed on a dark countertop, and the drink displays distinct layers of milk and coffee, topped with frothy foam. The glass has a small red emblem on its side. The background includes a blurred view of shelves or cabinets, suggesting a warm, cozy environment. The lighting is soft, indicating an ambient indoor light source, with no specific time of day discernible. The scene remains focused on the drink, with a slight change in focus towards the end, maintaining the overall warm and inviting atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
