  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot featuring a red soccer cleat in the bottom left foreground and the left portion of a yellow soccer ball in the right foreground. The cleat is vibrant red with a textured, honeycomb-like pattern and a prominent white Nike swoosh on the outer side, while the yellow ball features large black graphic patterns, a black Nike swoosh, the word \"STRIKE,\" and the number \"90\" enclosed within a circle. Both the cleats and the ball are covered in water droplets, resting on a green, grassy field at night as rain falls steadily. The camera, positioned at ground level with a shallow depth of field, focuses on the Nike soccer ball and cleats in the foreground. It executes a smooth, clockwise arc around the ball while pulling back, employing a speed ramp effect: the motion begins slowly, accelerates rapidly, and then stops abruptly. This transition reveals a full shot of the complete arrangement, with the first cleat fully visible in the bottom left foreground, a second cleat lying on its side in the top left foreground, and the entire soccer ball occupying the right-center foreground. The second cleat, partially obscured behind the first cleat and the ball, lies on its side, revealing its white-tipped studs. The scene is illuminated by a bright, overhead light against a dark background, highlighting the wet surfaces of the cleats and the ball. All three subjects remain stationary on the green, grassy surface at the bottom of the frame, with the camera maintaining its level angle throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "A pair of bright red Nike soccer cleats and a yellow Nike soccer ball rest on a green, grassy surface. The soccer ball, positioned on the right, is yellow with large black graphic patterns. It features a black Nike swoosh, the word \"STRIKE,\" and the number \"90\" enclosed within a circle. The cleats are a vibrant red with a textured, honeycomb-like pattern and a prominent white Nike swoosh on the outer side. One cleat is upright in the foreground, with its white-tipped studs visible, while the other cleat lies on its side, partially obscured behind the first cleat and the ball. Both the ball and the cleats are covered in water droplets.",
    "Motion": "The red soccer cleats and the yellow soccer ball remain stationary on the grass throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "A pair of wet, red soccer cleats and a yellow soccer ball rest on a green, grassy field at night. Rain falls steadily, coating the textured surface of the cleats and the panels of the ball with water droplets. The cleats feature a white Nike swoosh, and one is positioned upright while the other lies on its side, revealing its white-tipped studs. The yellow ball, also branded with a black Nike swoosh and the number \"90,\" sits next to the cleats. The scene is illuminated by a bright, overhead light against a dark background.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a close-up shot featuring a red soccer cleat in the bottom left foreground and the left portion of a yellow soccer ball in the right foreground. The camera then executes a smooth, clockwise arc around the ball while pulling back, transitioning into a full shot that reveals the complete arrangement. In the final frame, the first cleat is fully visible in the bottom left foreground, a second cleat is lying on its side in the top left foreground, and the entire soccer ball occupies the right-center foreground. All three subjects are situated on a green, grassy surface at the bottom of the frame, with the camera positioned at their level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
