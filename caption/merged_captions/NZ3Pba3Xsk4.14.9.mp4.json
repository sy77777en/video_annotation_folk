  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a large portion of the enclosed garden area from an elevated camera angle above the main subject, a medium-sized animal with reddish-brown fur, a long bushy tail, and a dark face with distinctive white markings, identified as a red panda. Positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, the red panda moves from the right-center toward the top right beside a large fallen branch that runs diagonally through the scene. The garden area is well-maintained, featuring a variety of green plants, small trees, and patches of grass, with the ground comprising grass, soil, and worn paths. Several large, natural-looking logs are placed horizontally across the space, and metal structures with vertical and horizontal bars, painted dark brown or black, are positioned throughout, forming climbing frames and supporting platforms with wooden steps and surfaces. The background includes a tall stone wall, metal fencing, and sections of light-colored paneling, indicating the perimeter of the enclosure. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting daytime with clear weather. As the red panda walks across the grassy area, the camera, initially positioned at eye level with a high angle, smoothly pans right and tilts up to a level angle to follow the animal’s movement. Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion to continue tracking the red panda from the side, resulting in the red panda becoming smaller in the frame. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking. The red panda continues moving to the right, passing behind foliage and wooden structures, eventually disappearing from view behind these elements. The bottom of the foreground reveals a section of the glass enclosure.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle, looking down at the red panda. As the red panda moves right and away, the camera smoothly pans right and tilts up to a level angle, following the animal’s movement. Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion to continue tracking the red panda from the side, resulting in the red panda becoming smaller in the frame.

    "Subject": "The video shows a medium-sized animal with reddish-brown fur, a long bushy tail, and a dark face with distinctive white markings moving through a grassy area with scattered plants and wooden structures. The animal, which appears to be a red panda based on its distinctive coloration and tail, climbs along a large fallen branch and then continues moving until it disappears from view behind foliage and structures.",
    "Motion": "The animal walks across the grassy area, moves past a large fallen branch, and continues walking until it disappears from view behind plants and wooden structures.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a well-maintained, enclosed garden area with a variety of green plants, small trees, and patches of grass. The ground is a mix of grass, soil, and some worn paths, with several large, natural-looking logs placed horizontally across the space. Metal structures with vertical and horizontal bars, painted dark brown or black, are positioned throughout the area, some forming climbing frames and others supporting platforms with wooden steps and surfaces. The background includes a tall stone wall, metal fencing, and sections of light-colored paneling, indicating the perimeter of the enclosure. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting daytime with clear weather. No overlays such as text or icons are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a large portion of the enclosed garden area from an elevated camera angle above the main subject. A medium-sized animal is positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, moving from the right-center toward the top right beside a large fallen branch that runs diagonally through the scene. The animal remains in the middle ground as it moves, while metal climbing structures with vertical and horizontal bars are visible in the middle ground, mostly on the left and right sides of the frame. Green plants, small trees, and patches of grass fill the middle ground, with a tall stone wall and metal fencing forming the background along the top edge of the frame. As the animal continues moving to the right, it passes behind foliage and wooden structures, eventually disappearing from view behind these elements. Throughout the video, the camera changes height and angle, smoothly panning right and tilting up to a level angle to follow the animal’s movement. Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion to continue tracking the animal from the side. The bottom of the foreground reveals a section of the glass enclosure."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
