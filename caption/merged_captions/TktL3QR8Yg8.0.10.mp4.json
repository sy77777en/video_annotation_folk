  "merged_caption": "This close-up, top-down shot initially frames a piece of beige paper with a chaotic drawing of a black-and-red monster in the center-left middle ground, set on a dark, multi-colored, textured rug. A right hand in the foreground is positioned over the drawing in the top-right quadrant, while a left hand, also in the foreground, holds the paper's edge at the bottom-left. Several red perforated metal discs, small metal washers, a screw, and a bottle cap are scattered around the paper. The right hand lifts a red, perforated metal disc away from the drawing but remains in the frame. Both hands then move together to grasp a reddish-brown box, which occupies nearly the entire frame. As the hands lift the lid, the open box, filled with various keepsakes, becomes the focal point. Inside the box are a small brass compass, two colored spinning tops, old black-and-white photographs, handwritten letters with legible Spanish handwriting, stamps, a rusty metal disc with several holes and a noticeable crack, and other small trinkets. The hands remain in the foreground on either side of the box, while the original drawing is now partially visible in the bottom-left corner. From a high angle, this shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly trucks right and moves forward with a slight clockwise roll, revealing the contents of the box filled with mementos. One hand then moves slightly over the items in the box, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",

    "Subject": "From a top-down perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands in a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt interacts with a collection of items on a textured surface. Initially, the hands are near a piece of beige paper featuring a child's drawing in black with a hint of red crayon, depicting an exaggerated, scraggly monster. Several red perforated metal discs and round metal washers are scattered on the paper. The hands then move to open a rectangular, reddish-brown box, revealing its contents. Inside the box is an assortment of objects, including a small brass compass, two colored spinning tops, some old black-and-white photographs, handwritten letters with legible Spanish handwriting, a rusty metal disc with several holes and a noticeable crack, and other small trinkets.",
    "Motion": "From a top-down view, a hand lifts a red, perforated metal disc away from a child's drawing. The hands then move together to grasp a reddish-brown box and lift its lid, revealing the contents inside. One hand then moves slightly over the items in the box.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot captures a top-down view of a scene set on a dark, multi-colored, textured rug. Initially, a chaotic drawing of a black-and-red monster on aged paper is visible, surrounded by several red perforated metal discs, small metal washers, a screw, and a bottle cap. A pair of hands moves from the drawing to open a dark red, rectangular box, revealing a collection of keepsakes. Inside the box are various items, including a small compass, two wooden spinning tops, old black-and-white photographs, handwritten letters in Spanish, stamps, and other small trinkets.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
