  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a man skateboarding, captured at his level, whose position within the frame shifts dynamically. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, and white socks, with black Vans shoes that have white stripes, a black beanie on his head, and tattoos visible on his left arm. Initially, the skateboarder occupies the center-left foreground, moving towards the center. A grey SUV is visible in the right middle ground, alongside a building with a red awning in the right middle ground, and a taller grey building further back in the center-right background. The left middle ground and background feature parked cars and trees. The man starts by skateboarding down a street lined with parked cars and trees, approaching a set of stairs. The camera, positioned at ground level with noticeable fisheye distortion, initially captures him at a low angle looking up, then transitions to a level angle as it moves. The skateboarder then moves to the center middle ground as he jumps over a short flight of concrete steps located in the right foreground. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, moving forward and tracking the skateboarder from behind while arcing around him from one side to the other, with noticeable shaking. He successfully jumps over the stairs, maintaining balance in mid-air. After landing, he continues to skateboard smoothly on the sidewalk, adjusting his stance to maintain balance. He rides along the sidewalk, transitioning from the center middle ground, past a silver sedan in the left middle ground, towards the center foreground, and then slightly to the left foreground. As the camera follows his movement, he remains in a full shot but becomes more prominent in the frame when closer. Additional parked vehicles and trees line the middle ground on both sides of the sidewalk, with urban buildings forming the background.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at ground level, initially at a low angle looking up at the skateboarder, then transitioning to a level angle as it moves. A Dutch angle is present and varies due to camera rolling. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. Throughout the video, the camera moves forward, tracking the skateboarder from behind while arcing around them from one side to the other. This movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, and white socks, with black Vans shoes that have white stripes. A black beanie is on his head, and tattoos are visible on his left arm. He is riding a skateboard that has a black deck and light-colored wheels.",
    "Motion": "The man starts by skateboarding down a street lined with parked cars and trees, approaching a set of stairs. He crouches down and prepares to jump, lifting the skateboard off the ground. He successfully jumps over the stairs, maintaining balance in mid-air. After landing, he continues to skateboard smoothly on the sidewalk, adjusting his stance to maintain balance. He skates past several pedestrians, who are observing him as he continues down the sidewalk, passing by more parked cars and trees.",
    "Scene": "An objective POV shot captures an outdoor urban scene from a detached, observational perspective, set on a daytime residential street. A skateboarder navigates the sidewalk running alongside the asphalt road, which is lined with many parked cars, including a grey SUV and a silver sedan. Multiple apartment buildings are clearly visible in the frame. At the beginning of the video, on the right side, the entrance of the first, slightly shorter building features a red awning marked with the number '1769.' Behind it stands a taller gray building with a stairway at the entrance that has black handrails. The sidewalk features a brick-lined curb and a short flight of concrete steps. Trees line the walkway, and palm trees can be seen in the background under a bright sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
