  "merged_caption": "This wide shot shows a man in the center-left of the middle ground, holding a white bag and wading through knee-deep floodwater that covers the foreground and middle ground. A child with dark skin and dark hair, wearing a light purple dress, is seated on a makeshift raft in the center of the middle ground, with an orange, white, and green basket to their left, on the right side of the frame. In the center-right of the middle ground, a woman with dark skin, wearing a dark red or maroon saree, stands in the doorway of a house which occupies the background across the frame. The house features a facade decorated with rectangular tiles in shades of brown and beige, arranged in a brick-like pattern, and has a covered porch with a curved archway. Green foliage is visible in the background on the far right. The camera is positioned above the water, maintaining a level angle with a fixed Dutch angle throughout. It employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. At the beginning, the camera moves quickly and smoothly with minimal shaking, first executing a light pan to the right before rapidly zooming out. The man, carrying a white bag, wades through the water, moving towards the entrance of the house. The woman stands in the doorway, observing the outside, while the child sits on a partially submerged raft near the entrance. The murky brown water reaches the lower portion of the building, and sunlight casts shadows, indicating clear weather. The camera captures the scene during the daytime in a flooded area directly in front of the house, with the subjects' level maintained throughout.",

    "Subject": "A shirtless man with dark skin, wearing light green lower garments, stands in murky floodwater, holding a large white bag. Near him, a small child with dark skin and dark hair, wearing a light purple dress, sits on a makeshift flotation device in the water, next to an orange, white, and green basket. In the doorway of a house with a patterned tiled facade, a woman with dark skin, wearing a dark red or maroon saree, observes the outside, looking at the water. The lower portion of the house is submerged in the brown floodwater.",
    "Motion": "A man, carrying a white bag, wades through knee-deep water, moving towards the entrance of a house. A woman stands in the doorway, observing the outside, while a child sits on a partially submerged raft near the entrance.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds outdoors during the daytime, in a flooded area directly in front of a house. Murky brown water covers the ground, reaching the lower portion of the building. The house features a facade decorated with rectangular tiles in shades of brown and beige, arranged in a brick-like pattern, and has a covered porch with a curved archway. A wooden door and window are visible. Sunlight casts shadows, indicating clear weather. A man wades through the water carrying a white bag. Near the doorway, a woman stands, and a child sits on a bundle of items, including a colorful fabric, placed on wooden planks or bamboo acting as a makeshift raft. An orange plastic bucket with accents of white and green floats in the water, and some green foliage is visible to the side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
