  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot, viewed from an angle, of a white, textured plate occupying the center foreground, resting on a marble-like surface visible in the background. On the plate, two slices of avocado toast are positioned. One slice, topped with red tomato slices, is in the top left of the plate. The second slice, initially just with mashed avocado, is in the bottom right of the plate. A light-skinned hand enters from the top right of the frame, moving into the foreground to place sliced brown mushrooms onto the avocado spread of the bottom right toast. The hand begins placing the mushrooms, starting from the top of the bread and moving downwards, arranging them in neat rows. The hand sequentially arranges the mushrooms in four columns, starting from the right edge of the toast and moving towards the left, with two mushrooms in each column, ensuring they are evenly spaced. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the plate of avocado toast. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both pieces of toast and the hand adding mushrooms sharp. The camera is fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movements. The hand finishes placing the mushrooms, completing the arrangement on the toast.",

    "Subject": "The video shows two slices of avocado toast on a white, textured plate. Both slices consist of brown bread topped with a layer of mashed green avocado. \nOne slice is covered with overlapping slices of red tomato. A light-skinned hand places sliced brown mushrooms one by one onto the avocado spread on the second slice of toast closest to the camera, arranging them in neat rows.\n\n",
    "Motion": "The video shows two slices of avocado toast on a white, textured plate. The first slice is already topped with slices of red tomato. A hand begins placing sliced brown mushrooms onto the second slice of toast, starting from the top of the bread and moving downwards. The hand continues to place the mushrooms in neat rows, ensuring they are evenly spaced. The hand finishes placing the mushrooms, completing the arrangement on the toast.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors, showing a white plate with a textured pattern resting on a marble-like surface. On the plate are two slices of toast topped with mashed green avocado. One slice is further decorated with round, red tomato slices. Throughout the video, a hand carefully arranges sliced, brown mushrooms in rows on the second slice of avocado toast.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
