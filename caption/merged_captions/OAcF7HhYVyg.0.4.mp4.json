  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot centers on a person in a yeti costume in the foreground, who remains in the central portion of the frame throughout the video. The person is shown snowboarding while wearing a full-body, white, furry costume resembling a yeti, complete with a mask featuring a wide-open mouth displaying large, sharp teeth, and two horns, one on each side of the head. They wear large, yellow-lensed ski goggles over the mask and a black backpack harness over the furry suit. In the middle ground and background, a snow-covered mountain is visible on the left and right, with a clear blue sky filling the top of the frame. The scene unfolds on a bright, sunny day as the snowboarder passes through plumes of white powder snow. This slow-motion video is filmed from a low-angle, eye-level selfie perspective, with the camera facing the person in the yeti costume snowboarding down the mountain. The camera moves backward, leading the snowboarder from the front as they descend. The shot is slightly unsteady with some shaking. From a low-angle perspective, the person snowboards down the mountain, moving through a spray of powder that flies past the camera. They slightly lean into their turns while descending the snowy slope, maintaining a forward posture under a clear blue sky. As the person snowboards, the camera, positioned at their level, moves with them, keeping them centered while the mountain scenery passes by. Plumes of snow float near a spot, flying through the foreground and middle ground around the person as they pass through it. A deep focus keeps both the snowboarder and the snowy mountain background sharp. From the foreground to the background, the expansive, snowy mountain range stretches into the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
