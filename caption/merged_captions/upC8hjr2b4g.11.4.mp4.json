  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame and facing towards the left of the frame. The figure has a smooth, white surface with geometric contours, resembling a stylized human form, and is dressed in a two-toned outfit, combining dark and light shades that accentuate its angular design. Its hands are placed on the sides of its thighs. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, using deep focus with a large depth of field to keep all elements sharp. The camera gradually moves closer to the subject smoothly without any shaking, focusing on the seated figure in the middle ground. In the background, a wooden table is centered behind the figure, and a cabinet is located further back on the right. Multiple large, illuminated screens extend from the foreground to the background on the right side of the frame, with an empty chair next to them. In the foreground at the bottom left corner, a chair is visible. On the left, a dark rug is visible on the floor in the background. The environment features a tiled floor and a simple, uncluttered layout. The lighting is cool and focused, casting shadows and highlighting the figure's geometric form. The atmosphere is quiet and still, with no visible movement or changes. Overlay elements include a small, unobtrusive watermark labeled as \"[26]\" in the lower left corner, which is not part of the scene. The background includes a wooden table, a cabinet with a reflective surface, and a large screen on the right wall.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly without any shaking, focusing on the seated figure in the middle ground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in a dimly lit room. The figure has a smooth, white surface with geometric contours, resembling a stylized human form. The camera is positioned to the left and slightly behind the figure, which is turned slightly towards its right side. Its hands are placed on the sides of its thighs. The figure is dressed in a two-toned outfit, combining dark and light shades that accentuate its angular design.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in a dimly lit room, with the camera gradually moving closer to the figure. The figure remains stationary throughout the sequence, with its hands positioned on the sides of its thighs and its body facing slightly to the right. The background includes a wooden table, a cabinet with a reflective surface, and a large screen on the right wall. The lighting highlights the figure's geometric design and the contrast between the dark and light shades of its outfit.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, dimly lit room. The environment features a tiled floor and a simple, uncluttered layout. A mannequin-like figure is seated on a chair in the center, facing to the left of the frame. The room includes a wooden table with a reflective surface and a cabinet in the background. The lighting is cool and focused, casting shadows and highlighting the figure's geometric form. The atmosphere is quiet and still, with no visible movement or changes.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
