  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on the environment. Initially, the scene is framed through a large window frame in the foreground, looking down a long, symmetrical hallway that occupies the center of the frame and extends from the middle ground to the background. The camera begins at an elevated position outside the window, tilts slightly downward as it passes through the opening, and then glides along the floor, accelerating toward the end. As it advances, the foreground window frame moves out of view, revealing the full length of the corridor. The hallway is lined with doors on the left and right sides, which move from the middle ground or background toward the foreground and then past the camera. Some doors are open while others are closed, transitioning as the camera moves past them. A bright, rectangular light source is positioned at the far end of the hall in the center of the background, serving as a constant vanishing point that grows larger as the camera moves toward it. The corridor features a dark, polished, and reflective floor, with dimly lit, light-colored walls. The bright light at the far end creates a strong silhouette and casts long shadows, with slivers of light seeping from beneath the doors, illuminating the hallway. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood. A static white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, ground-level shot where the camera moves forward through a long hallway. The shot begins at an elevated position outside a window, tilts slightly downward as it passes through the opening, and then glides along the floor, accelerating toward the end. A deep focus keeps the entire hallway sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot, moving forward through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous identical doors on either side, with some doors open and others closed. Slivers of light seep from beneath these doors, illuminating the hallway. The floor is dark and highly reflective, mirroring the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the very end of the hall. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using the strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye through the space itself, making the atmosphere and the journey toward the light the central experience. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a long, dark hallway with a polished, reflective floor. Doors line both sides of the corridor, and a bright light at the far end creates a strong silhouette and casts long shadows. The camera pushes forward down the length of the hall.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a forward-moving perspective down a long, symmetrical indoor hallway with a monochromatic color scheme. The corridor features a dark, polished, and reflective floor, with dimly lit, light-colored walls lined on both sides by a series of identical doors. Initially, some doors are open while others are closed, but they quickly transition between open and closed as the camera moves past them. A bright, rectangular light source at the far end of the hall creates a strong backlight, casting long shadows and creating bright highlights on the door frames. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
