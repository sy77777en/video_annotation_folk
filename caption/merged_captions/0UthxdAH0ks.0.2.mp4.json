  "merged_caption": "The video features a forward-moving camera capturing a long, dimly lit indoor facility with a high, arched structure resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, employing deep focus with a large depth of field to keep all elements sharp. A black dog is prominently featured in the center of the frame in the middle ground, barking at the camera, while the animals in the pens, likely pigs, appear to be eating. The camera moves slowly forward along the corridor, which is lined with metal railings on both sides, extending from the foreground to the background, with the far end visible at the center of the frame. Transparent panels on the sides allow a view of the outdoors, indicating an overcast day. The lower half of the frame shows the ground and railings, while the upper half features the arched ceiling. The interior is divided into different sections by metal railings, suggesting an organized, utilitarian design typical of a large, industrial livestock farm. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, overlaying the scene without altering the spatial composition, displaying text in both Chinese and English, such as \"Keep going!\" and \"Stop acting like pigs!\" These overlays are not part of the physical environment. The focus is on the scale, repetitive structure, and atmosphere of the location, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera moves slowly forward with smooth, minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video captures the interior of a long, dimly lit, arched barn filled with rows of pig pens. A black dog is prominently featured in the center, barking at the camera, while the surrounding pens contain animals, likely pigs. The focus is on the scale, repetitive structure, and atmosphere of the location.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a large, dimly lit indoor facility with a high, arched ceiling and rows of animal pens on either side. A black dog is barking in the center, and the animals in the pens, likely pigs, appear to be eating.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a large, industrial livestock farm. The environment features a long, arched ceiling, while the sides are transparent, allowing a view of the outdoors. The interior is divided into different sections by metal railings, likely for pig farming, suggesting an organized, utilitarian design. The atmosphere is dim, indicating an overcast day. The scene includes motion, with a black dog barking. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying text in both Chinese and English, such as \"Keep going!\" and \"Stop acting like pigs!\" These overlays are not part of the physical environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
