  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a first-person perspective, positioned at the height of a suspension bridge. The bridge originates at the bottom of the frame in the foreground and extends toward the center of the middle ground. Its woven rope railings on the left and right sides create leading lines that draw the eye forward. Tall trees populate the middle ground and background, flanking the bridge on both sides. In the middle ground, other wooden platforms are visible built around the trees, with one to the left and another directly ahead in the center. The camera moves forward along the bridge with some shakiness, causing the destination platform in the center to appear closer while the foreground elements recede. From a level angle, the slightly unsteady camera moves forward along the rope bridge. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the bridge in the foreground and the trees in the background sharp. This video presents a forest scenery shot from the first-person perspective of someone walking across a long suspension bridge high up in a dense canopy of towering, thick-trunked trees. The bridge features a narrow wooden plank walkway, flanked on both sides by high, woven rope netting that serves as a railing. In the distance, other wooden platforms and smaller connecting bridges can be seen built around the massive trees, forming an extensive treetop walkway. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on conveying the immersive experience and the grand scale of the forest environment from an elevated viewpoint. The camera's steady forward motion along the bridge draws the viewer into the scene, emphasizing the atmosphere of being suspended amidst the ancient trees. The surrounding forest is filled with lush green foliage, and the scene is illuminated by soft, diffused daylight filtering through the high canopy.",

    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from the perspective of someone on a rope and wood suspension bridge. The bridge stretches between platforms built high up on massive trees in a lush, green forest. The camera looks forward along the length of the bridge toward another platform.",
    "Scene": "A narrow suspension bridge with a wooden plank walkway and sides made of thick, light-colored rope netting extends forward into a dense forest. The bridge connects elevated wooden platforms built around the massive, dark trunks of tall coniferous trees. The surrounding forest is filled with lush green foliage, and the scene is illuminated by soft, diffused daylight filtering through the high canopy.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
