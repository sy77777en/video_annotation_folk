  "merged_caption": "A middle-aged man with light skin and a balding head with short, dark hair on the sides is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned centrally in the foreground. He is wearing a light blue, button-down, collared shirt and is seated, initially looking slightly to his right before turning his gaze to face the camera directly, maintaining a serious expression. The camera is static, positioned at eye level and at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field with the focus on the man in the foreground. Behind him, a portion of a brown leather couch is visible in the middle ground, extending across the lower part of the frame. The background features a room with rustic wooden paneling on the walls; a white sink with silver faucets and a small bonsai tree in a dark pot are situated in the top left of the background. To the right, a window offers a view of a bright, sunlit outdoor area with green foliage. On a surface near the window, there are stacked books, a small, light-brown wooden birdhouse-like object, and a small, golden, decorative item. The overall lighting suggests it is daytime. The man remains relatively static within this framing.",

    "Subject": "A middle-aged man with light skin and a balding head with short, dark hair on the sides is shown from the chest up. He is wearing a light blue, button-down, collared shirt and is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. He is seated.",
    "Motion": "The man, seated, initially looks slightly to his right. He then turns his gaze to face the camera directly, maintaining a serious expression.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a room with rustic wooden paneling on the walls. A brown leather couch is visible in the middle ground. In the background, a white sink with silver faucets is mounted on the wooden wall, with a small bonsai tree in a dark pot to its left. To the right, a window offers a view of a bright, sunlit outdoor area with green foliage.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
