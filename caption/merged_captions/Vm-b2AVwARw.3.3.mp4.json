  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, focusing on a prominent skyscraper centrally positioned in the frame. This tower, with its dark, reflective facade and distinctive curved design, is situated in the middle ground, dominating the scene. Surrounding the skyscraper are various high-rise buildings, positioned in the background, creating a dense skyline. The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view of a cityscape. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, arcing counterclockwise around a central skyscraper. The video is a cityscape scenery shot, showcasing a sprawling urban environment with a focus on a prominent, sleek skyscraper at its center. The tower features a dark, reflective facade with a distinctive, curved design that tapers towards the top, crowned by a metallic structure. Surrounding the skyscraper are numerous other high-rise buildings, varying in height and architectural style, creating a dense and dynamic skyline. The scene captures the essence of a bustling metropolis, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the urban landscape rather than focusing on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the grandeur and intricacy of the city as a whole. A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of a modern cityscape model at either dawn or dusk, characterized by soft lighting and elongated shadows. Dominating the center is a tall, slender skyscraper with a dark, possibly metallic or glass facade, featuring a distinctive twisting design that culminates in a pointed apex. The surface of this central tower appears to have a pattern due to light passing through its hollow design. Surrounding this prominent structure are numerous abstract, three-dimensional models of buildings in varying heights and contemporary designs, including cylindrical and rectangular forms, rendered in muted tones of grey and light brown. The urban layout includes visible road networks, patches of undeveloped or green land, and bodies of water, such as canals or lakes, which reflect the sky.",

This tower, with its dark, reflective facade and distinctive curved design, is situated in the middle ground, dominating the scene. Surrounding the skyscraper are various high-rise buildings, positioned in the background, creating a dense skyline. The camera, positioned above the city, captures the urban environment from a high vantage point, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the metropolis. The shot remains consistent, maintaining the skyscraper's central position and the surrounding buildings' arrangement, highlighting the grandeur of the cityscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
