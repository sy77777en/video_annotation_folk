  "merged_caption": "This is a medium close-up shot of a man with curly brown hair, a mustache, and light skin, positioned in the center foreground, wearing a light blue, fuzzy, open-front cardigan over a white undershirt and a gold chain necklace. His head is slightly tilted to his left, corresponding to the right side of the frame, as he appears to be speaking or singing while looking directly at the camera. The camera is at eye level, employing a high angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a dark background. In the background on the left side of the frame, a gold-colored shelf-like structure is visible, holding a blurred vase and two white cylindrical objects. A patterned object, possibly the leg of a seated person wearing patterned pants, is located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. On the right side of the frame, smoke is visible in the foreground, suggesting that the man might be smoking, and an orange object is situated in the middle ground. Behind the male lead, there is a blurred, golden, rack-like structure holding two white cylindrical objects and an item resembling a patterned flowerpot.",

    "Subject": "A man with curly brown hair, a mustache, and light skin is shown from the chest up, looking directly at the camera with his head slightly tilted to his left. He is wearing a light blue, fuzzy, open-front cardigan over a white undershirt and a gold chain necklace. Visible smoke on the right side of the frame suggests that the man might be smoking.",
    "Motion": "The man appears to be speaking or singing while looking directly at the camera, his head slightly tilted to his left.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with a dark background. Behind the male lead, there is a blurred, golden, rack-like structure holding two white cylindrical objects and an item resembling a patterned flowerpot. On the left, a patterned object, which appears to be the leg of a seated person wearing patterned pants, is partially visible. Additionally, on the right side of the frame's background, there is an orange object.",
    "Spatial": "This is a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. His head is slightly tilted to his left, which corresponds to the right side of the frame. In the background on the left side of the frame, a gold-colored shelf-like structure is visible, holding a vase and two white cylindrical objects, all of which are blurred. A patterned object, possibly a leg, is located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. On the right side of the frame, smoke is visible in the foreground, in front of the man, and an orange object is situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
