  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a red and yellow taxi cab in the bottom left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The sedan-style car has a red lower body and a yellow upper section around the windows, with an illuminated yellow car topper sign extending from the front to the back of the roof. The car's headlights and red taillights are on. Initially, a low concrete barrier is visible in the foreground, while another barrier runs parallel in the middle ground on the opposite side of the taxi. Blurred city lights occupy the background, appearing as horizontal streaks of white and red against the dark urban landscape. The camera, positioned at the taxi's level, tracks the vehicle as it moves from left to right across a road at night. The slightly unsteady camera begins at a level angle, transitions to a high angle, and then returns to a level angle as it pans right, tilting down and then up to follow the taxi. As the taxi follows a curve in the road and moves away from the camera, the perspective shifts to a rear view, and the shot transitions into a wide shot. The car becomes smaller as it travels toward the center of the frame and deeper into the background, navigating the curve in the road. The taxi speeds along a highway, driving alongside a low concrete barrier on a dark-paved road. The camera's motion blur makes the specific focus difficult to determine, but it effectively captures the dynamic movement of the taxi as it continues to drive away, with the distant city lights providing a contrasting backdrop to the vehicle's illuminated sign and lights.",

    "Subject": "A red and yellow taxi cab is shown driving at night. The sedan-style car has a red lower body and a yellow upper section around the windows. An illuminated yellow car topper sign, extending from the front to the back of the roof, is mounted on top. The car's headlights and red taillights are on.",
    "Motion": "A red and yellow taxi cab drives from left to right across a road at night. The camera pans to follow the vehicle. The perspective then shifts to a rear view as the taxi continues to drive away from the camera and navigates a curve in the road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
