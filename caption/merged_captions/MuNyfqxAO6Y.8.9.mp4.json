  "merged_caption": "A low-angle, close-up shot frames the interior of a car's A-pillar and door, featuring a two-tone color scheme with a dark, forest-green material and a contrasting salmon-pink or terracotta-colored suede panel set into the driver-side door in the center of the frame. The reddish-brown panel extends across the foreground and middle ground from the top left to the bottom right. On the left, the open driver's door frame is visible, and on the right, the side mirror is visible against a bright, white background that fills the top right and background of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, looking slightly upward. The video features a smooth, counterclockwise arc shot around the car's interior, capturing dynamic angles and details. This low-angle, hip-level shot maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground, highlighting the details of the driver's side front door. The door panel and A-pillar are upholstered in a dark, forest-green material that has a soft, suede-like texture. A small, rectangular \"AIRBAG\" label is embossed on the pink section of the door. The driver-side wing mirror, visible in the middle ground, is also colored dark green. The scene is set against a bright, overcast sky, with the word \"AIRBAG\" embossed to the left of the glove compartment surface.",

    "Scene": "A low-angle, close-up view captures the interior of a car's driver's side against a bright, overcast sky. The door panel is upholstered in a two-tone, suede-like fabric, with the upper section in dark green and a large inset panel in a reddish-brown color.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
