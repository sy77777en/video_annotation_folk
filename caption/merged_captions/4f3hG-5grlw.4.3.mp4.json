  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a tall figure stands motionless in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground within a wooded clearing. The figure, dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white shirt, has its head completely covered by a smooth, pale, featureless mask, giving it the appearance of a mannequin. The scene is framed by out-of-focus foliage in the foreground, which occupies the left and bottom portions of the screen. The environment is set within a small clearing in a dense, overgrown forest, rendered in a desaturated, almost monochromatic palette of muted greens and greys, suggesting an overcast day. The clearing has a pale ground covered in gravel or dry leaves and is surrounded by tangled trees with gnarled branches and thick undergrowth. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and slowly and smoothly zooms in on the figure standing among the trees. The shot utilizes shallow focus, with the foreground foliage appearing blurred while the distant figure remains in sharp detail. The figure remains stationary, surrounded by dense trees and undergrowth that fill the middle ground and background.",

    "Camera": "From a level, eye-level perspective, the camera slowly and smoothly zooms in on a person standing in a wooded area. The shot utilizes shallow focus, with the foreground foliage appearing blurred while the distant figure remains in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A tall figure stands in a wooded clearing, dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white shirt. The figure's head is completely covered by a smooth, pale, featureless mask, giving it the appearance of a mannequin. The figure remains stationary, positioned in the midground between dense foliage.",
    "Motion": "The figure in the suit and mask remains completely motionless in the wooded clearing.",
    "Scene": "Viewed from a fixed position through foreground foliage, the scene is set within a small clearing in a dense, overgrown forest. The environment is rendered in a desaturated, almost monochromatic palette of muted greens and greys, suggesting an overcast day. The clearing has a pale ground covered in gravel or dry leaves and is surrounded by tangled trees with gnarled branches and thick undergrowth. In the distance, a figure wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt stands among the trees.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
