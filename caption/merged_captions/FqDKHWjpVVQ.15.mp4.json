  "merged_caption": "Initially, a light brown, textured wall occupies the foreground center, with a dark firearm visible at the bottom center foreground. Overlay elements, including a blue minimap in the bottom left, a kill feed in the center-bottom, and an ammunition counter in the bottom right, are fixed in the foreground. Orange objective markers are visible in the upper frame. The camera, representing a first-person FPS game POV, begins at eye level with a level angle. It pans left and moves forward quickly. Upon reaching a wall, it pans right and continues forward, ascending stairs, which transitions the camera to a look-up angle. The view then pans upwards, revealing stairs with black railings that extend from the center foreground into the middle ground. An enemy soldier briefly appears in the middle ground, running from right to left near the stairs. The perspective continues to move upwards, simulating an ascent of these stairs, which remain central. As the player ascends the stairs, more enemy markers appear. Another person is seen running towards the back of the camera. The player reaches the top of the stairs, revealing a wider view of the area, including a large structure resembling scaffolding and more green foliage. The player continues to move forward, with the kill feed still showing enemy kills, and the environment becoming more visible, including additional structures and more distant foliage. This movement transitions to an elevated outdoor position where a large, black railing structure is prominent across the foreground center. Beyond this railing, an industrial or military-style area is visible in the middle ground and background, with distant buildings and palm trees in the background. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",

    "Camera": "The camera, representing a first-person FPS game POV, begins at eye level with a level angle. It pans left and moves forward quickly. Upon reaching a wall, it pans right and continues forward, ascending stairs, which transitions the camera to a look-up angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark firearm, held by unseen hands, is visible at the bottom of the screen. A heads-up display overlays the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower left, a kill feed in the center-bottom showing text like \"cloudedtruth [QBB-95] ViciousBambi\" and \"ENEMY KILLED 100\", and an ammunition counter in the lower right displaying \"71/101\". An enemy character, a soldier figure in dark, possibly camouflaged, combat gear and a helmet, is briefly seen running near a set of stairs. In the wider view, a large, dark, metallic, scaffolding structure is prominent against a hazy, light-colored sky, with light-brown or beige, possibly concrete, building walls and some green foliage also visible. Orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"74\" and \"20\" appear on screen, indicating points of interest or enemy locations.",
    "Motion": "The player, holding a dark firearm, turns left and moves towards a set of stairs before turning right to ascend them. The kill feed continues to display enemy kills, and the player's ammunition count remains at 71/101. As the player ascends the stairs, more enemy markers appear. Another person is seen running towards the back of the camera. The player reaches the top of the stairs, revealing a wider view of the area, including a large structure resembling scaffolding and more green foliage. The player continues to move forward, with the kill feed still showing enemy kills, and the environment becoming more visible, including additional structures and more distant foliage.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, initially shows a rough, light brown, textured wall before the view moves up a set of stairs with black railings. This ascent leads to an outdoor, elevated position overlooking an industrial or military-style area during the daytime. The environment includes distant buildings, some palm trees, and a prominent, large, dark grey structure that is part of the railing, around which smoke or dust is visible. The ground appears to be dirt or concrete. Several overlay elements are present: a minimap with blue and white icons is in the bottom left corner; a kill feed with blue and red text is in the lower central area; ammo and health indicators with white numbers are in the bottom right; and orange diamond-shaped objective markers are visible in the upper portion of the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
