  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman with long, wavy blonde hair in a form-fitting, long-sleeved dress entirely covered in silver or blue sequins, and a man in a light-colored suit jacket and dark trousers, both viewed from behind and positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. They walk away from the camera down a narrow, indoor aisle of a shop bathed in vibrant blue light, flanked by tall glass display cases filled with various items on the right and shelves and a counter stocked with merchandise on the left. As they move forward, the camera follows them in slow motion from a low, hip-level angle, maintaining a shallow depth of field and keeping the focus on the couple in the midground. The man in the suit moves ahead but is obscured by the woman, while she continues walking past a stationary man with long dark hair and a beard, briefly visible behind a counter on the left. As they proceed toward the background, a red neon sign with the word \"Tattoos,\" initially in the distant background at the top center, becomes more prominent as the subjects approach it. White string lights are draped across the ceiling, adding to the vibrant atmosphere. The camera maintains their central position and a height at their level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic movement as they walk through the neon-lit space toward a doorway marked by the red neon sign.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video features a smooth forward camera movement from a low, hip-level angle, following a man and a woman from behind. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the couple in the midground as they walk through a neon-lit space.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a woman with long, wavy blonde hair, viewed from behind as she walks through a narrow, brightly lit space. She wears a form-fitting, long-sleeved dress entirely covered in silver or blue sequins that glitter. Walking directly in front of her is a man in a light-colored suit jacket and dark trousers, also seen from the back. As they move forward, a third person, a man with long dark hair and a beard, is briefly visible behind a counter on the left.",
    "Motion": "A woman in a sequined dress and a man in a suit walk forward through a narrow, blue-lit corridor, with the camera following from behind. The man in the suit moves ahead but is obscured by the woman, while she continues walking past a stationary man standing behind a counter on the left. She then proceeds toward a doorway marked by a red neon sign.",
    "Scene": "A narrow, indoor aisle of a shop is bathed in a vibrant blue light. The space is flanked on the right by tall, glass display cases filled with various items and on the left by shelves and a counter stocked with merchandise. White string lights are draped across the ceiling, and a red neon sign with the word \"Tattoos\" is visible at the end of the aisle. A woman in a silver sequined dress and a man in a grey suit walk down the aisle, moving away from the camera.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a woman and a man from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. They walk away from the camera down a narrow aisle that extends from the foreground to the background, flanked by glass display cases on the right and shelves on the left. As they proceed toward the background, a man behind a counter briefly appears in the middle ground on the left. A neon sign, initially in the distant background at the top center, becomes more prominent as the subjects approach it. The camera follows the subjects' movement, maintaining their central position and a height at their level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
