  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot of a vast arctic landscape at night, captured in a static, time-lapse format from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. The frame is horizontally divided, with a snow-covered landscape occupying the bottom quarter and the night sky filling the top three-quarters. A snowy road extends from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground, where a few small, illuminated buildings are situated. To the right, a treeline rests on the horizon in the middle ground, while a partial dome structure is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the snowy landscape in the foreground to the stars and the rapidly moving aurora in the sky, sharp and clear. The primary motion is the dramatic, swirling dance of the green aurora borealis across the night sky, its brilliant lights swirling and pulsing dynamically across the sky, dominating the top and center of the frame in the background. The dynamic, curtain-like display of light moves across the dark, star-filled sky above a wide, snow-covered landscape. The ground, blanketed in thick white snow, is illuminated by the green glow from above. The clouds also drift slowly above the horizon. A line of dark coniferous trees stands on the horizon to the right, and a small, dome-like structure is partially visible behind a snowbank to the left. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the natural world.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a breathtaking landscape scenery shot of a polar or subarctic region at night. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the natural world. A vast, snow-covered terrain, glowing with an ethereal green hue, stretches towards a distant treeline under a dark, star-studded sky. Dominating the entire scene is a spectacular and dynamic display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant green lights swirling, waving, and pulsing across the heavens. A snowy road is prominently visible, extending from the foreground to the mid-ground, where a few small, illuminated buildings are clearly discernible, all dwarfed by the immense natural spectacle above.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video. The primary motion is the dramatic, swirling dance of the green aurora across the night sky. The clouds also drift slowly above the horizon.",
    "Scene": "At night, a vast, swirling aurora borealis dominates the sky with brilliant green light. The dynamic, curtain-like display of light moves across the dark, star-filled sky above a wide, snow-covered landscape. The ground, blanketed in thick white snow, is illuminated by the green glow from above. A snowy path leads from the foreground toward a few small, lit buildings in the distance. A line of dark coniferous trees stands on the horizon to the right, and a small, dome-like structure is partially visible behind a snowbank to the left.",

The camera remains static at a low height, angled upwards to emphasize the scale of the aurora."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
