  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle with deep focus, a small, child-like figure wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a pointed hood that obscures its face is initially positioned in the center-right middle ground on a wooden floor. The scene is set in a large, dimly lit room with a dark, hazy atmosphere. In the middle ground, several grotesquely obese, human-like figures with pale, waxy skin and distorted facial features are seated around a long dining table laden with an excessive amount of food, including a large fish head and long links of sausages. As the small figure runs continuously toward the right side of the room, a massive, bald-headed figure with a sagging face crawls into the scene from the bottom left, occupying the left foreground. In the middle ground, another large figure, a woman with her hair in a bun, is hunched over the table, appearing to eat from the large, cooked fish head. The camera smoothly trucks right to track the small character's movement across the middle ground and slightly pans to the right. As the character approaches a windowed wall featuring Japanese-style grid windows, through which more large figures can be seen in an adjacent, steamy area, the camera moves forward slightly and then pedestals upward to follow their jump onto the windowsill, causing the perspective to shift from a high angle to a more level one. A single light source from above casts a spotlight on the floor as the small character moves from the center towards the right side of the room.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a high angle with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly trucks right to track a small character in a yellow raincoat as they run across the floor. Midway through this movement, the camera also pans right. As the character approaches the window, the camera moves forward slightly and then pedestals upward to follow their jump onto the windowsill, causing the perspective to shift from a high angle to a more level one.",
    "Subject": "A small, child-like figure wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a pointed hood that obscures its face is seen in a dimly lit room. In the middle ground and background, several grotesquely obese, human-like figures with pale, waxy skin and distorted facial features are gathered around a long dining table. One of these large figures, a woman with her hair in a bun, is hunched over the table, appearing to eat from a large, cooked fish head. Another massive, bald-headed figure with a sagging face crawls on the floor in the foreground. The table is laden with an excessive amount of food, including long links of sausages and various meats.",
    "Motion": "A small figure in a yellow raincoat runs continuously toward the right side of the room. As it runs, a large, bald-headed figure crawls into the frame from the left foreground. In the middle ground, another large figure seated at a long table lunges forward over the food. The small figure continues running to the right over a wooden floor and moves toward a windowed wall.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a small figure in a yellow hooded coat runs across a wide, wooden plank floor. The scene is set in a large, dimly lit room with a dark, hazy atmosphere. In the middle ground and background, several disproportionately large, grotesque figures are seated at a long wooden table laden with various meats, including a large fish head and sausages. Another large figure lies on the floor in the foreground. The room features Japanese-style grid windows, through which more large figures can be seen in an adjacent, steamy area. A single light source from above casts a spotlight on the floor as the small character moves from the center towards the right side of the room.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
