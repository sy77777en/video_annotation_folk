  "merged_caption": "A man with a medium skin tone, dark hair, and a full dark beard and mustache is shown wearing a black hooded winter jacket with the hood pulled up over his head. Strapped to his chest is a light blue bag, and an orange strap-like decoration is visible near his right shoulder. He is framed in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center foreground of a snowy, rural landscape on an overcast day. Initially, a snow-covered road is visible on the right, stretching from the middle ground into the background, flanked by deep snowbanks and a dense forest of tall evergreen and bare deciduous trees. The camera, held at eye level, captures a deep focus view and maintains a level angle. As the man stands holding a camera and speaking, he briefly turns his head to the right before looking forward again. The camera arcs counterclockwise as he turns, revealing the forest occupying the background. When he rotates the camera clockwise, a street sign with partially visible text \"LAUTAVAARANTIE\" comes into view in the right middle ground. In the latter half of the video, the road appears to extend across the scene from right to left in the middle ground, with deep snowbanks lining the left and right sides of the frame. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, slightly arcing counterclockwise again by the end of the video.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a snowy, rural landscape on an overcast day. The scene is set beside a road flanked by deep snowbanks and a dense forest of tall evergreen and bare deciduous trees. The road surface is covered in snow, and a street sign with partially visible text \"LAUTAVAARANTIE\" appears in the right middleground during the latter half of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
