  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, an open instruction manual occupies the majority of the frame, positioned centrally in the foreground and middle ground. On the right side of the frame, a diagram labeled \"1\" is located, while a diagram labeled \"3\" is on the left side of the frame. A person's light-skinned hand, emerging from the sleeve of a white shirt, is slightly out of focus and visible in the top left-center middle ground, holding the edge of the top-left page. The manual's white pages feature numbered, technical diagrams illustrating the step-by-step assembly of a model, with small, gray, brown, and black mechanical components being connected, and some steps highlighted against a light tan background. A blurred object sits in the top left background. The camera maintains a shallow focus on the diagrams, while the hand makes a subtle movement as it holds the page. This high-angle shot is filmed with an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera, moving backward smoothly, initially focuses on the instruction manual in the foreground before performing a rack focus to the same manual in the person's hand in the midground. In a brightly lit indoor setting, the manual rests on a plain white surface. The manual's white pages display numbered, color-coded diagrams with grey, black, and tan illustrations for assembling small mechanical parts. The camera maintains an extremely shallow focus on the manual, which may affect the clarity of the manual's details, leaving the hand and the background softly blurred. A person's hand holds the corner of an instruction manual's page and slightly lifts it, preparing to turn it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
