  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a first-person perspective from the front passenger seat, maintaining a consistent point of view throughout. Initially, the focus is on a light-skinned, middle-aged man with a dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark beanie and jacket, who is centered in the frame as he sits in the driver's seat of a moving car at night, gripping the steering wheel. The camera, from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, employs a shallow depth of field. The man briefly turns his head and then grabs a black assault rifle propped up beside him, preparing it before placing it out of the frame. The perspective then shifts smoothly to a view of the car's dashboard, where the windshield wipers are active, clearing the rain from the glass. The camera uses a rack focus technique to transition focus from the driver to the road ahead. As the camera adjusts focus forward, the dashboard in the foreground becomes blurry, while the wet, two-lane road and police cars in the distance come into sharp focus. The road reflects the flashing red and blue lights of emergency vehicles, along with the bright headlights of an approaching car. The vehicle proceeds toward another vehicle in the distance with its headlights on and red and blue lights flashing. The hazy night sky serves as the backdrop, enhancing the tension of the scene. Overlaid at the bottom of the screen are green text subtitles displaying dialogue, and a white text overlay that reads \"[POLICE SIRENS WAIL]\". The man remains in the driver's seat as the camera's focus moves away from him to the view ahead, capturing the dynamics of the scene as it unfolds.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective inside a car, the camera initially focuses on the driver with a shallow depth of field. It then smoothly pans right, employing a rack focus technique to shift the focus from the driver to the road ahead. As the camera adjusts focus forward, the dashboard in the foreground becomes blurry, while the road and police cars in the distance come into sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned, middle-aged man with a dark beard and mustache is shown driving a car at night. He wears a dark beanie and a dark jacket. Initially seen in profile from the passenger's side, he looks forward while gripping the steering wheel. A black assault rifle is propped up in the car next to him. The perspective then shifts to a view from inside the vehicle, looking out the front windshield. The man's hands are visible on the steering wheel as he drives along a wet, two-lane road toward a vehicle in the distance with bright headlights and flashing red and blue lights. The man remains in the driver's seat as the camera's focus moves away from him to the view ahead.",
    "Motion": "A man sits in the driver's seat of a moving car at night, gripping the steering wheel. He briefly turns his head and then grabs a rifle propped up beside him. The view then shifts to look out the front windshield, where the car continues to drive forward on a wet road as its wipers sweep back and forth. The vehicle proceeds toward another vehicle in the distance that has its headlights on and red and blue lights flashing.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a vehicle at night, looking forward through the front windshield. It is raining, and the wet, two-lane road reflects the flashing red and blue lights of emergency vehicles in the distance, along with the bright headlights of an approaching car. The interior of the vehicle is dark, revealing a portion of the dashboard, a steering wheel, and a rifle propped up on the passenger side. Windshield wipers are active, clearing the rain from the glass. Overlaid at the bottom of the screen are green text subtitles displaying dialogue, and a white text overlay that reads \"[POLICE SIRENS WAIL]\".",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a first-person perspective from the front passenger seat, maintaining a consistent point of view throughout. Initially, the focus is on a man, the driver, who is centered in the frame. As the scene progresses, the perspective shifts to a view of the car's dashboard, where the driver is seen preparing a rifle, which is then placed out of the frame. The focus then transitions to the police cars in the middle ground, with their flashing lights illuminating the wet road ahead. The hazy night sky serves as the backdrop, enhancing the tension of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
