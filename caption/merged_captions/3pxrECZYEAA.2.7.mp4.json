  "merged_caption": "This video is presented as a wide shot, framed from a dark, purple-toned foreground room looking into a brightly lit, red-hued middle-ground bar. In the bottom-left foreground is a large potted plant, and on the right side is a purple entertainment console with a record player, above which hangs a framed picture of a blue, reclining figure with a television for a head. The central part of the frame reveals the bar scene, where a man with light skin and short blonde hair, wearing a dark brown shirt, is positioned in the center behind a wooden counter that extends across the middle ground. The bar has a yellow and brown checkered floor, and shelves stocked with various bottles and stacks of white cups are visible in front of him. The red walls are adorned with a neon \"Beer\" sign, a mounted fish, a dartboard, colorful posters, and a license plate. Initially, the man is resting his head on his hand behind the bar counter. The camera, positioned at the man's level, smoothly zooms in, approaching him and tilting up slightly to keep him centered in the frame. As the camera zooms in, the focus shifts inward, slightly cropping the foreground elements and making the central bar scene larger. The man then lifts his head, sits up, and starts drinking from a cup while remaining in his central position. The setting is vibrant, with a warm color palette dominated by reds and yellows, effectively juxtaposed with the darker, cooler colors outside. The floor's checkered pattern and the potted plant on the left side add to the scene's composition, enhancing the overall visual appeal as the video progresses.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
