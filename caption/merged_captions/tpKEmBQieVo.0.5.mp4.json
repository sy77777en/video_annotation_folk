  "merged_caption": "From a first-person point of view, the shot looks directly down from a high, rocky precipice. The subject, wearing a neon yellow wingsuit, has their exposed hands positioned in the bottom foreground, resting on the jagged cliff edge that extends into the middle ground. A vast valley stretches out in the background, filling the top half of the frame with green patches of vegetation and winding white lines of a river or road. The camera, representing the person's head, pans slightly to the right, shifting the view across the cliff edge. The hands in the foreground adjust their position on the rocks, with a bare hand briefly appearing in the bottom right. The camera is positioned at the subject's height, looking down. The person sways slightly as they maintain their balance, briefly placing a bare hand on the rock to adjust their position, then moving their left hand from the back to the front. The video is captured from a very unsteady, head-mounted camera, offering a dynamic perspective from a high mountain cliff. The camera angle shifts between a bird's-eye and a high-angle view of the valley far below, continuously alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise rolls. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion, and a deep focus with a large depth of field keeps the entire dramatic landscape sharp. The top of a dark-colored helmet is visible at the bottom of the view, adding to the immersive first-person experience. The surrounding landscape is composed of steep, rugged mountain faces under a daytime sky, enhancing the sense of height and exposure.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person point of view, a person stands at the edge of a rocky precipice. They are wearing a bright, neon yellow wingsuit. The top of a dark-colored helmet is visible at the bottom of the view. The person's hands are held out in front, and at one point, a bare hand is briefly seen as they adjust their position on the cliff edge.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person stands at the edge of a high, rocky cliff, looking down into the valley below. Their body sways slightly as they maintain their balance. They briefly place a bare hand on the rock to adjust their position then moving their left hand from the back to the front.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the edge of a high, rocky mountain peak. Bright yellow wingsuit is visible in the middle ground, positioned on the jagged, gray scree of the precipice. Far below, a vast valley stretches out, featuring green patches of vegetation and winding white lines of a river or road. The surrounding landscape is composed of steep, rugged mountain faces under a daytime sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
