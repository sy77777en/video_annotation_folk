  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a static wide shot of a paved asphalt path, marked with a yellow center line, located in the foreground and middle ground. The path curves from the bottom left towards the right side of the frame before disappearing behind trees and foliage in the foreground. It winds through a dense forest, enveloped by lush green foliage and tall, slender trees that form a thick canopy overhead. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled light and shadows across the scene. The camera, positioned at a hip-level, level angle, uses a deep focus to keep the entire wooded path sharp. It performs a slow, slightly unsteady pan from right to left, following the curve of the road. A young man with dark hair, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark shorts, and running shoes, is revealed as he runs into the frame from around the bend, emerging from behind the trees on the right side of the frame, where the path continues out of view. He jogs along the path toward the camera, moving slightly left of center in the frame. The shot remains a wide shot without transitioning to a full shot, capturing the man as he continues to run along the path.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a static shot of a paved path partially obscured by trees and leaves on the right side. A young man then runs into the frame, jogging along the path toward the camera.",
    "Scene": "A paved asphalt path, marked with a yellow center line, winds through a dense forest. The path is enveloped by lush green foliage and tall, slender trees that form a thick canopy overhead. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled light and shadows across the scene. A person is seen running along the path, emerging from behind the trees on the right side of the frame, where the path continues out of view.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a static wide shot of a paved path located in the foreground and middle ground, which curves from the bottom left towards the right side of the frame before disappearing behind trees and foliage in the foreground. The path is surrounded by dense green bushes in the middle ground and a forest of tall trees in the background. A man is then revealed entering the frame from the middle ground on the right, running along the path. As he moves slightly left of center in the frame, the shot stops, and it remains a wide shot without transitioning to a full shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
