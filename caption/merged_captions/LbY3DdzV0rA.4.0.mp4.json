  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape as the camera pans from left to right. The Grand Canyon fills the bottom half of the frame, with its rock formations extending from the foreground on the right, across the middle ground, and into the background toward the center and left. The top half of the frame is occupied by the sky, where large, billowing white and dark grey storm clouds are positioned in the middle ground. A patch of deep blue sky is visible in the top left. In the middle ground and background, curtains of rain fall from the clouds in the center and left portions of the scene. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking out over the canyon from an elevated viewpoint. This is a time-lapse video of the Grand Canyon, where clouds move rapidly across the sky. The shot is captured from an aerial level with a low angle. The camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right across the expansive landscape. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the vast canyon to the dramatic clouds, sharp and clear. The video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot overlooking the immense expanse of the Grand Canyon under a turbulent sky. Heavy, billowing white and dark grey clouds dominate the view, set against patches of deep blue. In the distance, curtains of rain fall from the storm clouds, partially obscuring the far-off canyon walls. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the sheer scale of the natural wonder and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions. The focus is on capturing the grandeur of the environment rather than a specific object within it.",

    "Motion": "This video features a dramatic, wide-angle landscape view of the Grand Canyon under a turbulent sky, with the camera panning from left to right. Large, white, and dark storm clouds dominate the frame, with shafts of rain visible in the distance, creating a moody and majestic atmosphere over the vast, layered rock formations.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures an extremely wide, panoramic view of the Grand Canyon from a high vantage point. The vast canyon features deep gorges and layered rock formations in shades of red, brown, and tan. The sky above is dramatic, filled with large, billowing white and dark grey storm clouds. Streaks of rain can be seen falling in the distance over parts of the canyon, while a patch of deep blue sky is visible through a break in the cloud cover.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
