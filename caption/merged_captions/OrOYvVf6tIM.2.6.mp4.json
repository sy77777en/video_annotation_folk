  "merged_caption": "This full shot is framed from a high angle, looking down at a large, open cardboard box positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The box, made of brown corrugated cardboard, rests on an off-white, textured surface that extends across the middle ground. Its top flaps are folded outward, revealing an interior that is a solid, non-reflective black, suggesting depth. A dark, out-of-focus shape is visible in the foreground on the far right, while a portion of a dark wooden object, possibly a piece of furniture, is in the background on the top right. The box remains stationary throughout the video. A beam of light, cast from a flashlight, initially illuminates the center of the box but is absorbed by the dark interior. The light then moves to the right before sweeping leftward across the front of the box, illuminating different parts as it travels, without moving off-screen. The light creates a bright, circular reflection on the flaps and the surface below it. This is a static shot taken from a high, eye-level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the box in the midground. Another light source from off-camera illuminates the scene, enhancing the texture of the box's surface.",

    "Subject": "The video features a large, open cardboard box with flaps spread outward, positioned centrally. The box is made of brown corrugated cardboard, and its interior appears dark, suggesting depth. A strong light from a flashlight casts onto the box's surface, emphasizing its texture. The box remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible changes or additional subjects.",
    "Motion": "The cardboard box remains stationary throughout the video. A beam of light, cast from an off-screen source, initially illuminates the center of the box but is absorbed by the dark interior. The light then moves to the right before sweeping leftward across the front of the box, illuminating different parts as it travels, without moving off-screen.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a brown cardboard box rests on an off-white, textured surface. The box is open, with its top flaps folded outward, revealing an interior that is a solid, non-reflective black. A flashlight casts a strong light onto the box, while another light source from off-camera illuminates the scene. The light from the flashlight moves over the box, creating a bright, circular reflection on the flaps and the surface below it. A dark wooden object, possibly a piece of furniture, is partially visible in the shadowed background.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot is framed from a high angle, looking down at a large, open cardboard box positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The box rests on an off-white, textured surface that extends across the middle ground. A dark, out-of-focus shape is visible in the foreground on the far right, while a portion of a dark wooden object is in the background on the top right. The box remains stationary, but a circular beam of light moves across the box, starting at the center and moving to the right, then shifting down towards the bottom center and left flaps and the surface below."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
