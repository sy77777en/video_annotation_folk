  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a light-skinned, middle-aged man with a bald head and short gray hair on the sides, positioned in the center-right foreground. He is wearing a white, short-sleeved polo shirt adorned with several logos, including a crest-like logo on the right side of his chest with text above and below it, a red and black logo with the words \"SYNDADS ATLANTIC\" on the left side of his chest, a black patch with white lettering on his left sleeve, and a small, colorful logo on his collar. The man is facing slightly to the left, against a backdrop of a large, calm body of water in the middle ground and a distant, hazy shoreline in the background. The scene is set outdoors during the day, brightly illuminated by natural daylight, with a clear, pale sky overhead. In the soft-focus background, a harbor or bay is visible, where numerous boats are scattered across the water. The camera remains mostly static at the man's eye level, with a slight unsteadiness noticeable in the shot. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus while blurring the background. The man remains largely stationary while speaking, with his mouth moving to articulate words and his head making subtle movements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
