  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, wearing a light-colored trench coat with dark buttons and a matching belt. The collar of the coat is dark, with light-colored lettering that spells \"TRENCH\" on the inside. Behind her, a very large, circular, silver, multi-panelled light reflector dominates the center background, brightly illuminated from behind, possibly a parabolic umbrella. A white-painted brick wall is visible in the background, primarily on the right side and partially on the left. Initially, the woman faces mostly forward, slightly angled to her right (frame's left), looking towards the viewer, with her hands near her collar. She then slowly rotates her entire body clockwise, turning away from the camera, until her back is mostly facing the viewer, still positioned in the center of the frame. As she turns, her back becomes fully visible, and she continues to hold her hands near her collar. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera appears to be handheld, as indicated by the slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movement. The background remains consistent throughout, featuring the large, reflective light panel and the brick wall. The scene is set indoors, likely a photo studio, with the woman initially facing the camera and gradually turning her entire body away from the viewer, rotating clockwise. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, capturing the temporal change as the woman rotates, maintaining her position in the center of the frame.",

    "Motion": "The woman, dressed in a light-colored trench coat, stands in front of a large, circular, silver light reflector. She begins by facing the camera, with her hands near her collar, and then gradually turns her entire body away from the viewer, rotating clockwise.

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, likely a photo studio, with a white-painted brick wall visible in the background. Dominating the backdrop is a very large, silver, multi-panelled, circular light reflector, possibly a parabolic umbrella, which is brightly illuminated from behind. A person wearing a light-colored trench coat with a dark collar stands in front of the reflector, initially facing slightly to the side and then turning their back more towards the camera. The collar of the trench coat has white lettering.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
