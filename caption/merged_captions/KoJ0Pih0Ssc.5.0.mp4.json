  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a level angle, capturing a long, curving line of rusted, cross-shaped tank traps, known as Czech hedgehogs, that starts in the bottom right foreground and extends all the way into the background across a sandy area. These structures are dark brown with visible bolts and a weathered texture. In the background, a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower with a small, enclosed top section is positioned on the top left, near a high concrete wall, with several gray, multi-story apartment buildings visible behind it. A wire fence runs along the right side of the frame from the middle ground to the background. The camera starts at eye level and moves down to ground level, beginning at a level angle, then tilts down to a slightly high angle, and finally tilts slightly upward to return to a level angle. The shot is very smooth, with the camera constantly moving forward and downward while panning right. It begins by tilting down to reveal the tank traps on the ground, then subtly shifts left to move alongside them. The camera pans slowly to the right, moving along the line of tank traps, keeping them in the middle ground in focus while revealing more of the line extending into the distance, parallel to the wire fence. As the camera pans, the framing of the background, consisting of the concrete wall, watchtower, and apartment buildings, changes, though the elements themselves remain static. In this final composition, the tank traps dominate the frame, leading from the bottom right foreground into the background, while a text overlay reading \"TANK TRAPS\" in white letters over a light blue background appears in the bottom center over the obstacles. A single streetlamp stands between the watchtower and the Czech hedgehogs, adding to the urban setting. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daylight, and the overall atmosphere is stark and industrial.",

    "Camera": "Starting at eye level and moving down to ground level, the camera begins at a level angle, then tilts down to a slightly high angle, and finally tilts slightly upward to return to a level angle. The shot is very smooth, with the camera constantly moving forward and downward while panning right. It begins by tilting down to reveal the tank traps on the ground, then subtly shifts left to move alongside them. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the tank traps in the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a series of rusted metal barricades, known as Czech hedgehogs, aligned parallel to a wire fence on their right across a sandy area. These structures are dark brown and have a cross-like shape, with visible bolts and a weathered texture. In the background, there is a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower with a small, enclosed top section, positioned closer to a tall, smooth concrete wall that runs parallel to the sandy area. Surrounding the area are several multi-story buildings with a modern, utilitarian design, characterized by flat roofs and numerous windows. A single streetlamp stands between the watchtower and the Czech hedgehogs, adding to the urban setting. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daylight, and the overall atmosphere is stark and industrial.",
    "Motion": "The camera pans slowly to the right, moving along a line of rusted, cross-shaped tank traps arranged on a sandy patch of ground. The movement keeps the tank traps in the middle ground in focus while revealing more of the line extending into the distance, parallel to a wire fence. As the camera pans, the framing of the background, consisting of a concrete wall, a watchtower, and apartment buildings, changes, though the elements themselves remain static.",
    "Scene": "In a bright, sunlit outdoor setting, a long, curving row of rusty, brown metal tank traps sits on a wide strip of sandy ground. To the left, a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower stands next to a high concrete wall. In the background, beyond the wall, are several gray, multi-story apartment buildings. A white chain-link fence runs parallel to the tank traps on the right. A blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"TANK TRAPS\" appears in the lower portion of the scene, positioned over the anti-tank obstacles.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from a level angle, capturing a long, curving line of tank traps that starts in the bottom right foreground and extends all the way into the background. In the background, a concrete watchtower is positioned on the top left, near a high concrete wall, with several buildings visible behind it. A wire fence runs along the right side of the frame from the middle ground to the background. The camera then pans slightly to the right and tilts down, shifting to a full shot at the level of the tank traps. In this final composition, the tank traps dominate the frame, leading from the bottom right foreground into the background, while a text overlay reading \"tank traps\" in white letters over a light blue background appears in the bottom center over the obstacles."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
