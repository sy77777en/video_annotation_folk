  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a man is positioned in the middle ground of a large, dimly lit, monochromatic hall. Initially, he is on the left side of the room, with a reception desk to his left and a coat rack to his right. A grand staircase occupies the center background, with chandeliers hanging from the top of the frame. The man, dressed in a white shirt with black pants, has a medium build and short hair. He starts walking from the left side of the frame toward the center and then to the right, remaining in the middle ground. The checkered floor is marked with red, footprint-like splotches, primarily concentrated in the center, with some extending into the background towards the stairs. Illumination comes from several ornate chandeliers with lit candles hanging from the high ceiling, as well as two circular wall lamps positioned on either side of the archway in front of the staircase. A moving light source follows the man, creating a relatively illuminated area around him. The camera slowly and smoothly trucks from left to right, following the character as he walks through the dark lobby. Red dots on the ground suggest the presence of blood. A text overlay remains fixed in the bottom right corner of the frame, displaying white text that changes from \"The elevator is out of order\" to \"The phone is ringing,\" which is then followed by a telephone icon. The setting includes a vintage atmosphere, enhanced by the presence of several chandeliers and the overall monochromatic black-and-white color scheme.",

    "Motion": "The scene is set in a dimly lit, monochromatic interior with a man starting from the left side of the frame, walking towards the center. The man continues to walk across the room, passing by a reception desk and a coat rack. The background includes several chandeliers, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Red dots on the ground suggest the presence of blood.

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a large, dimly lit hall with a monochromatic black-and-white color scheme. The space features a checkered floor, a large reception desk on the left, and a grand staircase in the background. Illumination comes from several ornate chandeliers with lit candles hanging from the high ceiling, as well as two circular wall lamps positioned on either side of the archway in front of the staircase. The checkered floor is marked with red, footprint-like splotches and faint white geometric outlines. A figure dressed in black and white walks across the room, followed by a moving light source that creates a relatively illuminated area around him. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays white text that changes from \"The elevator is out of order\" to \"The phone is ringing,\" which is then followed by a telephone icon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
