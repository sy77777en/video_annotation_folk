  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a group of elephants in the middle ground, positioned across the bottom half of the frame from the center-left to the right. The elephants, varying in size, are dark gray and appear to be grazing. They are moving slowly as a group from right to left across the scene, maintaining a steady pace in a single file with the largest elephant at the front and a similarly sized elephant at the back, while the smallest elephant is in the middle. The bottom half of the frame is filled with golden savanna grass that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a hazy, distant landscape with a few scattered acacia trees sits on the horizon, while the top half of the frame is occupied by a pale blue sky. The setting is open and expansive, suggesting a natural habitat. The time of day appears to be midday, with bright, even lighting illuminating the scene. The camera is static and positioned at the same height as the subjects, capturing them from a distance with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing elephants in a grassland setting. The expansive grassland stretches into the distance, characterized by tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with the elephants' presence adding a sense of life and movement to the tranquil landscape. The elephants are the primary subjects, and their presence is consistent throughout the video, their dark silhouettes contrasting against the lighter grasses. The background remains consistent, with no other significant objects or changes in the environment.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing elephants in a grassland setting.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of elephants in a grassy savanna. The elephants, varying in size, are dark gray and appear to be grazing. They are walking from right to left across the scene, with the elephant at the very back appearing to be of similar size to the one at the front, while the elephant in the middle seems smaller. The setting is open and expansive, suggesting a natural habitat. The elephants are the primary subjects, and their presence is consistent throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "In a vast, open grassland with a clear sky, a group of five elephants, including adults and calves, is seen walking in a line from right to left. The elephants maintain a steady pace, moving in a single file with the largest elephant at the front and a similarly sized elephant at the back, while the smallest elephant is in the middle. The background remains consistent, with no other significant objects or changes in the environment.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a vast savanna landscape under a clear sky. The time of day appears to be midday, with bright, even lighting illuminating the scene. The expansive grassland stretches into the distance, characterized by tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. Scattered acacia trees dot the horizon, adding to the open, natural environment. A group of elephants is present, grazing and moving slowly across the terrain, their dark silhouettes contrasting against the lighter grasses. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with the elephants' presence adding a sense of life and movement to the tranquil landscape.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot captures a group of elephants in the middle ground, positioned across the bottom half of the frame from the center-left to the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
