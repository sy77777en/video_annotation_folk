  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a woman wearing a brown helmet, a blue tank top, and dark pants rides a brown horse with a dark mane and tail, white wraps on its front legs, and a saddle over a pink saddle pad in a dirt arena. Positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, they make a tight left turn around a blue barrel, kicking up reddish-brown dirt into a cloud. As they complete the turn and move toward the left side of the frame, a dark-colored dog with white markings on its chest and legs enters from the center left, briefly running alongside them in the middle ground. The horse and rider then continue to gallop across the arena from the right to the left side of the frame, mostly staying in the center. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, smoothly pans left to track their movement, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The dirt arena occupies the foreground and middle ground, enclosed by a metal fence, with a line of green trees standing in the background under a clear sky. The dog runs toward the left and enters the frame from the left as the camera pans left, briefly following alongside the horse.",

    "Camera": "From a level, eye-level perspective, the camera smoothly pans left to track a person riding a horse in a dirt arena. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A woman wearing a brown helmet, a blue tank top, and dark pants rides a brown horse in a dirt arena. The horse has a dark mane and tail, white wraps on its front legs, and is fitted with a saddle over a pink saddle pad. As they straighten out after the horse makes a tight turn around a blue barrel, a dark-colored dog with white markings on its chest and legs runs into the scene and briefly follows them.",
    "Motion": "A woman on a brown horse completes a tight left turn around a blue barrel in a dirt arena, kicking up dust. As they straighten out, a dog runs into the frame from the left and briefly follows alongside the horse. The horse and rider then continue to gallop across the arena toward the left side of the frame. A dog runs toward the left and enters the frame from the left as the camera pans left, briefly following alongside the horse.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor dirt arena on a sunny day, a person rides a brown horse around a blue barrel. The ground is composed of reddish-brown dirt, which is kicked up into a cloud as the horse moves. The arena is enclosed by a metal fence, and a line of green trees stands in the background under a clear sky. A small, dark dog with a white chest and legs briefly runs alongside the horse.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a woman on a horse is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, turning around a blue barrel. As they complete the turn, they move toward the left side of the frame, and a dog enters from the center left, running alongside them in the middle ground. The horse and rider then travel from the right to the left side of the frame, mostly staying in the center, while the camera pans to follow their movement.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
