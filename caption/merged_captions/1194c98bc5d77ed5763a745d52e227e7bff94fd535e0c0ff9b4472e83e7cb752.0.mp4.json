  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot filmed from above, a mixture of whole spices is scattered across a dark pan, extending from the foreground to the background. A light brown wooden spatula with several long, parallel slots is positioned in the foreground, starting at the top left of the frame. The spatula moves from left to right across the pan, pushing and tumbling the spices, which include small, light green, oval-shaped fennel seeds, dark brown pieces of broken star anise, thin shards of brown cinnamon or cassia bark, and small, reddish-purple peppercorns. The spices are continuously stirred and mixed together by the spatula's movement, changing their arrangement within the pan. This is a static, high-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the spices being stirred. The spatula moves randomly, gently tossing the spices across the pan's surface, creating a dynamic interaction between the wooden tool and the colorful spice blend.",

    "Scene": "From a close, overhead perspective, a mixture of whole spices is stirred in a dark pan. The blend consists of light green, oval-shaped fennel seeds, dark reddish peppercorns, and brown, woody shards of bark and star anise. A light-colored wooden spatula with horizontal slots moves through the frame, gently tossing the spices across the pan's surface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
