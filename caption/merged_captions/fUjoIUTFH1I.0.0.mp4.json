  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a cityscape, focusing on the urban landscape rather than a specific subject. In the foreground, a rectangular green park with circular pathways occupies the bottom center of the frame. Positioned in the middle ground, directly above the park, a large white cathedral stands at the center, flanked by two matching buildings. From this central point, a dense grid of streets and low-rise buildings extends across the middle ground. The urban landscape continues into the background, where the city fades into a hazy sky, with taller buildings visible in the distant background. The scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down on the city. The camera slowly moves forward and descends toward a central park and a prominent white cathedral, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire cityscape sharp. This high-angle, aerial scenery shot overlooks the French Quarter in New Orleans, with the St. Louis Cathedral and Jackson Square positioned in the bottom center of the frame. The video captures the scene on a foggy, overcast day, emphasizing the vastness of the urban landscape and the moody, atmospheric conditions. The green and brown lawn of Jackson Square features circular pathways, centered on the white St. Louis Cathedral, a large church with three dark spires, flanked by two matching historic buildings. Radiating from the square, the dense grid of the French Quarter's low-rise buildings with dark roofs stretches into the distance, where the modern city skyline is partially obscured by the haze. The video lacks a main subject, as the camera's high and wide perspective emphasizes the grand scale and architectural character of the location itself.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, slow aerial shot from a high angle, looking down on a city. The camera slowly moves forward and descends toward a central park and a prominent white cathedral. A deep focus keeps the entire cityscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape, capturing a dense urban environment under a hazy, overcast sky. In the foreground, a rectangular green park with concentric circular paths is symmetrically framed by rows of buildings. At the head of the park stands a large, white, multi-spired cathedral, which acts as a central architectural feature. From this point, a grid of streets lined with historic-looking buildings with dark roofs extends far into the foggy distance, blending with more modern high-rises on the horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as the camera's high and wide perspective emphasizes the vastness of the urban landscape and the moody, atmospheric conditions rather than singling out a specific entity. The focus is on the grand scale and architectural character of the location itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
