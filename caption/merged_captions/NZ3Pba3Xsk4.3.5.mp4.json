  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot begins as a wide shot, capturing an informational sign in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The video starts with a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot at a level angle, with the zoo enclosure in deep focus. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle close-up shot that centers on the informational sign for the Indian Rhinoceros (*Rhinoceros unicornis*). The sign, set in a light gray frame against a low concrete wall, features text in Japanese and English, a small map of India, and a photo of the animal. As the camera tilts down, the focus becomes shallow, bringing the board in the foreground into sharp focus while blurring the background. In the middle ground, a low concrete wall separates the viewer from a dirt enclosure containing blue-gray posts on the left and a pile of rocks on the right. The background consists of trees and a building with a pale, textured facade visible beyond the enclosure. In this final framing, the sign occupies the majority of the screen in the foreground, with only small portions of the grass in front and the concrete wall behind it visible at the bottom and top edges of the frame, respectively. The video focuses on the descriptive sign, presenting the static, informational context of the zoo environment rather than any specific animal or action within the enclosure.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, eye-level shot begins at a level angle with the zoo enclosure in deep focus. The camera then tilts down, shifting to a high angle to frame an informational board. As it moves, the focus becomes shallow, bringing the board in the foreground into sharp focus while blurring the background.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a scenery shot of an informational sign at a zoo, positioned in front of an animal enclosure. The camera tilts downward, adjusting to a high angle to properly frame the light-colored sign, which provides details about the \"Indian Rhinoceros\" (Rhinoceros unicornis) in multiple languages, complete with a habitat map and a photograph of the animal. Behind the sign, the enclosure features a dirt ground, a low concrete wall, a series of thick blue-gray posts, and a large pile of dark rocks, all surrounded by patches of green grass and trees. The video focuses on the descriptive sign, presenting the static, informational context of the zoo environment rather than any specific animal or action within the enclosure.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with the camera at a level angle and then tilts downward, transitioning to a high angle to frame an informational sign for an Indian Rhinoceros at a zoo. The sign is in multiple languages, including Japanese and English, and is placed in front of the animal's enclosure.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene at what appears to be a zoo focuses on an informational sign for the Indian Rhinoceros (*Rhinoceros unicornis*). The sign, set in a light gray frame against a low concrete wall, features text in Japanese and English, a small map of India, and a photo of the animal. The camera tilts down to focus on the sign. In the middle ground, a dirt enclosure contains large rocks, patches of green grass, and a row of blue posts. In the background, trees and a building with a pale, textured facade are visible beyond the enclosure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
