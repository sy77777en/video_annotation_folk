  "merged_caption": "This video is a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape, captured from a high-angle aerial perspective at sunrise. The scene is framed with the sun in the top left background, casting a golden light across the landscape. A dense layer of fog occupies the foreground and middle ground, covering the lower portion of the frame. A prominent monastery with a distinctive domed roof emerges from the fog in the center of the composition, positioned in the middle ground. To the right, other city buildings and distant hills are visible in the middle ground and background, respectively, situated above the fog under a clear sky. The camera moves slowly and very subtly forward over the city shrouded in fog, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape, from the clouds in the foreground to the distant hills, sharp. As the camera glides forward, it offers a majestic, sweeping view over the cloud-filled landscape. The clouds gradually drift towards and to the right of the camera, enhancing the dreamlike sea of clouds from which buildings emerge. The prominent domed building on a hill rises above the clouds, illuminated by the golden light of the rising sun, which glows brightly on the horizon. The sun's low position casts a golden light across the top of the cloud cover, adding depth to the serene and breathtaking view. The video, filmed by a drone, provides an ethereal cityscape scenery shot, emphasizing the grand scale of the scene. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the majestic and atmospheric environment, with parts of the surrounding city and distant hills visible through and above the thick fog, creating a dreamlike and atmospheric environment.",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial perspective, the camera moves slowly and very subtly forward over a city shrouded in fog at sunrise. A deep focus keeps the entire landscape, from the clouds in the foreground to the distant hills, sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an ethereal cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high aerial vantage point at sunrise. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the majestic and atmospheric environment, emphasizing the grand scale of the scene. A dense layer of low-lying white fog blankets the urban landscape, creating a dreamlike sea of clouds from which buildings emerge. A prominent white monastery with a distinctive domed roof is bathed in the warm, golden light of the rising sun, which glows brightly on the horizon. Parts of the surrounding city and distant hills are visible through and above the thick fog, adding depth to the serene and breathtaking view.",
    "Motion": "This is a breathtaking aerial scenery shot of a city at sunrise, partially obscured by a thick blanket of fog. The camera subtly glides forward, offering a majestic, sweeping view over the cloud-filled landscape. The clouds gradually drift towards and to the right of the camera. A prominent domed building on a hill rises above the clouds, illuminated by the golden light.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a city at sunrise, partially enveloped in a thick layer of white fog. The sun, low on the horizon, casts a golden light across the top of the cloud cover. Emerging from the fog on a hillside is a prominent white building topped with a dark, circular dome. Portions of the city, including other buildings and distant hills, are visible above the dense fog under a clear sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
