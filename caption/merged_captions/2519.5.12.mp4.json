  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young boy with short, dark hair and light skin, standing in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. He is wearing a white polo shirt with dark horizontal stripes, blue jeans, and a dark belt with a silver buckle. The boy is looking slightly upward and holds his hands up in front of his chest as if gesturing. In the foreground, the out-of-focus silhouette of a person's arm, clad in a dark garment, occupies the far left edge of the frame. The scene is set inside a room with plain, beige-colored walls, illuminated by warm, soft light. A wooden desk is visible in the background on the left, cluttered with papers, a red item that could be a folder or a book, and a black desk lamp. Several small notes are pinned to the wall above the desk. The camera, from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, moves forward with a generally smooth motion, though there is a very slight shake, employing a shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the boy in the midground. As the video progresses, the person in the dark garment moves from the left side of the frame to the right, their back progressively obscuring the boy. By the end of the shot, the foreground person's back and arm dominate the frame, completely blocking the boy from view.",

    "Subject": "A young boy with short, dark hair and light skin stands in a room, looking slightly upward. He is wearing a white polo shirt with dark horizontal stripes, blue jeans, and a dark belt with a silver buckle. His hands are held up in front of his chest as if he is gesturing. The scene is viewed from behind a person in a dark garment, whose arm and part of the body are initially visible on the left. This person then moves to the right, their dark-clad back gradually obscuring the boy from view.",
    "Motion": "A person in a dark garment, seen from behind, moves from the left side of the frame to the right, their back progressively obscuring a young boy who is standing still and looking slightly upward. The boy holds his hands up in front of his chest in a gesturing motion.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a room with plain, beige-colored walls, illuminated by warm, soft light. In the background, a wooden desk sits in a corner, cluttered with papers, a red item that could be a folder or a book, and a black desk lamp. Several small notes are pinned to the wall above the desk. A young boy in a striped polo shirt and jeans stands in the middle of the room. The view is partially obscured by a dark, out-of-focus silhouette on the left, which moves to block the boy from sight.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young boy standing in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, the out-of-focus silhouette of a person's arm occupies the far left edge of the frame. A desk is visible in the background on the left. The person in the foreground then moves to the right, their dark back progressively crossing the frame and obscuring the boy. By the end of the shot, the foreground person's back and arm dominate the frame, completely blocking the boy from view. The camera slowly moves forward with a slight shake, positioned at the subject's level throughout the action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
