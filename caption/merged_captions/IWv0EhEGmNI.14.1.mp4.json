  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the hands and weapon of the main subject visible at the bottom center and foreground of the frame. Two armed individuals dressed in full military gear, including camouflage uniforms, tactical vests, helmets, and backpacks, are navigating a dimly lit, narrow hallway of a house or building with wooden floors and walls. Another individual in military gear is positioned ahead, occupying the center to right side of the frame and situated in the middle ground, moving away from the camera down the hallway. The hallway itself extends from the foreground to the background, with walls and portraits visible along the left and right edges. A window at the end of the corridor reveals the chaotic fire scene outside. The camera starts at a high angle, positioned above the waist, and transitions to a level angle before returning to a high angle, maintaining a dynamic perspective with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. As the explosion occurs outside the window, the individual in front jumps left over the wooden stair railing, diving toward the lower floor, while debris, flames, and smoke rapidly fill the entire field of view, moving from the background and middle ground into the foreground and center. The perspective becomes disoriented as the blast pushes the camera backward, causing it to tilt upward and drop down, and broken boards, dust, and fire dominate the frame, obscuring clear spatial relationships. The camera then pans from right to left, suggesting the player is trying to stand up while leaning on one arm. Throughout, the camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A faint white reticle remains fixed at the center of the display, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space, until it disappears after the explosion.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at a high angle, positioned above the waist, and transitions to a level angle before returning to a high angle. It maintains a dynamic perspective with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. Utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field, all elements remain sharp. Representing the player's perspective, the camera initially moves forward as the player attempts to walk behind a soldier. An explosion ahead throws the player backward, causing the camera to tilt upward and drop down. The camera then pans from right to left, suggesting the player is trying to stand up while leaning on one arm. Throughout, the camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two armed individuals dressed in full military gear, including camouflage uniforms, tactical vests, helmets, and backpacks. One person, whose hands and weapon are visible in the foreground, holds a black firearm and appears to be following the other, who is walking ahead and facing away. Both individuals are equipped with gloves and other standard combat accessories. Suddenly, the player in front jumps to the left and flies downstairs as an explosion occurs outside the window. In an instant, broken wooden boards, debris, flames, and smoke fill the field of vision, and the player is blown backwards, creating a tense, action-oriented environment involving military personnel navigating a hazardous area with significant destruction.",
    "Motion": "Two individuals are descending the stairs. An explosion occurs outside the window, prompting the person in front to leap to the left over the wooden stair railing, diving toward the lower floor. Meanwhile, the person behind, seen from a first-person perspective, is blown backward by the blast and hits the ground. Debris, flames, and smoke fill the area as the chaos unfolds.",
    "Scene": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, and takes place indoors within a dimly lit, narrow hallway of a house or building. The environment features wooden floors and walls, with portraits of the characters hanging on the wall. A figure in military gear, wearing camouflage and carrying equipment, moves ahead in the hallway, their placement reinforcing the sense of urgency. Suddenly, an explosion occurs, causing flames to shoot up into the sky, with orange-red blast waves and debris flying everywhere. Dust fills the air, and the characters are swept away by the impact, resulting in a disoriented perspective. The outline of the characters' hands can be seen at the bottom of the screen. At the moment of the explosion, the screen is superimposed with dust and blood, enhancing the chaotic atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by dark browns, yellows, and the orange glow of fire. Overlay elements are present, including a faint white reticle or crosshair at the center of the view, which is not part of the physical scene but appears as a visual aid on the display.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the hands and weapon of the main subject visible at the bottom center and foreground of the frame. Another individual in military gear is positioned ahead, occupying the center to right side of the frame and situated in the middle ground, moving away from the camera down a narrow hallway. The hallway itself extends from the foreground to the background, with walls and portraits visible along the left and right edges. A window at the end of the corridor reveals the chaotic fire scene outside. The camera is at the same height as the main subject’s eyes, level with the standing figures. As the explosion occurs, the individual in front jumps left and descends out of the frame, while debris, flames, and smoke rapidly fill the entire field of view, moving from the background and middle ground into the foreground and center. The perspective becomes disoriented as the blast pushes the camera backward, and broken boards, dust, and fire dominate the frame, obscuring clear spatial relationships. Throughout the scene, a faint white reticle remains fixed at the center of the display, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space, until it disappears after the explosion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
