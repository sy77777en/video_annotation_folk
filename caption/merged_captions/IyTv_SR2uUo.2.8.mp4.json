  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young, light-skinned woman with dark brown hair tied back, centered in the foreground, wearing a bright yellow helmet with \"GoPro BE A HERO.\" and \"KORDA'S\" written on it, a pink top, and a green and black safety harness over her clothes. The camera, attached to her helmet, is positioned at her level against a background of a vast, hilly landscape. Her facial expression shifts from a wide, teeth-baring smile to an open-mouthed look of surprise or a scream as she claps her hands together multiple times. The shot rapidly transitions as she turns her body and looks upward, becoming a full shot that keeps her centered in the foreground. Concurrently, the camera's position changes to be above her, capturing a high-angle view of her entire body as the ground far below fills the background. The camera moves smoothly in harmony with her head movements, with minimal shaking, initially panning to the left as she turns her body, then tilting downward while rolling counterclockwise as she looks upward. Although there is a downward tilt, the final angle remains a high angle rather than a bird's-eye view. This movement is accompanied by a varying Dutch angle as the camera rolls. The locked-on POV shot, captured from the helmet-mounted camera, shows her in mid-air over a vast, sunlit valley during the day, offering a dynamic view of the expansive, hilly terrain covered in green and brown scrub with rocky outcrops. In the distance, a small cluster of buildings and a winding body of water are visible under a clear blue sky. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, and exhibits mild barrel distortion.",

    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned woman with dark brown hair tied back is shown from a high-angle, locked-on perspective. She is wearing a bright yellow helmet with \"GoPro BE A HERO.\" and \"KORDA'S\" written on it, a pink top, and a green and black safety harness over her clothes. Her facial expression shifts from a wide, teeth-baring smile to an open-mouthed look of surprise or a scream as she is suspended in the air, clapping her hands a few times.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on perspective, a woman suspended in a harness remains midair. Her expression shifts from a smile to an open-mouthed look of surprise, and she claps her hands together multiple times.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, captured from a helmet-mounted camera, shows a person in mid-air over a vast, sunlit valley during the day. The camera, mounted on the woman's helmet, moves in sync with her head movements. It first pans left as she turns her body, then tilts down while rolling counterclockwise as she looks upward, offering a dynamic view of the expansive, hilly terrain covered in green and brown scrub with rocky outcrops. In the distance, a small cluster of buildings and a winding body of water are visible under a clear blue sky. The person wears a bright yellow helmet with black and white text overlays reading \"GoPro\" and \"BE A HERO\" in white against a black background, and \"KORDA'S\" in black with the apostrophe in red, and is secured in a harness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
