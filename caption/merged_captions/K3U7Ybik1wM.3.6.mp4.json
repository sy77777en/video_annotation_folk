  "merged_caption": "This is a static, wide scenery shot of an attic bedroom, captured from a level angle, providing an eye-level perspective. The sloped ceiling with a dark wooden beam occupies the top left of the frame, leading the eye toward a central skylight in the upper background, revealing a glimpse of green foliage against a bright sky. In the left background, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. A wall of white closets is positioned in the center background. In the right middle ground, a small wooden desk and a matching chair with a green and yellow patterned cushion sit against the wall, next to a white radiator. The scene is framed on the far right by a dark door in the foreground, which enhances the sense of depth, extending from the shadowed foreground to the more distant, illuminated elements of the room. The room features light beige-colored carpeting and white walls, contributing to its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The entire video is modified with a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, which diminishes the clarity of the camera's focus. The room is dimly lit, with a warm glow emanating from the left side, while the right side, including the dark wooden door, remains in shadow. The static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space, lacking a main subject.",

    "Subject": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom, characterized by its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The video lacks a main subject, as the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space. The room features a sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams and a large, central skylight that provides the main source of natural light, revealing a glimpse of green foliage outside. To the left, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. In the background, a wall of simple white closet doors stands opposite a small wooden desk and chair in the right midground, creating a sense of a quiet, lived-in space.",
    "Motion": "This is a static scenery shot of a cozy attic bedroom. The room features a sloped ceiling with exposed wooden beams and a large skylight. A bed is visible on the left, while a small wooden desk and chair are on the right.",
    "Scene": "A wide shot captures an attic bedroom with a sloped, white ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. In the center of the ceiling, a large skylight reveals a glimpse of green foliage against a bright sky. The room has light beige-colored carpeting and white walls. On the left, a bed with a black metal headboard and a small nightstand are slightly blurred. Against the back wall stand tall, white closet doors with simple wooden knobs. To the right, a small wooden desk and a matching chair with a green and yellow patterned cushion are positioned against the wall, next to a white radiator. The room is dimly lit, with a warm glow emanating from the left side, while the right side, including a dark wooden door, remains in shadow.",

The sloped ceiling with a dark wooden beam occupies the top left of the frame, leading the eye toward a central skylight in the upper background. In the left background, a bed is partially visible. A wall of white closets is positioned in the center background. In the right middle ground, a wooden desk sits against the wall, with a chair placed in front of it. The scene is framed on the far right by a dark door in the foreground, which enhances the sense of depth, extending from the shadowed foreground to the more distant, illuminated elements of the room."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
