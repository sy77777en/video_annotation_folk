  "merged_caption": "This medium shot captures four young men inside a brightly lit, modern indoor facility, possibly a sports arena or training center. The background consists of a large, white, grid-like ceiling structure that occupies the top portion of the scene, allowing ample light into the space. A young man with spiky orange hair, wearing a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"50\" over a black long-sleeved undershirt with blue stripes on the arms, is positioned in the center of the frame, pushing forward with an intense expression. On the right side of the frame, a young man with short, spiky black hair, wearing a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" over a matching black and blue undershirt, is being pushed back, actively using his arm to block the shove. In the bottom-left corner, a young man with shaggy black hair and blue eyes, dressed in a white jersey, stumbles forward towards the lower left corner of the frame with an open-mouthed expression. A fourth young man with medium-length purple hair, wearing a red jersey, stands on the left side of the frame, slightly behind the central figure, maintaining a focused gaze to the right and moving towards the left-center of the frame. The camera is quite unsteady, with motion that lacks a clear pattern, capturing the dynamic confrontation among the characters.",

    "Subject": "Four young men, drawn in an anime style, are engaged in a physical confrontation. The central figure, a young man with spiky orange hair, grits his teeth with an intense expression. He wears a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"50\" over a black long-sleeved undershirt with blue stripes on the arms and is pushing forward. To his right, a young man with short, spiky black hair and a strained, wide-eyed expression is being pushed back. He wears a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" over a matching black and blue undershirt. Prominently positioned at the front on the left side of the frame, a young man with shaggy black hair and blue eyes, dressed in a white jersey, faces forward with an open-mouthed expression. Initially located at the far left of the frame, a young man with medium-length purple hair, wearing a red jersey, moves to the left-center as the scene progresses, maintaining a focused gaze to the right.",
    "Motion": "An anime character with orange hair forcefully shoves a character with black hair, who actively uses his arm to block the shove. In the foreground, another character with black hair stumbles forward towards the lower left corner of the frame, while a fourth character with purple hair is positioned in the middle ground, slightly turning to his left and moving towards the left-center of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a brightly lit, modern indoor facility, possibly a sports arena or training center. The background is dominated by a large, white, grid-like structure that forms the ceiling and upper walls, allowing ample light into the space. On what appears to be a court, four male anime characters are captured in a dynamic pose. They are dressed in athletic uniforms, consisting of either red and black or white and black jerseys over black long-sleeved shirts accented with blue lines.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
