  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from above, capturing two humanoid figures at a rectangular wooden table. The seated figure, with white hair, clad in a black suit and white gloves, is positioned towards the bottom center-right of the frame with both hands on a world map, while the standing figure in a green uniform is partially visible on the right. The camera starts at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, and moves downward to an eye-level position slightly above the head, maintaining a high angle looking down. The camera employs deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. It moves smoothly downward, approaching the person seated at the table while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise. The seated figure remains stationary, with both hands resting on the world map, and does not exhibit any discernible movement throughout the video. The focus shifts to the map, keeping it fully visible, while only parts of the figures remain in the lower-right corner. The map and a photograph depicting a glowing object underwater are central in the frame, with the photograph near the seated figure's right hand. A black landline telephone is at the top left of the table. The seated figure's chair with a red backrest is visible, and two empty chairs with white seats are on either side. The camera maintains an overhead perspective throughout, emphasizing the map and table elements, with the blue floor serving as the background. Overlay text \"[3];Historicpictoric.com\" is located in the lower left corner of the frame.",

    "Subject": "A humanoid figure with white hair, clad in a black suit and white gloves, is seated at a rectangular wooden table, viewed from directly above. This figure has both hands placed on a world map spread across the table. On top of the map, near the figure's right hand, lies a dark photograph depicting what appears to be an underwater scene with a glowing, elongated object. At the top left corner of the table, a black landline telephone rests. Another humanoid figure, dressed in a green uniform, stands partially visible to the right of the seated figure. The seated figure appears to be examining the map and the photograph. Two empty chairs with white seats are positioned on either side of the table, while the seated figure occupies a chair with a red cushioned backrest.",
    "Motion": "The humanoid figure remains seated at the table, with both hands resting on the world map, and does not exhibit any discernible movement throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The scene is an indoor setting, viewed from an overhead perspective, focusing on a polished wooden table with a blue carpeted floor. On the table, a world map is spread out, and a photograph depicting a glowing object underwater is placed on the top right corner of the map. At the top left of the map, a black landline telephone sits. A figure with white hair, wearing a black suit and white gloves, is seated at the table, with their hands resting on the map and the photograph. Two chairs with white seats and wooden armrests are visible on either side of the figure. Overlay text \"[3];Historicpictoric.com\" is located in the lower left corner of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from above, capturing two humanoid figures at a rectangular wooden table. The seated figure, in a black suit, is positioned towards the bottom center-right of the frame with both hands on a world map, while the standing figure in a green uniform is partially visible on the right. The camera is positioned above, initially showing their full bodies. As the camera moves downward, the focus shifts to the map, keeping it fully visible, while only parts of the figures remain in the lower-right corner. The map and a photograph on it are central in the frame, with a black landline telephone at the top left of the table.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
