  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a child wearing a colorful, patterned outfit and a bright red hat, positioned slightly to the right of the center in the foreground. The child, who has light skin and medium-length hair, is actively moving on a bed, which extends from the foreground to the background at the bottom of the frame. Light-colored pillows and bedding are visible, along with the dark frame structure of the headboard located in the lower left side of the frame. The child's colorful outfit and red hat stand out prominently. The room is an indoor setting, likely a bedroom, with a cozy and personalized atmosphere. The walls are adorned with colorful, abstract artwork and decorative elements, including a series of small, dark plane-shaped decorations. A window with blinds is visible in the upper right corner, allowing natural light to enter, suggesting daytime. A lit table lamp is positioned in the bottom left corner, adding to the room's ambiance. Initially, the child supports themselves with their left hand. The camera is positioned at ground level with a low angle, looking up, using deep focus with a large depth of field. As the child rolls over towards their left side, ending up in a kneeling position with both hands on the bed, the camera smoothly pans right to follow their movement. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot due to the child's movement, capturing most of the child's body except for the feet. The child continues to move dynamically, shifting further to the right side of the frame. Throughout the video, the camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective relative to the child's height. Despite the dynamic motion, the child's expression suggests they might be crying, making them the main focus with their actions and attire drawing attention.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
