  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young man with a light skin tone and long, wavy, shoulder-length hair, which is a light brown or dark blonde color, is seated in the center-left of the frame, occupying the foreground. He is wearing a school uniform that includes a dark navy blazer with a crest on the left breast pocket, a white collared shirt, and a dark, patterned tie. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor room with cool-toned lighting, and the overall color palette is muted, consisting of dark blues and greys. In the background, a plain wall with a white baseboard is visible. To the left, the blue light from a laptop screen casts a glow, and to the right, the leg of a tripod stands on the floor. The young man remains stationary, sitting with his head turned fully to his right, smiling as he looks at something else. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and is slightly unsteady, capturing the shot from a high, eye-level angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the young man in the foreground in focus.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
