  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot looking directly up at an ornate dome. The dome, with its central green stained-glass skylight, occupies the center of the frame. A large chandelier hangs from the dome's center, positioned in the middle ground and initially visible in the lower half of the frame. The surrounding decorative ceiling and a ring of lights fill the rest of the composition, with the tops of arches visible at the bottom edge. From a low angle, the camera smoothly dollies forward while tilting up to reveal an ornate, domed ceiling. The camera moves forward while tilting upward, capturing an ornate, domed ceiling. The dome features a large, green stained-glass section at its center, surrounded by intricate carvings and a ring of lights. A large, elaborate chandelier hangs from the apex of the dome. The camera performs a slow, subtle upward tilt, allowing more of the dome to come into view and further emphasizing its scale and intricate details while the elements below, like the chandelier, move toward the bottom edge. The dome consists of numerous greenish-blue stained glass panels arranged in a grid pattern within a dark framework, converging towards a central circular design. The surrounding ceiling area is cream-colored and features elaborate, detailed carvings. Small, warm lights are embedded around the base of the dome, above an inscribed band. A multi-tiered, ornate chandelier hangs from the dome's center. Below, architectural features like arches are partially visible. The scene is illuminated by artificial lighting. A deep focus keeps the entire intricate structure, including the central stained-glass skylight, in sharp view.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, looking up at the interior of a grand building's ornate dome. The dome features a large, circular stained-glass skylight with a grid pattern and a greenish tint, illuminated from above or within, and is surrounded by intricate, decorative plasterwork and a ring of small lights. A large, multi-tiered chandelier hangs down from the center below the skylight. There is no main subject because the focus is intentionally broad, capturing the overall grandeur, intricate details, and atmosphere of the architectural space itself, emphasizing the environment and scale rather than a specific person or object within it.",

    "Scene": "An upward view captures the ornate interior ceiling of a building, dominated by a large dome. This dome consists of numerous greenish-blue stained glass panels arranged in a grid pattern within a dark framework, converging towards a central circular design.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
