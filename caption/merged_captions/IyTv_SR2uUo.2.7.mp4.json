  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a man with a light complexion surfing inside the barrel of a large ocean wave during the daytime. He is wearing a black, short-sleeved wetsuit and black shorts, crouching in the center foreground on an orange and red surfboard with a yellow nose, visible at the bottom of the frame. The camera, positioned on the surfboard, captures the view from inside the hollow, turquoise-green tube of the wave, with the bright sun visible through the thin, translucent ceiling, creating a bright white glow. The lip of the wave is a churning mass of white foam, and water droplets spray through the air. As the surfer transitions to a kneeling position and then rises to stand upright, leaning back with his arms outstretched to his sides for balance, he remains centrally framed, with his lower half appearing larger due to the camera's position at his level. The camera moves backward with the board, leading the surfer from the front, and rotates counterclockwise, with mild barrel distortion noticeable. The translucent, turquoise wall of the wave occupies the right and top of the frame in the middle ground, creating a tube around the subject. In the top-left background, the bright, sunlit opening of the wave's barrel is visible. The shot is slightly unsteady with some shaking, but a deep focus keeps both the surfer and the surrounding wave in clear view as he continues to glide through the tube.",

    "Camera": "This action shot is captured from a low angle, looking up at a surfer from a camera positioned on the surfboard. The camera moves backward with the board, leading the surfer from the front, and rotates counterclockwise. Mild barrel distortion is noticeable, and the shot is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus keeps both the surfer and the surrounding wave in clear view.",
    "Subject": "From a low-angle, point-of-view perspective, a man with a light complexion surfs inside a wave. He wears a black, short-sleeved wetsuit and black shorts. Initially, he is in a crouching position on his orange and red surfboard, which has a yellow nose. He then transitions to a kneeling position before rising to stand upright, leaning back with his arms outstretched to his sides for balance.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle, point-of-view shot, a surfer rides inside the barrel of a wave. He begins in a low, crouching position on the surfboard. He then pushes himself up to a standing position, leaning back and extending his arms out to his sides for balance as he continues to glide through the tube of the wave.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a surfboard captures the view from inside the barrel of a large ocean wave during the daytime. The water forms a hollow, turquoise-green tube, with the bright sun visible through the thin, translucent ceiling of the wave, creating a bright white glow. The lip of the wave is a churning mass of white foam, and water droplets spray through the air. A surfer in a black wetsuit rides on the primarily orange surfboard with a hint of yellow, illuminated by the bright light from above.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a surfer crouching in the center foreground, with the yellow nose of the surfboard visible at the bottom of the frame. As the surfer transitions to a kneeling position and then rises to stand upright with arms extended for balance, they remain centrally framed, and the shot continues to capture their entire figure, with their lower half appearing larger due to the camera's position at their level. The translucent, turquoise wall of the wave occupies the right and top of the frame in the middle ground, creating a tube around the subject. In the top-left background, the bright, sunlit opening of the wave's barrel is visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
