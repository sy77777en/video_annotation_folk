  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot with a focus on the midground, prominently displaying a right hand with a light to medium skin tone, appearing somewhat weathered with visible wrinkles and veins, gripping a dark, possibly black, fabric with thin, lighter-colored, possibly white or grey, horizontal stripes or a ribbed texture. The right hand is centered in the midground, while the right arm is positioned in the foreground on the left side, appearing blurred. In the center of the background, a left hand is visible, also gripping the fabric, but it is out of focus. The right arm is leaning forward and tilting towards the right side of the frame, with both hands' fingers slightly curled as if preparing to grasp the fabric more tightly. The background is a plain, light-colored surface, providing a clear view of the hands and fabric. The camera maintains a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, though the specific motion is unclear due to a lack of background cues. The scene is brightly lit, likely taking place outdoors during the daytime, with the right half of the frame being a light-colored, blurred background, and the main content concentrated in the center and left side. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the dynamics of the hands and fabric as they interact.",

    "Camera": "The camera maintains a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, though the specific motion is unclear due to a lack of background cues.",
    "Subject": "A close-up view shows a human hand with a light to medium skin tone, appearing somewhat weathered with visible wrinkles and veins. The right hand's fingers are slightly curled, resting on or gripping a dark, possibly black, fabric. This fabric features thin, lighter-colored, possibly white or grey, horizontal stripes or a ribbed texture. Additionally, a left hand is also resting on or gripping the same fabric.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a close-up of a person's hands, with both hands' fingers slightly curled as if preparing to grasp the fabric with horizontal stripes more tightly. The right arm is leaning forward and tilting towards the right side of the frame. The background is a plain, light-colored surface, providing a clear view of the hands and fabric.",
    "Scene": "The scene is a close-up, brightly lit shot, likely taking place outdoors during the daytime. The background is a uniformly light, out-of-focus expanse. Prominently featured is a human hand, its skin showing texture and veins, resting on or gripping a dark, possibly black, fabric. This fabric, which may be part of an item of clothing, also displays some lighter, striped or patterned details.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a close-up shot with a focus on the midground. A right hand is prominently centered in the midground, gripping a dark, striped fabric that extends to the left side of the frame. The right arm is positioned in the foreground on the left side, appearing blurred. In the center of the background, a left hand is visible, also gripping the fabric, but it is out of focus. The right half of the frame is a light-colored, blurred background, with the main content concentrated in the center and left side. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
