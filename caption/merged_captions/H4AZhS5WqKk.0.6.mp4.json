  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat's head, which occupies the left foreground of the frame. This cat has a white muzzle, long black whiskers, a black nose, and large yellow eyes. Positioned in the right foreground, a smaller, full-bodied red cat styled as a devil stands on a white, cloud-like object. The red cat has a lighter red belly, muzzle, and hands, small horns, a pointed tail, and a small black cape. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, creating a direct line of sight between them. This is a static shot filmed from a level angle, with the animated characters, Tom and a devil version of himself, remaining in sharp focus against a blurred, out-of-focus real-world background. The large cat's expression shifts from surprised to angry as its eyebrows furrow, and its head slightly turns and shakes. Simultaneously, the small red cat, standing on a cloud, first gestures with an open palm, then points an accusatory finger at the larger cat before putting its hand down and smiling, while its left hand holds a red trident. The background consists of dark, out-of-focus vertical structures, with slender white raindrops falling downward throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats in a confrontational scene. On the left, the head of a large, gray-blue cat is shown in a close-up. This cat has a white muzzle, long black whiskers, a black nose, and large yellow eyes; its expression changes from surprised to angry. Facing it on the right is a smaller, full-bodied red cat styled as a devil. This red cat has a lighter red belly, muzzle, and hands, small horns, a pointed tail, and a small black cape. It stands on a white, cloud-like object while holding a red trident and gesturing toward the larger cat with a shifting expression.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit, ambiguous space, a large, blue-gray cat with yellow eyes is seen in a close-up. The background is dark and out of focus, showing indistinct vertical structures, while slender white raindrops fall downward through the scene. Positioned in the foreground, a smaller, red cat wearing a devil costume with a cape and horns stands on a white, cloud-like shape. The red figure holds a matching red trident.",

The large cat's head slightly turns and shakes, while the smaller red cat on the right gestures with its right hand, extending it toward the larger cat, then puts it down, while its left hand holds a red trident.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
