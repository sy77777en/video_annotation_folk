  "merged_caption": "The video features a full shot of the subjects, capturing the entire figure and its surroundings. The animated silhouette of a humanoid figure with a round head and simplified body structure, lacking facial features and clothing details, is initially centered in the frame, moving towards the right. The camera smoothly moves rightward, tracking the animated silhouette of a person from the side as it walks from left to right against a stark white background with small green grass tufts scattered along the bottom, adding minimal color contrast. The setting is outdoors, featuring a minimalist environment with a simple, flat ground. As the figure continues walking, an open brown briefcase with a red interior and white papers inside appears on the right side of the frame, lying open on the ground, which adds a point of interest. The camera maintains a consistent side-view perspective at the subject's height, with no changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence. Sparse green grass tufts appear along the bottom of the frame. As the figure progresses, the open brown briefcase with a red interior enters the frame from the right, moving continuously across the bottom of the screen as the camera tracks the figure's movement. The figure eventually stops directly in front of the briefcase. The overall style is simplistic and monochromatic, focusing on the character's movement and interaction with the environment.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases an animated silhouette of a humanoid figure with a round head and simplified body structure, walking from left to right. The figure lacks facial features and clothing details. In the latter part of the video, the figure encounters an open brown briefcase with a red interior and white papers inside, positioned to the right of the figure. A few small green grass tufts are visible on the ground.",
    "Motion": "A black silhouette of a humanoid figure is walking from left to right against a white background with small green grass tufts at the bottom. As the figure continues walking, an open brown briefcase with a red interior and white papers inside appears on the right side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases an animated sequence with a side-view perspective of a character. The setting is outdoors, featuring a minimalist environment with a stark white background and a simple, flat ground. Sparse green grass tufts are scattered along the ground, adding minimal color contrast. The character, depicted as a solid black silhouette, moves across the scene, emphasizing motion. A notable element is a brown briefcase with a red interior, lying open on the ground, which adds a point of interest. The overall style is simplistic and monochromatic, focusing on the character's movement and interaction with the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
