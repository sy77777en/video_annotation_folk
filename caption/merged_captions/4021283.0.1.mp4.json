  "merged_caption": "The video captures the landscape with an extreme wide shot, showcasing terraced rice paddies that fill most of the frame from the bottom foreground to the top background. The rectangular plots and water channels crisscross the landscape, stretching into the distance and creating a strong sense of depth. Small huts are scattered throughout the scene, with some positioned in the foreground and others further away. A dense forest forms a horizontal band along the top background, with mist visible at the upper edge of the frame. The camera is positioned above the scene, looking down at a high angle, which emphasizes the scale and layout of the fields and elements. The framing remains consistent throughout the video, maintaining a broad aerial perspective over the landscape. The video begins with an aerial view of a vast agricultural area featuring numerous rectangular fields of varying shades of green and brown, indicating different stages of crop growth or types of crops. The camera steadily moves forward, providing a continuous view of the meticulously arranged fields, which are separated by narrow water channels. The background is filled with lush greenery and trees, suggesting a fertile and well-maintained agricultural region. As the camera progresses, more of the expansive fields come into view, showcasing the organized and vibrant agricultural activity. The camera is positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looking down over the rice fields. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements from the foreground to the background sharp. The drone moves smoothly forward above the fields while steadily panning left to adjust its orientation, providing a comprehensive view of the landscape. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a serene landscape scenery focusing on expansive rice paddies, with occasional appearances of huts that blend into the environment. The emphasis remains on the atmosphere, showcasing a patchwork of flooded fields with varying shades of green and brown. The paddies are neatly divided by narrow paths and irrigation channels, creating a geometric pattern. In the background, a dense line of trees and a misty horizon add depth, enhancing the sense of scale and tranquility. The presence of huts complements the vastness and serene beauty of the rural landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a vast agricultural area featuring numerous rectangular fields of varying shades of green and brown, indicating different stages of crop growth or types of crops.

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape of terraced rice fields bordered by dense green forest. The fields are divided into long, rectangular plots separated by narrow, water-filled channels that reflect the sky, with some areas displaying vibrant green growth and others showing brown, freshly tilled earth. Small wooden huts with sloped roofs are scattered throughout the fields, and the terrain is mostly flat with gentle undulations. The weather is clear, with soft daylight illuminating the scene, and the distant background fades into a light mist above the treetops.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
