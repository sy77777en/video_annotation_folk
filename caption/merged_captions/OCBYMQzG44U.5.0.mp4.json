  "merged_caption": "This video features a long, flooded corridor. The scene begins with a wide shot of the tiled hallway, which recedes from the foreground to the background. Water fills the center-bottom half of the frame, while a metal handrail runs along a low wall on the right side of the water. In the background, a large rubber duck is positioned in the center of the frame at the far end of the corridor. The camera, positioned at eye level, slowly zooms in on the large rubber duck at the end of the flooded, tiled hallway, maintaining a level angle with mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire eerie scene sharp throughout the movement. The shot has a slight shaking motion as it zooms in through the long, narrow, flooded indoor corridor. The walls, ceiling, and partitions are all covered in small, white tiles, and square light fixtures are set into the ceiling, illuminating the space with a sterile, clinical glow. Dark, rippling water fills the lower center half of the frame, and a metal handrail runs along a low wall on the right side of the water. At the far end of the corridor, a large, yellow rubber duck with wide, round eyes and a red-orange beak floats in a lit alcove. The scene then cuts to a full shot of the duck, centered in the frame, with the camera at its eye level. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest. The scene has a slight lens distortion effect, enhancing the surreal and disquieting atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera slowly zooms in on a large rubber duck at the end of a flooded, tiled hallway. The shot maintains a level angle and features mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire eerie scene sharp throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "This is a surreal interior scenery shot of a liminal space, characterized by a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by a series of stark, square light fixtures that cast a sterile, clinical glow. A simple metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the flooded passage, which recedes into the distance where a large, yellow rubber duck with wide eyes floats in an alcove. There is no main subject because the focus is on the disquieting atmosphere and the unsettling scale of the environment itself. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a shot of a long, flooded hallway with white tiled walls. A large, yellow rubber duck is visible above a rectangular space recessed into the wall at the far end of the hall. The scene then cuts to a full shot of the duck.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
