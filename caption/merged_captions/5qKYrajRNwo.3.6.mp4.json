  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a patterned curtain occupying the center and right of the frame in the middle ground. A portion of a puppet's face, featuring dark curly hair, is initially visible peeking from the left side of this curtain, positioned left of center in the middle ground. To the far left in the middle ground, a dark, metallic-looking container holds red and white toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste. The camera is static, positioned at eye-level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the midground. As the curtain is pulled to the right, the puppet moves slightly forward and to its right, emerging from behind the curtain to reveal its full face and upper body. The puppet, an adult male with dark, neatly combed hair, a prominent black mustache, and wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with thin vertical stripes and two buttons at the neck, is looking slightly downwards and to his left. This transition shifts the shot to a medium shot, with the puppet's upper body and head visible left of center in the middle ground, while the curtain is now predominantly on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The dimly lit area behind the puppet remains in the background, with indistinct shapes and colors suggesting a room beyond. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit space, where the curtain, predominantly in shades of blue and yellow with geometric designs, hangs centrally, partially obscuring the view. In the background, blurred cars can be seen moving, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall lighting is low, with a subtle warm glow on the right side of the curtain.",

    "Camera": "This is a stop-motion video. The camera is static, positioned at eye-level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a puppet character. Initially, the puppet is largely hidden behind a patterned curtain, with only a portion of its face visible, featuring dark curly hair. As the curtain is pulled further to the right, the puppet's wide eyes, full face, and upper body of an adult male puppet are revealed. This puppet has dark, neatly combed hair, a prominent black mustache, and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with thin vertical stripes and two buttons at the neck. He is looking slightly downwards and to his left.",
    "Motion": "A portion of a puppet's face peeks from the left side of a patterned curtain. The curtain is then pulled to the right, and simultaneously, the puppet moves slightly forward and to its right, emerging from behind the curtain to reveal its full face and upper body. In the background, blurred cars can be seen moving, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit space, where a patterned curtain, predominantly in shades of blue and yellow with geometric designs, hangs centrally, partially obscuring the view.

    "Spatial": "The video begins with a patterned curtain occupying the center and right of the frame in the middle ground. A portion of a puppet's face is initially visible peeking from the left side of this curtain, positioned left of center in the middle ground. To the far left in the middle ground, a container with toothbrushes is present. As the curtain is pulled further to the right, more of the puppet is revealed, transitioning the shot to a medium shot. In this final state, the puppet's upper body and head are visible left of center in the middle ground, while the curtain is now predominantly on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The dimly lit area behind the puppet remains in the background. The camera is at the puppet's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
