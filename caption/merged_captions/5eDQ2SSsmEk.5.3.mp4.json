  "merged_caption": "The video displays an extreme close-up shot of a textured surface, likely paper, with handwritten numbers. The shot size remains consistent throughout, focusing tightly on the details of the surface. The video begins with a blurry view of a red surface with handwritten numbers, gradually becoming clearer as the camera moves downward. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are positioned towards the center-left of the frame, with the latter becoming more prominent as the camera slightly shifts. These numbers are in the middle ground, while the icy texture and reflective particles are scattered across the entire frame, creating depth. The surface appears to be wet, with fresh droplets visibly falling onto it, creating a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus remains on the numbers and the wet texture, creating a visually striking composition. The camera features a high-angle view that tilts downward, employing an extremely shallow depth of field, resulting in an out-of-focus image initially. The movement is smooth and directed downward, maintaining minimal shaking. Towards the end, a clear segment of black text appears in the bottom right foreground of the frame, drawing attention to its details. The lighting is low, casting a bluish tint over the scene, creating a contrast with the reddish hue of the paper. The overall atmosphere is intimate and detailed, emphasizing the texture and markings on the paper. The camera maintains a steady height relative to the surface, capturing the intricate details without any noticeable change in angle. There are no significant changes in the spatial position of the elements.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle camera that tilts downward, focusing on a close-up of a surface with numbers. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, resulting in an out-of-focus image. The movement is smooth and directed downward, maintaining minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a close-up view of a red, textured surface resembling paper or fabric, with handwritten numbers prominently displayed. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are visible, written in bold, black ink. The surface appears to be wet, adding a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus is on the numbers and the wet texture, creating a visually striking composition.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a blurry view of a red surface with handwritten numbers, gradually becoming clearer as the camera moves downward. The numbers '87,000' and '90,000' become fully legible, with the '90,000' number becoming more prominent as the camera continues to move. The surface appears to be wet, with fresh droplets visibly falling onto it, creating a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus remains on the numbers and the wet texture, creating a visually striking composition.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a close-up view of a textured surface, possibly paper, with handwritten numbers and text. The setting is indoors, with a focus on the material's surface, which is marked by dark ink and appears to be slightly crumpled. The lighting is low, casting a bluish tint over the scene, creating a contrast with the reddish hue of the paper. The surface is speckled with what looks like small, reflective particles, adding a shimmering effect. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are prominently visible, suggesting a focus on these details. The overall atmosphere is intimate and detailed, emphasizing the texture and markings on the paper.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
