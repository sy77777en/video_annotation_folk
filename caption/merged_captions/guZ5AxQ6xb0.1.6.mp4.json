  "merged_caption": "The video features a slow-motion sequence of a male badminton player. It opens with a medium shot of the player, capturing his legs and feet as he jumps, revealing black athletic shorts, white socks, and bright yellow athletic shoes. The green court surface with white lines and \"YONEX\" branding extends from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, a blue advertising hoarding with a \"RedBull\" logo and \"China Construction Bank\" text spans the width of the frame. As the player jumps into the air, he raises his right arm, which holds a badminton racket, preparing to swing it, while his left arm is extended to the side for balance. The camera begins at a level angle, gently pans left, and then tilts upward to a low angle, seamlessly integrating the movements to reveal the badminton player swinging the racket. This action captures his upper body and arms mid-jump, dressed in a red polo shirt with white trim on the collar and sleeves, with his badminton racket also visible. The blue hoarding shifts to a lower position in the background, and the dimly lit spectator area, initially visible, eventually disappears from view. The court area is brightly illuminated, contrasting with the dimly lit spectator areas further back. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground, and the overall movement is very smooth. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, following his movement as he is captured mid-air, in the process of preparing to hit a shuttlecock.",

    "Scene": "The video is set on an indoor badminton court with a green playing surface marked by white boundary lines and \"YONEX\" branding. In the background, a prominent blue advertising hoarding displays a \"RedBull\" logo, featuring two red bulls and a yellow sun, alongside white text that includes \"China Construction Bank\" and other inscriptions. The court area is brightly illuminated, contrasting with the dimly lit spectator areas further back. A badminton player, wearing a red polo shirt, black shorts, and bright yellow athletic shoes, is seen on the court, captured in an upward jumping motion while actively swinging a racket.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
