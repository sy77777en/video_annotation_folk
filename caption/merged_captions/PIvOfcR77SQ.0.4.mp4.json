  "merged_caption": "This video captures a tranquil, snowy rural area in winter, focusing on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere of quiet isolation rather than a specific person or object. The scene is captured from an eye-level perspective, beginning with an extreme wide shot where a snow-covered path extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame to the center-right of the middle ground. In the middle ground, a red house and smaller buildings are positioned on the right, with a vast snowy field stretching across the lower part of the frame. A dark forest on a hill fills the background. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead across the snowy landscape. It uses deep focus, keeping both the foreground snow and distant houses sharp. The camera then pans left and zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot that reframes the composition to focus further on the middle ground. In this closer view, several white, circular yurts are now prominent in the center of the frame, with a small brown shed to their right, while the forest remains in the background. The movement is fast and slightly unsteady, with some visible shaking. A vast, snow-covered field stretches across the foreground and mid-ground under a gray, overcast sky, with snowflakes visibly falling. In the mid-ground, a cluster of white, circular yurts with conical roofs sits near a traditional red wooden house and a few smaller sheds, all blanketed in snow. A dark, dense forest of trees lines a distant hill, completing the serene and cold winter tableau.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snowy rural area in winter. The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere of quiet isolation rather than a specific person or object. A vast, snow-covered field stretches across the foreground and mid-ground under a gray, overcast sky, with snowflakes visibly falling. In the mid-ground, a cluster of white, circular yurts with conical roofs sits near a traditional red wooden house and a few smaller sheds, all blanketed in snow. A dark, dense forest of trees lines a distant hill, completing the serene and cold winter tableau.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a serene, snowy landscape. The scene features a vast, snow-covered field with several buildings, including red houses and white yurts, in the distance. A dark, forested hill lines the horizon under a grey, overcast sky as snow gently falls. The camera executes a slow pan to the left followed by a quick zoom in, but there is no other significant subject motion.",
    "Scene": "An extreme wide shot captures a rural landscape blanketed in snow under a grey, overcast sky while light snow falls. In the foreground and middleground, a vast, white field stretches out, with a snow-covered path visible from the bottom left to the center right. This path disappears as the camera zooms in. A cluster of buildings, including a prominent red wooden house and smaller outbuildings, sits on the edge of the field. Circular yurts, a small brown wooden shed, and additional wooden houses are scattered throughout the field. In the far distance, a dark forest of pine trees lines a hill.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
