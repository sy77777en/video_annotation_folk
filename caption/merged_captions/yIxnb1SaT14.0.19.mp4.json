  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of the Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre Paris Métro station, captured from a fixed high-angle perspective looking down into the scene. The shot is a time-lapse focused on the scenery, with the movement of people and a train being the primary dynamic elements. Initially, the green and white train arrives from the background to the foreground, stopping at the left platform, which extends from the foreground to the background. The central tracks run between the left platform and a second platform on the right, which also extends from the foreground to the background. As the time-lapse progresses, the train departs by moving from the foreground toward the background, revealing the empty tracks in the center. Concurrently, people on both platforms appear as motion blurs moving horizontally through the middle ground, contrasting with the static station architecture and the advertisements lining the wall in the right foreground and middle ground. The station features a distinctive arched, vaulted ceiling and walls lined with white brick tiles. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a very smooth trucking movement, steadily moving to the left as the train departs and people blur across the platform. The station itself is characterized by its classic vaulted, white-tiled ceiling and walls, with two platforms flanking the central tracks. As the train pulls away, it reveals the dark, intricate network of rails, while advertisements, including prominent ones for \"MAUBOUSSIN\" and \"PRINTEMPS,\" line the walls, adding a layer of commercial context to the public space. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHY.\"",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a high, overhead angle, looking down on a subway station. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a very smooth trucking movement, steadily moving to the left as a train departs and people blur across the platform.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot from a high-angle perspective overlooking a Paris Métro station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the atmosphere and the constant flow of movement within the urban environment. The technique of blurring the motion of commuters and the departure of a green and white train emphasizes the transient nature of the scene over any individual element. The station itself is characterized by its classic vaulted, white-tiled ceiling and walls, with two platforms flanking the central tracks. As the train pulls away, it reveals the dark, intricate network of rails, while advertisements, including prominent ones for \"MAUBOUSSIN\" and \"PRINTEMPS,\" line the walls, adding a layer of commercial context to the public space.",
    "Motion": "This is a high-angle, time-lapse shot of the Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre metro station in Paris. The scene captures the station's distinctive arched architecture, with white tiled walls and platforms flanking the tracks. The video shows a train departing and the blurred motion of commuters on the platforms.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse from a high-angle perspective captures a scene within a Paris Métro station, identified by a blue sign for \"Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre.\" The station features a distinctive arched, vaulted ceiling and walls lined with white brick tiles. A green and white train is initially stopped at the left platform before pulling away, revealing the dark tracks that run through the center of the station. On the platforms on either side, the blurred motion of people indicates the passage of time. The right platform wall is adorned with large advertisements, including one for \"MAUBOUSSIN.\" An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHY.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
