  "merged_caption": "In this abstract shot, a stream of golden particles is positioned diagonally, flowing in a gentle arc from the top left of the frame towards the bottom right. The particles, resembling glitter or dust, vary in size and shades of gold and yellow, with some appearing as bright, sparkling points of light. The individual particles drift and twinkle within this current, creating a slow and shimmering wave-like motion against the solid black background. The particles primarily occupy the middle ground, with a shallow depth of field creating a sense of dimension by blurring elements closer to and further from the focal plane. The blurred, diffuse particles in the foreground are mostly concentrated in the lower right corner, while the blurred particles in the background are mostly concentrated in the upper left corner. A faint, warm light source is suggested off-screen in the top right, casting a subtle glow across the scene. The camera remains completely static throughout the shot, with particles predominantly situated in the foreground, middle ground, and background. The use of a shallow depth of field keeps the middle ground in focus, effectively creating a sense of dimension by blurring elements that are closer to or further from the focal plane.",

    "Subject": "This abstract video showcases a flowing, curved stream of golden particles against a solid black background. The particles, which resemble glitter or dust, are of various sizes and shades of gold and yellow, with some appearing as bright, sparkling points of light. The stream moves in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. A shallow depth of field is employed, rendering some particles in sharp focus while others are softly blurred, creating a sense of dimension. A faint, warm light source in the upper right corner casts a subtle glow over the scene.",
    "Motion": "A stream of golden particles flows in a gentle, continuous arc from the upper left, curving down towards the lower right of the frame. The individual particles drift and twinkle within this current, creating a slow and shimmering wave-like motion against the dark background.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a stream of shimmering golden particles flows in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. The particles, varying in size and brightness, create a sense of depth with a shallow focus, where some are sharp and others are softly blurred. A faint, warm light source is suggested off-screen in the upper right, casting a subtle glow on the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
