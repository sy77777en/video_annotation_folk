  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, features pairs of disembodied, stylized white hands actively typing on black keyboards with teal-green backlit keys. Numerous identical workstations, each with a black, modern computer mouse with matching teal-green accents to the left of the keyboard, are arranged in a grid pattern, occupying the foreground to background across the frame. The setups are illuminated by circular spotlights against a completely dark background, creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce. As the hands work in unison, their fingers move rapidly and independently to press the keys, creating synchronized, continuous motion. The camera moves smoothly upward and moderately backward, revealing an ever-expanding grid of identical typing stations that stretch into the dark background. The scene expands wider but remains a wide shot throughout, revealing a vast, seemingly endless field of these typing stations that recede into the top of the frame. The scene is captured with a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp. An overlay with white text appears at the bottom left corner, stating, \"[43].\"",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the very smooth camera moves upward and moderately backward to reveal an endless expanse of disembodied hands typing on keyboards. The scene is captured with a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp.",
    "Subject": "A vast, organized array of disembodied, stylized white hands are shown actively typing on black keyboards. Each pair of smooth, matte-finished hands is positioned over a black, rectangular keyboard with teal-green backlit keys. In every instance, a black, modern computer mouse with matching teal-green accents sits to the side of a keyboard. The setups are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each station illuminated by a circular spotlight against a completely dark background, creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce.",
    "Motion": "A vast array of disembodied white hands continuously type on keyboards, their fingers moving rapidly and independently to press the keys. As the hands work in unison, the camera gradually moves upward and backward, revealing an ever-expanding grid of identical typing stations that stretch into the dark background.",
    "Scene": "In a vast, dark, and abstract space, countless pairs of disembodied white hands are arranged in a grid pattern, extending into the distance. Each pair of hands is actively typing on a black keyboard with glowing teal keys. These workstations are individually illuminated by spotlights from above, creating circular pools of light on the dark, striped floor. Every keyboard has a computer mouse to its left. The scene is characterized by the synchronized, continuous motion of the typing hands. An overlay with white text appears at the bottom left corner, stating, \"[43].\"",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, features pairs of disembodied hands typing on keyboards. Numerous identical workstations are arranged in a grid pattern, occupying the foreground to background across the frame. As the camera slowly pulls back and up, the scene expands wider but remains a wide shot throughout, revealing a vast, seemingly endless field of these typing stations that recede into the top of the frame. Each station, composed of hands, a keyboard, and a mouse to its left, is isolated by a circular spotlight in the dark environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
