  "merged_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person point-of-view, with the scene framed by a dark, rounded visor in the extreme foreground. The camera moves steadily forward with a slight rightward and downward drift through a dense, underwater environment, positioned at a high angle with a fixed Dutch tilt. Initially, a large, trunk-like structure with glowing pink and green elements dominates the left foreground. Numerous similar structures populate the middle ground and background across the entire frame, creating a sense of depth. These tall, stalk-like structures in green and brown hues are topped with flat, disc-shaped caps that have dark-blue tops and reddish-orange undersides. Additional structures grow on these stalks, including small pink rings, purple dots, and bioluminescent protrusions, with some areas emitting light. A large school of small, glowing, silvery fish-like creatures swarms and swirls from the central middle ground to the upper-left foreground, while a few small, blue, ray-like creatures glide through the water in the lower middle ground and background, near the seabed at the bottom of the frame. The seabed features sandy areas, green plants, and dark plants. As the camera advances, the foreground structure on the left moves past, and the viewer glides between the formations that were previously in the middle ground. The entire fantastical underwater environment is kept sharp and in view with deep focus, and the perspective is approximately forward but slightly down towards the seafloor. The murky, teal-colored water enhances the alien-like atmosphere, with bioluminescent blue manta rays visible at the bottom, completing the surreal underwater forest scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, first-person POV shot from an underwater perspective, positioned at a high angle with a fixed Dutch tilt. The camera moves steadily forward with a slight rightward and downward drift. A deep focus keeps the entire fantastical underwater environment sharp and in view.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an underwater, alien-like environment from a first-person perspective, viewed through a diving mask, which is represented by a dark, rounded border. The scene is dominated by numerous tall structures that resemble giant green-grey trunks. These structures feature broad, flat, disc-shaped tops with a dark blue upper surface and a reddish-orange stippled underside. The trunks emit glowing greenish lights from small areas around them, and some have bright pink, ring-like spots, fuchsia-colored dots, and small, glowing green bumps. Swimming through the murky teal water among these formations are large schools of small, silvery, glowing, fish-like creatures and a few bright blue manta rays.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the viewpoint drifts steadily forward, slightly to the right, and downward through a dense, underwater forest of tall, mushroom-like structures. A large school of small, glowing, silvery fish-like creatures swarms and swirls among the towering formations, while a few small, blue, ray-like creatures glide through the water in the background.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through a diver's eyes, moves through a fantastical underwater forest in murky, teal-colored water. The environment is populated by tall, stalk-like structures in green and brown hues, topped with flat, disc-shaped caps that have dark-blue tops and reddish-orange undersides. Additional structures grow on these stalks, including small pink rings, purple dots, and bioluminescent protrusions, with some areas emitting light. A school of small, silvery, bioluminescent fish-like creatures swims through the scene, accompanied by bioluminescent blue manta rays visible at the bottom. The entire scene is presented through a dark, rounded frame, like a helmet visor, with the bottom edge showing part of the visor. The seabed features sandy areas, green plants, and dark plants.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
