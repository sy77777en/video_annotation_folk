  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full, overhead shot, positioning the camera directly above a man wearing a white, short-sleeved turtleneck shirt and black pants, lying on a table with his head on a chair in the center of the frame. The black and white checkered floor occupies the background, while meandering, glowing orange lines are superimposed from the foreground to the middle ground. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, causing the entire scene to rotate 90 degrees and become upside down. During this transition, a second, shirtless man with dark skin is revealed from the bottom of the frame and ends up in the upper-center of the frame, occupying the upper portion in the final composition. The final composition is an inverted, low-angle shot from hip level, where both men remain stationary. The first man on the table is at the top of the frame, while the second man is in the upper portion. Light-colored, textured walls adorned with several framed pictures are visible in the background. The glowing orange lines remain as a stationary effect in both the foreground and middle ground throughout the shot. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins with an overhead, bird’s-eye view of a person on a checkered floor. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, transitioning to an upside-down, low-angle shot from hip level. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with an overhead, bird’s-eye view of a man wearing a white, short-sleeved turtleneck shirt and black pants, lying on his back on a table with his head on a chair, set against a checkered floor. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, transitioning to an upside-down, low-angle shot from hip level. As the camera moves, a second man, shirtless with dark skin, is revealed and remains visible throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an overhead view of a man lying on a table. The camera performs a continuous upward crane, causing the entire scene to rotate 90 degrees. This arcing camera movement reveals a second, shirtless man who is positioned upside down. The shot settles on a low, inverted angle, where both men remain stationary.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with an overhead, bird’s-eye view of a person lying with their back on a table and their head on a chair against a black and white checkered floor. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, transitioning to an upside-down, low-angle shot from hip level. The floor is covered in a black and white checkerboard pattern, and light-colored, textured walls are adorned with several framed pictures. A person stands nearby, making a total of two people in the scene. Meandering, glowing orange lines appear as a stationary effect, swirling around the figures and the room.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
