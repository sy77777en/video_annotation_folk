  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the full bodies of two men on a central escalator and a woman standing to the left. The larger man, a large individual with a prominent dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark suit, is positioned near the top center of the escalator in the middle ground, leaning forward with his hands outstretched. The smaller man, with a dark mustache and a dark suit, is directly below him, also centered, occupying the lower part of the escalator in the middle ground. The man higher on the escalator leans forward and extends his arms as he quickly descends the steps, but because the escalator is moving upward, his position remains in the same spot, appearing to reach toward the man below him. The man lower on the escalator moves downward, briefly losing his balance and stumbling as he continues to descend, then is carried upward after he falls and sits on the escalator. The woman, with dark, styled hair and wearing a dark coat with wide, white fur trim on the cuffs and collar over a lighter-colored dress, stands at the bottom left of the frame in the middle ground, near a counter, remaining stationary throughout the scene, watching in front of her without moving. Mannequins are visible to the far left in the foreground and to the left of the top of the escalator in the middle ground, while a display cabinet is in the right middle ground. A decorative balustrade and additional store elements fill the background above and behind the escalator. The camera remains at the subjects’ height, parallel to the escalator, and there is no significant change in shot size or camera angle during the scene. This slightly unsteady, eye-level shot is filmed from a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and performs a minor tilt downwards to follow the two men as they descend the escalator.",

    "Subject": "In a black-and-white scene, two men are on a central escalator moving upwards. The man positioned higher on the escalator is a large individual with a prominent dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark suit. He is leaning forward with his hands outstretched. Below him, a smaller man with a dark mustache and a dark suit is attempting to move down the escalator but is being pushed upwards after having fallen midway. To the left, a woman with dark, styled hair stands near a counter. She is wearing a dark coat with wide, white fur trim on the cuffs and collar over a lighter-colored dress.",
    "Motion": "The man higher on the escalator leans forward and extends his arms as he quickly descends the steps, but because the escalator is moving upward, his position remains in the same spot, appearing to reach toward the man below him.

The woman near the counter remains stationary throughout the scene, watching in front of her without moving.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in what appears to be a vintage clothing or department store, characterized by an escalator moving upward, a display case filled with various items, and mannequins dressed in period clothing. The environment features a cabinet filled with square packages and a decorative balustrade above the escalator. The lighting is even, suggesting daytime or well-lit interior conditions. The scene is presented in black and white, giving it a monochromatic appearance. Several people are present, with some attempting to descend on the escalator and others standing nearby, their attire matching the early 20th-century setting. No overlays, text, or digital elements are visible within the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the full bodies of the two men on the central escalator and the woman standing to the left.

The camera remains at the subjects’ height, parallel to the escalator, and there is no significant change in shot size or camera angle during the scene. The spatial arrangement keeps the escalator and its riders as the central focus, with supporting elements and other figures distributed along the left and right edges of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
