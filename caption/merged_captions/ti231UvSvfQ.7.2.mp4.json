  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the foreground on the left, an elderly, light-skinned man with wrinkled skin and thinning hair lies on his back in a bed, covered by a white sheet, with his head resting on a pillow. His eyes are closed, and his eyelids are twitching. In the middle ground on the right, a young, light-skinned man with short blond hair is seated, wearing a dark blue sweatshirt over a white t-shirt, holding an open blue folder. Initially, the young man glances at the document in the lower right before turning his head to look at the elderly man positioned to the bottom left. The older man's eyelids twitch, and his mouth moves slightly, while the younger man remains mostly still, staring with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression toward the man in the bed. A white desk lamp is positioned on the desk in the middle ground to the left, while an orange sharps container sits on a table to the far left. In the middle ground on the right, a green sign is visible, and in the background, a door is situated. The camera begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the younger man in the midground who is looking at a folder. A slow rack focus then shifts the focus to the older man lying in the bed in the foreground. The shot slowly moves backward, revealing more of the elderly man's body in the bed on the left. This scene takes place in a dimly lit, sterile-looking room with plain, light-gray walls. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, consisting mainly of grays and blues.",

He is wearing a dark blue sweatshirt over a white t-shirt and holds an open blue folder in his hands.

    "Scene": "This scene takes place in a dimly lit, sterile-looking room with plain, light-gray walls. An elderly person is lying in a bed with white sheets, positioned on the left side of the scene. A white, articulated desk lamp is on the table, but it is turned off. To the right, a young man in a blue sweatshirt is seated, holding an open blue folder. In the background, a door is visible, and a green sign is located on the wall. Next to the bed, a small table holds an orange sharps container. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, consisting mainly of grays and blues.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
