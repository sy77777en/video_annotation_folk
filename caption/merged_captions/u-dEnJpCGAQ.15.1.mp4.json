  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a leopard in the foreground, occupying the center of the frame. The leopard is shown lying down and looking directly forward with intense, amber-colored eyes, a pink nose, and long, white whiskers extending from its muzzle. Its coat is a yellowish-tan color, covered in a pattern of black spots and rosettes. Its ears are perked up, and dappled sunlight casts patches of light and shadow across its face and body. The camera is positioned at the leopard's level and performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the leopard's face, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the leopard in sharp focus. The leopard remains completely still, with only the gentle rise and fall of its abdomen with its breathing and the slight sway of its whiskers around its mouth. In the out-of-focus background, dark foliage is visible in the top left and center, with a wooden post positioned in the right background, suggesting a naturalistic enclosure or a wooded area.",

    "Scene": "A leopard is shown in a close-up view, situated in an outdoor setting during the day. Dappled sunlight filters through an unseen canopy, casting patches of light and shadow across its tawny, spotted coat and face. The animal looks directly forward with amber-colored eyes. In the out-of-focus background, there are hints of dark foliage and a thick, brown wooden post, suggesting a naturalistic enclosure or a wooded area.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot frames a leopard in the foreground, occupying the center of the frame. In the out-of-focus background, dark foliage is visible in the top left and center, with a wooden post positioned in the right background. The camera is positioned at the leopard's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
