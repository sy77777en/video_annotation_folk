  "merged_caption": "This point-of-view video begins with a worm's eye angle shot where the upper body of a person wearing a camouflage-patterned hat and jacket in shades of brown, tan, and dark green is visible in the top left foreground. A semi-automatic shotgun, also in matching camouflage, extends from the bottom left foreground toward the center, aimed up at the blue sky that fills the background, with tall reeds visible in the bottom right. The camera, fixed to the shotgun, exhibits mild barrel distortion and starts at a hip-level, worm's-eye angle. It moves upward with a counterclockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle, causing the person's body to move out of the frame and shifting the perspective to an eye-level view. The shotgun transitions from being pointed upward toward the sky to a horizontal aiming position, revealing a view across a marshy landscape with tall, dry reeds under a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The slightly unsteady movement settles at an eye-level, level view of a marshy field and distant mountains. In the final framing, the shotgun barrel occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom toward the center, with a light-skinned hand gripping it in the bottom center. The middle ground is filled with a field of tall reeds, while low, rolling hills on the horizon and the sky form the background. The view remains centered on the long barrel of the shotgun as it is held steady, aimed forward over the reeds, scanning the sunlit, marshy landscape. The scene is kept in deep focus, providing a clear view of the environment.",

    "Camera": "This locked-on point-of-view shot, focused on a shotgun, exhibits mild barrel distortion. It starts at a hip-level, worm's-eye angle and moves upward with a counterclockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle. The slightly unsteady movement settles at an eye-level, level view of a marshy field and distant mountains. The scene is kept in deep focus.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a fixed camera view focused on a person wearing a camouflage-patterned hat and jacket in shades of brown, tan, and dark green. The person holds a semi-automatic shotgun, which is also covered in a matching camouflage pattern. Initially, the gun is held low, with the person's head and shoulder visible. The shotgun is then raised into an aiming position, causing the person's upper body to move out of the frame. The view remains centered on the long barrel of the shotgun and a light-skinned hand gripping its fore-end.",
    "Motion": "A camera fixed to a shotgun captures the movement as it transitions from being pointed upward toward the sky to a horizontal aiming position. This reveals a view across a marshy landscape with tall, dry reeds under a clear blue sky. The shotgun is then held steady, aimed forward over the reeds.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a shotgun provides a view from within a dense field of tall, dry reeds under a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The camouflage-patterned barrel of the gun, held by a person in matching attire, points forward as the perspective shifts, scanning the sunlit, marshy landscape. In the distance, beyond the golden-brown vegetation, a line of low, rolling hills is visible on the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "This point-of-view video begins with a worm's eye angle shot where the upper body of a person is visible in the top left foreground. A shotgun extends from the bottom left foreground toward the center, aimed up at the blue sky that fills the background, with tall reeds visible in the bottom right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
