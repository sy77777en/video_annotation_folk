  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a lush, natural landscape dominated by a waterfall. The waterfall is centrally positioned in the middle ground, with its two streams falling into a small pool below. Initially, several people are visible near the base of the waterfall in the middle ground, located in the bottom center of the frame. As the video progresses, these individuals gradually move out of the frame, leaving the waterfall as the sole focal point. The dense greenery surrounds the waterfall, occupying the left, right, and upper portions of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. The rocky terrain is situated around the waterfall, forming part of the middle ground. The camera starts with a high vantage point above the waterfall, captured from a drone POV, and as it moves, it descends to approximately the same height as the waterfall, offering a comprehensive view of the entire scene. The video begins with a view of a lush, green forest, with dense foliage and tall trees surrounding a waterfall. The waterfall cascades down a rocky cliff into a small, dark brown pool of water at the bottom. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the surrounding greenery. The camera is at an aerial level, starting with a high angle and transitioning to a level angle. It moves forward and downward, with a slight upward tilt midway. The focus is deep, maintaining clarity throughout, and the movement is smooth and steady. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the vibrant green foliage and the rocky terrain. The waterfall, with its clear, flowing water, adds a dynamic element against the earthy tones of the rocks. The surrounding forest is dense with various trees and plants, adding texture and depth to the landscape.",

    "Camera": "The video features a drone POV capturing woods and waterfalls. The camera is at an aerial level, starting with a high angle and transitioning to a level angle. It moves forward and downward, with a slight upward tilt midway. The focus is deep, maintaining clarity throughout, and the movement is smooth and steady.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the lush greenery and the waterfall. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale of the landscape rather than a specific object, creating a sense of immersion in the natural setting.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a lush, green forest, with dense foliage and tall trees surrounding a waterfall. The waterfall cascades down a rocky cliff into a small, dark brown pool of water at the bottom. Several people can be seen standing near the base of the waterfall, some closer to the water and others on the rocky shore. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the surrounding greenery.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, outdoor setting featuring a waterfall with two distinct streams cascading into a small pool surrounded by dense greenery. The stream on the right has a larger flow, while the stream on the left has a smaller flow, creating a dynamic contrast. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the vibrant green foliage and the rocky terrain. The waterfall, with its clear, flowing water, adds a dynamic element against the earthy tones of the rocks. The surrounding forest is dense with various trees and plants, adding texture and depth to the landscape. The area around the pool is dotted with rocks and patches of grass, providing a natural, serene environment. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the waterfall's height and the expansive greenery enveloping the area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
