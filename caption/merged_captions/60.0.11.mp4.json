  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on a player in a light blue uniform positioned in the left foreground, with a white and orange soccer ball at the bottom center. A second player in a yellow jersey is visible in the top left middle ground. The green soccer field occupies the majority of the frame, with trees and buildings situated in the distant background across the top. The handheld camera starts with a high-angle shot at hip level, tracking rightward alongside the soccer player in blue. The player in the light blue uniform runs across the field while dribbling the ball with their right foot, and the ball rolls and bounces just ahead of them as they move. The camera tilts upward to briefly capture a low-angle view of the player's head before tilting back down to achieve a level angle. As the video progresses, the camera transitions into a full shot, maintaining deep focus to keep both the player and the field sharp. The main player and the ball move across the foreground, and the player in the yellow jersey, who is running in pursuit from behind and to the left, disappears from the frame. The main player in the light blue uniform becomes the central focus in the foreground, while the background scrolls from right to left. The scene is set on a bright, sunny day on a green artificial turf soccer field, with a line of green trees and a fence separating the field from several multi-story buildings in the distance. The focus remains on the player in the light blue uniform as they move with the ball, wearing dark purple knee-high socks and white athletic shoes, while the second person in a yellow short-sleeved jersey and dark-colored shorts is briefly visible.",

    "Scene": "On a bright, sunny day, the scene is set on a green artificial turf soccer field. In the background, a line of green trees and a fence separate the field from several multi-story buildings in the distance. A white and orange soccer ball is in motion, being dribbled across the turf. The legs of a player wearing a light-colored jersey, purple socks, and white shoes are visible in the foreground, moving quickly alongside the ball.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
