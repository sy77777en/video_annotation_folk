  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot filmed at the subjects' level, a man with light skin and short, dark hair is seated in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame, positioned in the foreground at a long, dark wood table. He is wearing a white collared shirt, a dark green patterned vest, and a green bow tie. A woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in an updo initially stands slightly to the right of the center of the frame in the middle ground. She is wearing a white shirt and a separate skirt as her inner layer, complemented by a light beige lace vest over it. The background is occupied by a large wooden mantelpiece and fireplace on the right and wood-paneled walls. The scene is set in an opulent indoor room from a historical period, characterized by dark, patterned wallpaper and extensive wood paneling with carved arches. A large fireplace with a dark green surround is topped by an elaborate wooden mantelpiece, which holds decorative items including a white taxidermy bird and a blue and white vase. During the shot, the woman walks from the left rear of the seated man to his right side, passing behind his chair, and the camera tilts down and pans left to track her as she moves across the room, keeping the foreground in focus. As she moves, she looks down at the man, who lets out a deep sigh and then speaks while seated at the table with his head bowed. The camera maintains a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle and shallow focus, emphasizing her movement as she ultimately arrives at the center of the frame in the middle ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
