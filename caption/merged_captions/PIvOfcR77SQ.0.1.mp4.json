  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot shows a man with a medium skin tone, a dark beard, and a mustache in the center foreground. He is wearing a black hooded jacket with the hood pulled up over his head and a light blue backpack on his chest, with an orange strap-like decoration near his right shoulder. He stands beside a snowy road that initially occupies the right side of the frame, stretching from the middle ground into the background. A forest of tall, thin trees fills the background on both sides of the road, with power lines visible running along the left side. A dark box is visible in the bottom left middle ground at first, but it eventually goes out of frame from the left side as the camera moves. The power lines also go out of frame from the left side later. As the perspective changes, the snowy road eventually stretches across the scene from right to left. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the man in the foreground and the snowy landscape in sharp detail. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the man, with minimal shaking. The man stands in one spot in a snowy landscape, speaking to the camera. His head moves slightly as he talks, and his body sways gently. Midway through the video, he begins to slowly move forward. The scene is a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed and is facing them, showing a snowy, rural landscape. The person stands beside a road that runs alongside a forest of tall, thin trees. The ground, road shoulders, and surrounding area are completely covered in a thick layer of white snow. Power lines are visible running alongside the road into the distance under a flat, overcast sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
