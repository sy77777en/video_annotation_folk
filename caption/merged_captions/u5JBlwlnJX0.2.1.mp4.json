  "merged_caption": "This is a dynamic, over-the-shoulder shot featuring a gray rat with large pink ears positioned in the left foreground with its back to the camera, occupying the left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the rat's level, capturing a smooth, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the television in the background in focus. The setting is a dimly lit, rustic kitchen during the day. In the center-right background, a vintage, boxy television with antennas sits on a dark wooden hutch, displaying a close-up of a large, fair-skinned man in a white chef's uniform and a tall chef's hat, appearing to speak with an animated expression. To the left of the television, also in the background, is a small, black fan. On a counter in the right middle ground, a light-colored bowl contains green and red fruit beside a rolling pin. A window covered by a sheer curtain is visible in the background. The scene features the rat subtly moving its head and ears. On the television screen, the chef raises his hand and points his finger forward. The camera simultaneously moves backward while zooming in, creating a dolly zoom effect, enhancing the focus on the animated expression of the chef on the screen. The primary light source in the room comes from the television screen, casting a glow that highlights the rustic elements of the kitchen.",

    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The setting is a dimly lit, rustic kitchen during the day. In the center of the room, a vintage, boxy television with antennas rests on a dark wooden hutch, its black-and-white screen displaying a man in a chef's uniform. A small, black fan stands next to the television. To the right, on a wooden counter, a light-colored bowl contains green and red fruit beside a rolling pin. In the background, a window is covered by a sheer curtain, and the overall lighting is low, with the primary light source coming from the television screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
