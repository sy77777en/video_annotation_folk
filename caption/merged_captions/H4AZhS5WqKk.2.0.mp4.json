  "merged_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, showing Tom the Cat from the waist up, centered in the frame and occupying the middle ground directly behind a window. The window frame is positioned on both sides, with the glass in the center foreground, spanning the bottom and sides of the frame. Tom’s right hand and finger are raised and extended toward the glass at the center. Tom’s face and upper body are positioned centrally, with his head and ears near the top center and his torso extending downward. The cityscape, including tall buildings with illuminated windows and a cylindrical water tower, fills the background, with the water tower slightly right of center. Rain is visible throughout the scene, with droplets and streaks on the glass in the foreground. The camera is static at a low angle, using a shallow depth of field with the window frame and glass in the foreground and Tom positioned in the middle ground. As the video progresses, Tom extends a finger of his right hand, using his sharp black nail to slice a perfect circle into the glass. He then pushes the circular cut-out away with his finger, maintaining a steady posture throughout the action. His fur appears textured and dampened by the rain, and his expression is stern. A lightning flash occurs once in the video, adding a dramatic element to the scene. The framing and depth remain consistent, with Tom as the central subject, the window in the foreground, and the cityscape in the background. The setting suggests a cityscape, but the focus remains on Tom's distinctive appearance and gesture.",

    "Subject": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic cat with dark gray fur, a lighter gray face and chest, and large, pointed ears with pink interiors. The cat has prominent yellow eyes, a small black nose, and a white mouth and hands. Its expression is serious, with a slightly furrowed brow. This is the classic image of Tom the Cat from the animated series Tom and Jerry. Tom is depicted extending a finger of his right hand, using his sharp black nail to cut a circle on the glass in front of him. The setting suggests a cityscape, but the focus remains on Tom's distinctive appearance and gesture.",
    "Motion": "Tom extends a finger of his right hand, using his sharp black nail to slice a perfect circle into the glass. He then pushes the circular cut-out away with his finger, maintaining a steady posture throughout the action.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors at night in a city environment, with rain falling steadily and droplets visible in the air. Tall buildings with illuminated windows and glowing signage form the urban skyline in the background, while a cylindrical water tower with a weathered, brown surface stands prominently among the structures. The sky is dark, and the wet surfaces reflect the city lights, adding a glossy sheen to the scene. In the foreground, there is a brown window frame with a central glass pane. Behind the glass stands Tom, a large, animated gray and white cat with pink inner ears and yellow eyes. His fur appears textured and dampened by the rain, and his expression is stern. Water droplets and streaks are visible on the glass. A lightning flash occurs once in the video, adding a dramatic element to the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a medium shot, showing Tom the Cat from the waist up, centered in the frame and occupying the middle ground directly behind a window. The window frame is positioned on both sides, with the glass in the center foreground, spanning the bottom and sides of the frame. Tom’s right hand and finger are raised and extended toward the glass at the center. Tom’s face and upper body are positioned centrally, with his head and ears near the top center and his torso extending downward. The cityscape, including tall buildings with illuminated windows and a cylindrical water tower, fills the background, with the water tower slightly right of center. Rain is visible throughout the scene, with droplets and streaks on the glass in the foreground. The camera is placed slightly low, facing Tom with a subtle low-angle shot. As the video progresses, Tom’s finger moves in a circular motion on the glass, cutting a circle; his body stays mostly stationary, maintaining the same spatial relationship to the camera and window. The framing and depth remain consistent, with Tom as the central subject, the window in the foreground, and the cityscape in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
