  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring a young boy with short, dark hair and light skin, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is kneeling on a circular green rug, wearing light-colored, striped pajamas and is barefoot. A small brown teddy bear is to his left, and a miniature silver-colored Ferris wheel is directly in front of him. The boy subtly tilts his head upward amidst the surrounding toys. In the background, a large, multi-paned window is visible to the left of center, looking out onto a city with tall buildings, where pink and purple lights glow through rain-streaked glass. The scene is set within a large, dimly lit room at night, featuring dark wooden floors. The surrounding floor is sparsely scattered with other toys, including a red toy car on the bottom right, a toy soldier on the bottom left, and a toy carousel in the middle ground to the left of the boy. The room is primarily illuminated by warm light from within, while the cool light from the window also plays a significant role in creating a dark and shadowed interior. The camera is positioned at the boy's level, with a shallow depth of field keeping the focus on the boy and his toys in the midground. The shot smoothly moves to the left, maintaining the focus on the boy and his interaction with the toys, while the considerable depth of the scene is highlighted by the various out-of-focus toys scattered in the foreground.",

    "Subject": "A young boy with short, dark hair and light skin is kneeling on a dark, patterned rug, his back to the viewer. He is wearing light-colored, striped pajamas and is barefoot. In front of him sits a small, brown teddy bear, also facing away from the viewer. Both the boy and the teddy bear are looking towards a miniature, metallic Ferris wheel. Several other small toys, including a toy carousel, a red toy car, a toy soldier, and a toy horse with a rider, are scattered on the rug and the wooden floor around them.",
    "Motion": "The scene is mostly static, with the boy subtly tilting his head upward amidst the surrounding toys.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a large, dimly lit room at night, featuring dark wooden floors. A prominent multi-paned window looks out onto a city with tall buildings, where pink and purple lights glow through what appears to be rain-streaked glass. In the center of the room, a child in striped pajamas kneels on a circular green rug. On the rug are a small brown teddy bear, a miniature silver-colored Ferris wheel, and some papers. The surrounding floor is sparsely scattered with other toys, including a red toy car, a miniature carousel, and a toy soldier. The room is primarily illuminated by warm light from within, while the cool light from the window also plays a significant role in creating a dark and shadowed interior.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot featuring a young boy positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He kneels on a circular rug, also in the center middle ground, with a teddy bear to his left and a miniature Ferris wheel directly in front of him. In the background, a large window is visible to the left of center. The scene has considerable depth, with various out-of-focus toys scattered in the foreground, such as a toy soldier on the bottom left and a red car on the bottom right. Other toys, like a toy carousel, are in the middle ground to the left of the boy. The camera is positioned at the boy's level, and the shot smoothly moves to the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
