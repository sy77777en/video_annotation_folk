  "merged_caption": "In a level-angle medium shot, the lower bodies of several people run through a sunlit forest. The ground, covered in a thick layer of brown pine needles and dirt, is a heavily blurred element in the immediate foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame. The camera, positioned very low to the ground, trucks and pans left to follow the running feet, creating significant motion blur throughout the scene. In the middle ground, the legs of a person in light-colored pants and white sneakers are in the center, with another person in green pants to the left and a third in blue jeans just right of center. A woman with a darker skin tone is visible in the middle ground at the top right, running in a brown crop top and blue jeans among tall, slender trees with green leaves that extend across the background against a bright sky. The individuals move perpendicular to the camera's viewpoint, heading to the left and deeper into the sunlit woods, creating a sense of urgent motion as the ground blurs past. The rapid movement of the group, wearing casual attire including blue jeans, green pants, and beige pants, along with light-colored sneakers, is captured from a shaky, ground-level perspective, making the image indistinct due to significant motion blur. The dappled sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating the scene as the camera follows their legs and feet, enhancing the dynamic forward motion of the group.",

    "Subject": "A group of people runs through a wooded area from a low-angle perspective. In the midground, the most prominent figure wears light-colored pants and white sneakers. Just behind them, another person is visible in green pants. In the foreground, a person wears blue jeans, and further back, a woman with a darker skin tone is seen running in a brown crop top and blue jeans.",
    "Motion": "From a level perspective close to the ground, a group of people runs rapidly through a wooded area. The camera follows their legs and feet as they sprint across the pine-needle-covered forest floor, creating a sense of urgent motion as the ground blurs past. The individuals move perpendicular to the camera's viewpoint, heading to the left and deeper into the sunlit woods.",
    "Scene": "From a level, ground-level perspective, a group of people runs through a sunlit forest. The ground is covered in a thick layer of brown pine needles and dirt.

The individuals are wearing casual attire, including blue jeans, green pants, and beige pants, along with light-colored sneakers.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
