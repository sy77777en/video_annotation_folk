  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, the side of a man's head with dark skin occupies the left foreground, looking downward toward the center of the frame. In the center middle ground, a middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark, graying hair and a short matching beard is visible from the top of his shoulders upwards, wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, with a small white bandage on his right forehead. The scene is set within a dimly lit interior characterized by predominantly cool, blue colors, with yellowish tube lights hanging from the ceiling. The background is dark and out of focus, featuring only the ceiling and the hanging tube lights. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' eye level throughout the clip, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the man in the midground. The man in the suit slowly lifts his head, his eyes moving around thoughtfully as his mouth closes, suggesting he is deep in contemplation. The camera performs a smooth, minor upward tilt, enhancing the sense of introspection. In the left foreground, the dark-skinned man remains relatively still. An out-of-focus figure is positioned in the foreground, creating a perspective that looks toward the main subject.",

    "Subject": "A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark, graying hair and a short matching beard is shown in a close-up, looking toward a dark-skinned man. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, and has a small white bandage on his right forehead. In the foreground, the side profile of the dark-skinned man's head is visible as he looks downward toward the center of the frame.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit interior characterized by predominantly cool, blue colors, with the exception of yellowish tube lights hanging from the ceiling. An out-of-focus figure is positioned in the foreground, creating a perspective that looks toward the main subject. The background is dark and indistinct, featuring only the ceiling and the hanging tube lights. In the mid-ground, a man with a salt-and-pepper beard is shown wearing a dark suit, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie. A small, white bandage is visible on his right temple.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up shot, the side of a man's head with dark skin occupies the left foreground. In the center middle ground, another man in a suit is visible from the top of his shoulders upwards, looking slightly upwards. The background is dark and out of focus.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
