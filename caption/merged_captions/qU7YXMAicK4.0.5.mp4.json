  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a greenhouse interior, focusing on the spatial arrangement and growth of large, leafy green plants. Initially, the plants are positioned in the upper background, with their broad leaves extending outward. The soil beds extend from the foreground to the background, lined with black irrigation hoses running parallel to the rows of plants. Wooden planks are placed intermittently across the soil, serving as walkways. The camera is positioned at eye level and angled high, looking down at the plants, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field to capture all elements sharply. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. As the video progresses, through time-lapse photography, the plants extend further, gradually occupying more space in the frame, highlighting their growth and expansion over several days or even months, all condensed into just a few seconds. The translucent greenhouse structure allows natural light to filter through, enhancing the visibility of the plants and the overall scene. The plastic wall is situated in the middle ground and background, surrounding the soil beds. The environment is orderly, with the greenhouse structure visible, characterized by a series of raised soil beds lined with black irrigation hoses. On one side, a row of large, leafy green plants adds a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones of the soil. The setting suggests a focus on cultivation, with the plants appearing healthy and well-maintained. The overall atmosphere is calm and organized, with the time-lapse effect highlighting the dynamic changes in the scene. The plants are large and leafy, with some leaves spreading outwards, indicating healthy growth.",

    "Camera": "The video is a time-lapse showing rapid growth of plants in a greenhouse. The camera is positioned at eye level and angled high, looking down at the plants. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing all elements sharply. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a greenhouse setting with a series of large, leafy green plants growing in rows. These plants have broad, vibrant green leaves and are arranged in a neat, organized pattern. The soil appears well-tended, with visible irrigation hoses running parallel to the rows of plants. The plants are positioned towards one end of the greenhouse, with some leaves sprawling outward, indicating healthy growth. The greenhouse structure includes a translucent covering, allowing natural light to filter through, enhancing the visibility of the plants' lush foliage.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a greenhouse with rows of plants growing in the soil, with irrigation hoses laid out in parallel lines. The plants are large and leafy, with some leaves spreading outwards, highlighting their growth and expansion. The background includes the greenhouse structure with translucent walls, allowing light to penetrate the space.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a greenhouse, characterized by a series of raised soil beds lined with black irrigation hoses. The environment is orderly, with wooden planks placed intermittently across the soil, likely serving as walkways. On one side, a row of large, leafy green plants adds a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones of the soil. The greenhouse structure is visible, with translucent plastic walls allowing diffused natural light to illuminate the space. Through time-lapse photography, the video captures the growth of the plants over several days or even months, all condensed into just a few seconds. The setting suggests a focus on cultivation, with the plants appearing healthy and well-maintained. The overall atmosphere is calm and organized, with the time-lapse effect highlighting the dynamic changes in the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a greenhouse interior, focusing on the spatial arrangement and growth of large, leafy green plants. Initially, the plants are positioned in the upper background, with their broad leaves extending outward. The soil beds extend from the foreground to the background, lined with black irrigation hoses running parallel to the rows of plants. Wooden planks are placed intermittently across the soil, serving as walkways. As the video progresses, the plants extend further, gradually occupying more space in the frame. The camera remains at the same level as the plants throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective that highlights the orderly arrangement and dynamic growth within the greenhouse setting. The translucent greenhouse structure allows natural light to filter through, enhancing the visibility of the plants and the overall scene. The plastic wall is situated in the middle ground and background, surrounding the soil beds."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
