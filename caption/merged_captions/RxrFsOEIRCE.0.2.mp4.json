  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-altitude, forward-moving perspective. The frame is dominated by a vast green field in the foreground and middle ground, which fills the lower two-thirds of the view. Two parallel dirt tracks begin at the bottom center and extend into the middle ground, creating strong leading lines. A small, dark shadow of the drone is consistently positioned in the bottom center foreground, skimming over the crops. In the middle ground, a tree-lined hill extends from the left towards the center. The background is composed of a blue sky with white clouds, occupying the top third of the frame. The camera flies forward and descends over the green field, starting from an aerial, high-angle view and smoothly tilting up to transition to an eye-level, level-angle perspective. During this smooth flight, the camera also rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire landscape sharp, while some barrel distortion is present, adding a unique visual effect to the scene. The rapid forward motion creates a blur effect on the surrounding landscape, enhancing the dynamic sense of speed. The camera skims across the vibrant green field, following the two parallel dirt tracks that lead up a gentle slope. At the top of the hill is a dense forest under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The focus of the video is on the immersive experience of flight and the expansive scale of the rural environment, rather than on a specific subject. The rapid movement creates a dynamic sense of speed, making the landscape itself the central element.",

    "Camera": "This is a drone shot featuring advanced and complex camera work. The camera flies forward and descends over a green field, starting from an aerial, high-angle view and smoothly tilting up to transition to an eye-level, level-angle perspective. During this smooth flight, the camera also rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire landscape sharp, while some barrel distortion is present, adding a unique visual effect to the scene.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a fast-paced, low-altitude landscape scenery shot from an aerial perspective, likely captured by an FPV drone. The camera speeds across vast, flat farmland covered in vibrant green crops, with parallel dirt tracks creating strong leading lines that stretch towards a treeline in the distance. Above, a brilliant blue sky is dotted with fluffy white clouds. The focus of the video is on the immersive experience of flight and the expansive scale of the rural environment, rather than on a specific subject. The rapid movement creates a dynamic sense of speed, making the landscape itself the central element. A small, dark, cross-shaped shadow of the drone can be seen skimming across the ground, reinforcing the first-person perspective of the flight.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, first-person view from a drone flying low and fast over a landscape. The camera skims across a vibrant green field, following two parallel dirt tracks that lead up a gentle slope. At the top of the hill is a dense forest under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a low, high-speed flight over a vast, green field under a blue sky with white clouds. The drone follows a pair of parallel, brown tracks that run through the field toward a gentle slope in the distance, covered with green trees. A small, dark, cross-shaped shadow of the drone is present in the lower center of the view. The rapid forward motion creates a blur effect on the surrounding landscape.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-altitude, forward-moving perspective. The frame is dominated by a vast green field in the foreground and middle ground, which fills the lower two-thirds of the view. Two parallel dirt tracks begin at the bottom center and extend into the middle ground, creating strong leading lines. A small, dark shadow of the drone is consistently positioned in the bottom center foreground, skimming over the crops. In the middle ground, a tree-lined hill extends from the left towards the center. The background is composed of a blue sky with white clouds, occupying the top third of the frame. The camera moves rapidly forward at a very low height, causing the foreground and middle ground elements to rush past and blur, while the drone's shadow remains fixed in the bottom center, reinforcing the first-person flight perspective."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
