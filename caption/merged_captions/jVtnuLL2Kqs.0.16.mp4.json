  "merged_caption": "This video showcases a classical-style building. The scene begins with a level-angle wide shot of a large stone column, positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. The camera is at a smooth, eye-level, and level angle, capturing the impressive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment. The building's curved wall is in the middle ground, with a city street visible in the background on the right, featuring buildings, streetlights, and multiple cars passing by under an overcast sky, with wet pavement reflecting the muted light. The camera moves backward, revealing the grand entrance and steps of the building with a varying Dutch angle as it rolls counterclockwise. In the final composition, a fence occupies the foreground, while a broad set of stone steps leads up to the columns and building facade, all in the middle ground. The structure features light-colored stone block walls and a window with a grid pattern. Other similar columns line the colonnade. A white logo is consistently positioned in the bottom right corner of the screen. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, emphasizing the massive, round stone base of the large column before pulling back to reveal the wide set of stone steps leading up to the building's curved facade.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot focused on a grand, classical-style building. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing the impressive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment rather than a specific person or object. The shot emphasizes the massive, round stone base of a large column before pulling back to reveal a wide set of stone steps leading up to the building's curved facade.

    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of the exterior of a large, classical-style building, featuring prominent stone pillars and wide steps. The camera begins with a level angle view of a pillar's base and then moves back, rolling counterclockwise to reveal the grand entrance and steps of the building with a varying Dutch angle.",
    "Scene": "Set outdoors on an overcast day, the scene captures a grand, classical-style building with a curved facade. The camera starts with a level angle on the molded base of a large, white stone column, then pulls back to reveal a wide, wet stone pavement and a set of broad stone stairs. The building's walls are made of light-brown stone blocks, and other similar columns line the colonnade. In the background, a city street is visible with buildings, streetlights, and multiple cars. A white logo is present as an overlay in the bottom right corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
