  "merged_caption": "The video is a scenery shot, presenting an extreme wide shot of an airport at night, captured from an aerial perspective looking down. The illuminated airport layout, featuring runways and taxiways, occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom towards the center. The main runways are oriented at a slight angle, running from the bottom towards the center of the frame, while intersecting taxiways and another runway extend across the middle. The brightly lit terminal complex is positioned in the top left quadrant, situated in the middle. The surrounding dark area, representing undeveloped land or water, fills the background and the periphery of the frame. The camera is positioned at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view of the airport at night. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera exhibits minor movement, arcing counterclockwise around the airport, with a slight shaking noticeable in the footage. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere, highlighting the illuminated runways, taxiways, and terminal building against the dark surroundings, rather than a specific object. The runways and taxiways are outlined with green and white lights, creating a distinct pattern, while the central terminal complex is brightly lit, showcasing its structure. The scene is dark, with the airport layout illuminated by lights. Runways and taxiways are clearly defined by continuous green edge lighting and dotted white centerline lights. A central terminal complex, appearing somewhat circular or star-shaped, is brightly lit with white lights. The surrounding area is very dark, suggesting undeveloped land or water.",

    "Motion": "This is a night-time aerial view of an airport. The runways and taxiways are illuminated with green and white lights, and the terminal building is also lit up. The surrounding area is dark.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a nighttime aerial view of an airport. The scene is dark, with the airport layout illuminated by lights.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
