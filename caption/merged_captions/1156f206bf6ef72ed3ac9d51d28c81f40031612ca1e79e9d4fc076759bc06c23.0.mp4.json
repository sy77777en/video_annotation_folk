  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot captures a woman with medium-length dark hair, wearing a sleeveless top, in the foreground, positioned in the center against a dark background. The scene takes place in a dark, indoor environment with a black background, illuminated by dynamic, colored lights that shift between red, green, and purple hues, creating vibrant patterns on her skin and clothing. Initially, she is viewed from the side, swaying her body in a dimly lit space with flashing colored lights. As she moves, the perspective alternates between side and behind views, and she turns her head to the side, revealing her profile. The lighting emphasizes her facial features and the contours of her body, suggesting a lively atmosphere. She then raises both arms above her head, which move in and out of the top of the frame. Although the camera remains fixed, there is noticeable shakiness in the footage. This is a slightly unsteady, static shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the woman dancing in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dark, indoor environment against a black background. The space is illuminated by dynamic, colored lights that shift between red, green, and purple. These lights move across the scene, briefly highlighting a woman with medium-length dark hair worn down who is dancing.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
