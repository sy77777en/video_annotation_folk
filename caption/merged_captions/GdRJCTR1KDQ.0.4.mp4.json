  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a tricolor dog's head in the foreground against a vibrant green lawn in the background. The dog, with long black, tan, and white fur, has one blue eye and one brown eye. Initially, the dog's head is tilted back, with its mouth open wide, revealing its pink tongue and white teeth, and facing the top of the frame. The dog catches a small object, then closes its mouth and quickly extends its tongue. The scene is set under bright, direct sunlight, with lush grass covering the ground and creating a simple, natural backdrop. In the blurred background, a small red object is faintly visible, accompanied by a bluish area that adds subtle contrast. The lighting is strong, casting soft shadows on the grass and illuminating the area. After catching the object, the dog lowers its head with its tongue extended. In the final frame, the dog looks directly at the camera with its mouth open. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down in a high-angle, static shot that becomes slightly unsteady towards the end. The video employs a speed ramp effect, and a shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the dog in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
