  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle, wide scenery shot where railway tracks on a brown gravel bed occupy the foreground, appearing to curve from the bottom right to the bottom left due to fisheye distortion. The camera is fixed, slightly unsteady, and positioned slightly above the tracks, capturing the scene with noticeable fisheye distortion that causes the railway tracks and the horizon to curve significantly. In the middle ground, poles supporting overhead catenary wires are positioned on the left and right sides of the tracks, with green fields stretching behind them towards a line of low hills in the background. The sky fills the top half of the frame, featuring a blue expanse with scattered white clouds. A white high-speed train with three prominent blue horizontal stripes along its length and dark, elongated windows enters the frame from the right middle ground, moving rapidly to the left. The train, with its rounded, aerodynamic front, travels along the track from right to left, passing close to the camera and briefly filling the view as it approaches the center, transitioning to a full shot that fills the entire horizontal width of the frame. The track appears curved due to the fisheye lens effect, but it is straight in reality. As the train continues its motion, it exits on the left, returning the scene to its initial static composition. The deep focus keeps the entire landscape, from the gravel in the immediate foreground to the distant hills, in sharp detail throughout the sequence.",

A deep focus keeps the entire landscape, from the gravel in the immediate foreground to the distant hills, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "The video initially shows a railway track with a brown gravel bed, multiple parallel steel rails, and overhead catenary wires. A white high-speed train with three prominent blue horizontal stripes along its length and dark, elongated windows then enters from the right. The train has a rounded, aerodynamic front and briefly fills the view as it passes.",
    "Motion": "A white high-speed train enters the frame from the right and travels rapidly along the track from right to left, passing close to the camera and briefly filling the view before exiting the frame. The track appears curved due to the fisheye lens effect, but it is straight in reality.",
    "Scene": "From a level perspective positioned beside the railway track, the scene captures a wide, rural landscape. The rusty brown tracks extend from right to left, with the middle section appearing to curve toward the viewer due to the fisheye lens effect. Poles supporting overhead catenary wires flank the tracks. In the distance, green fields stretch towards a line of low hills under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A modern, white high-speed train with blue horizontal stripes enters the scene from the right, speeding past the camera in a blur of motion before disappearing off-screen to the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
