  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene landscape during sunset, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field, and moves smoothly to the left without any shaking. Initially, a prominent tree trunk is positioned on the left side of the frame, but as the camera moves, the trunk shifts from left to right and eventually exits the frame. The tree canopy remains visible, occupying the upper portion of the frame throughout. In the middle ground, a grassy field stretches horizontally, leading towards the horizon in the background. A few scattered trees are visible on the grassy field in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The sun is near the horizon, located slightly off-center to the left, casting warm light across the scene. The video begins with a view of a large tree in the foreground, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the landscape. As the camera trucks left, the trunk of the tree gradually moves out of the frame, while the canopy remains visible. The sunlight continues to illuminate the scene, creating a serene and picturesque atmosphere. The camera continues to truck left, eventually centering on the open field and the distant trees, with the trunk of the tree now mostly out of view. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is painted with warm hues as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the sun's rays filtering through the tree branches, creating a picturesque view.",

    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene landscape during sunset. The camera continuously moves to the left, capturing the expansive scenery. Initially, a prominent tree trunk is positioned on the left side of the frame, but as the camera moves, the trunk shifts from left to right and eventually exits the frame. The tree canopy remains visible, occupying the upper portion of the frame throughout. In the middle ground, a grassy field stretches horizontally, leading towards the horizon in the background. A few scattered trees are visible on the grassy field in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
