  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a clear, focused medium shot of a woman with medium-length dark hair, glasses, and a light brown skin tone, wearing a yellow patterned top, positioned in the center of the frame, with her plate of food and iced tea also visible. The camera, at eye level with a level angle, smoothly pans right at a quick speed, creating a motion-blurred transition that moves past a man with glasses in a maroon shirt, also holding chopsticks. As the camera continues to move, it shows another woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a black top, holding chopsticks. The shot resolves into a stable medium shot centered on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, who is now in the middle ground. Her name tag reads \"Susan,\" and she has a light brown skin tone, holding chopsticks in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea occupies the left foreground, with a plate of food in front of her. The background features a dimly lit restaurant with traditional decor, including dark wooden elements, a large painting on the wall, a hanging lantern, and a refined, opulent ceiling featuring a delicate chandelier. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. Each individual at the table has a plate of noodles and vegetables, suggesting a calm, focused dining experience. The transitions between individuals occur smoothly, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus, with the restaurant's decor and table setting providing a cohesive backdrop. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subjects' level, maintaining steadiness and highlighting the warm, subdued ambiance of the setting.",

Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
