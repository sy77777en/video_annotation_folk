  "merged_caption": "The video shows a digital map with a red text \"TITANIC WRECK\" at the top center, above a glowing red circular target slightly to the right. Beneath the target, a white box displays the coordinates \"41°43'32\"N, 49°56'49\"W\". At the bottom left, a white compass-like icon is visible, featuring a diamond shape that is white on the top and black on the bottom. A glowing red dashed line animates to trace a large, irregular shape in the center. As this outline forms, a large, glowing white silhouette appears within it, becoming more visible while other elements remain static. The red circle marking the location pulses steadily. With very smooth motion, the camera moves backward, revealing more of the digital navigation interface that shows the location of the Titanic wreck, providing a broader view of the surrounding area. As the camera moves back, an object made of multiple glowing white lines near the coordinates gradually disappears.",

    "Subject": "A digital map is displayed with a dark, textured background and a white grid overlay. A red, glowing circle with a central dot pinpoints a location labeled \"TITANIC WRECK\" in red text. Below this, a white box contains the coordinates \"41°43'32\"N, 49°56'49\"W\". A red, glowing, dashed line outlines a large, irregular area, within which a faint, glowing white silhouette appears. A circular compass icon is visible in the lower-left corner, featuring a diamond shape that is white on the top and black on the bottom.",
    "Motion": "On a digital map, a red, glowing, dashed line animates to trace an irregular shape. As the line forms, a faint, glowing white silhouette materializes within the outlined area, while a red circle marking the location pulses steadily. The camera then moves back to offer a wider perspective of the surrounding area, providing a broader view.",
    "Scene": "A digital map with a dark, textured background is overlaid with a white grid. A red, glowing circular target marks a location identified by a red text overlay reading \"TITANIC WRECK.\" Below this, a white text overlay displays the coordinates \"41°43'32\"N, 49°56'49\"W.\" In the bottom-left corner, a white compass-like icon is present. A glowing, red, dashed line animates to trace the outline of a large, white, glowing silhouette that appears on the display.",
    "Spatial": "The video shows a digital map with a red text \"TITANIC WRECK\" at the top center, above a glowing red circular target slightly to the right. Beneath the target, a white box displays the coordinates \"41°43'35\" N, 49°56'54\" W\". At the bottom left, a white compass-like icon is visible. The camera slowly moves backward, revealing an object made of multiple glowing white lines near the coordinates, which gradually disappears. A glowing red dashed line animates to trace a large, irregular shape in the center. As this outline forms, a large, glowing white silhouette appears within it, becoming more visible while other elements remain static."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
