  "merged_caption": "Initially, the frame shows a pilot from the shoulders up, positioned in the left and center middle ground, looking towards the camera. He is in a pilot's uniform with a white shirt and black epaulets with gold stripes, smiling and facing the camera. He has light skin and gray hair. To his right, also in the middle ground, is an image of an aircraft cockpit with intricate controls and dials characterized by their metallic and textured surfaces. Text and a food image occupy the top right background, while desk items are visible in the bottom left middle ground and background. The video begins with a slow zoom out from the captain, then quickly moves downward and zooms out further to shift focus to the airplane on the leaflet. This movement reveals a large illustration of a KLM airplane occupying the entire bottom foreground, stretching from left to right, predominantly teal with a white underbelly, displaying the KLM logo and the text \"The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.\" The pilot and cockpit remain visible in the upper left-center and upper right-center middle ground, respectively, now smaller within the overall composition. The desk items shift to the upper left, and the background elements in the top right remain partially visible. The scene creatively blends elements of aviation and advertising, with the pilot and the aircraft as central subjects. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, creating a cohesive and visually striking advertisement reminiscent of a magazine page. The background includes a blurred image of an airport terminal, enhancing the indoor aviation-themed setting. The final frames fully integrate the airplane image with the pilot, emphasizing its sleek design and distinctive blue and white color scheme, underscoring the airline's branding and imagery.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a slow zoom out from the captain, then quickly moves downward and zooms out further to shift focus to the airplane on the leaflet. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a digitally crafted composition resembling a magazine layout, featuring a man in a pilot's uniform with a white shirt and black epaulets with gold stripes, smiling and facing the camera. He has light skin and gray hair, and is positioned near an aircraft cockpit with visible dials and controls. Adjacent to him is an artfully integrated image of a large airplane, predominantly teal with a white underbelly, displaying the KLM logo and the text \"The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.\" The scene creatively blends elements of aviation and advertising, with the pilot and the aircraft as central subjects.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a man in a pilot's uniform, smiling and looking directly at the camera. The background includes a blurred image of an airport terminal and a detailed view of an aircraft cockpit with various instruments and controls. The camera begins with a slow zoom out from the captain, then quickly moves downward and zooms out further to shift focus to the airplane on the leaflet, revealing the KLM logo and the text 'The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.' The final frames fully integrate the airplane image with the pilot, creating a cohesive and visually striking advertisement reminiscent of a magazine page.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases an indoor aviation-themed setting, beginning with a close-up of a pilot in uniform. It smoothly transitions to a detailed view of the cockpit's intricate controls and dials, characterized by their metallic and textured surfaces. The scene then highlights a KLM airplane illustration in front of the pilot, emphasizing its sleek design and distinctive blue and white color scheme. The background features a blend of images and text, creating a cohesive and engaging composition that underscores the airline's branding and imagery.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, the frame shows a pilot from the shoulders up, positioned in the left and center middle ground, looking towards the camera.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
