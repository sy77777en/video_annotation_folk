  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot, showcasing a distant cityscape under a uniformly grey and overcast sky in the background and a large, dark, and damp stone parapet in the foreground. A bicycle wheel with a green and white stripe on the rims appears from the bottom right, followed by a man wearing a red t-shirt, black pants, black and red gloves, and a blue, white, and yellow helmet, riding an orange bicycle onto the top of the parapet, moving toward the center of the frame. The camera, initially at the subject's height on the railing, smoothly pedestals up from hip level to eye level, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the stone platform in the foreground and the city in the background clear. The man jumps his bicycle onto the wide stone railing and performs a stunt by rotating clockwise halfway. As he leaps off the railing, executing a half clockwise rotation in the air, the camera gradually ascends to reveal the steep, green grassy slope below. The man appears mid-air as he moves to the center of the frame before landing on the grassy slope, now positioned at the bottom center below the camera. As he descends the slope, the camera's perspective shifts to a high-angle view, looking down on the subject, who becomes smaller in the frame as he moves down the slope. The sprawling city remains visible from this high vantage point, with the ancient-looking stone wall overlooking the grassy embankment that descends to a lower elevation, and the dense collection of buildings situated next to a green area with trees in the background.",

    "Scene": "From a high vantage point atop a wide, wet stone parapet, a sprawling city is visible under a uniformly grey and overcast sky. The ancient-looking stone wall in the foreground is dark and damp, overlooking a steep, green grassy embankment that descends to a lower elevation. The city in the background is a dense collection of buildings situated next to a green area with trees. A person on an orange bicycle with green-rimmed wheels rides along the top of the stone wall before descending the grassy slope.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
