  "merged_caption": "This video is a landscape scenery shot, opening with a low-angle wide shot focused on the expansive blue sky, which occupies most of the frame. The sky is vast and open, filled with scattered white clouds, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale. The snow-covered dome of a yurt is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera, positioned at eye level with a wide-angle lens, begins with a low angle looking up at the sky before transitioning to a level angle as it tilts down. As the camera tilts downward and pans right, the top of a snow-covered yurt starts to appear at the bottom of the frame. This movement reveals a broad, snowy landscape, with half of the yurt in the left foreground and other yurts appearing in the middle ground. The setting is a snowy landscape featuring several yurts, which are round, tent-like structures with white coverings. A car partially buried in snow is positioned in the middle ground, and a line of bare trees stretches across the background, adding a natural border to the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky displays a mix of blue and soft, warm hues from the setting sun. The camera continues to pan right, revealing a wide view of the snowy area with multiple yurt-like structures and the car. The shot concludes as a stable wide shot, with the sky in the upper half of the frame and the snowy yurt camp filling the lower half, captured at the yurts' height. The deep focus maintains clarity across the entire scene, creating a sense of openness and tranquility, with the snow reflecting the subtle colors of the sky.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor winter scene with a vast, open blue sky with some clouds. The setting is a snowy landscape featuring several yurts, which are round, tent-like structures with white coverings. Snow blankets the ground, creating a pristine, undisturbed surface. In the background, a line of bare trees stands against the horizon, adding a natural border to the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky displays a mix of blue and soft, warm hues from the setting sun.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
