  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the view peeks out from behind a dark structure with a slatted window, as if through the character’s eyes in a video game. The camera, positioned at eye level, pans left, revealing a military vehicle moving from right to left in the middle ground. The player's weapon, a black assault rifle held with gray and black protective gloves, remains in the bottom right-center foreground. As the camera continues to pan left, the dark structure moves off-screen to the right, and a soldier in green and brown camouflage lying on the dusty ground comes into view in the center. This movement reveals a two-story, beige concrete building with a flat roof and an external metal staircase, now occupying the left and center middle ground. Sparse green trees and shrubs are scattered across the arid, dirt-covered ground, enhancing the sunlit, dusty outdoor area during the daytime. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and moves slightly backward while occasionally panning right and left, before finally panning left again to reveal the building and the fallen character. The movement is quick and slightly unsteady, characteristic of mouse control. Throughout the shot, a video game heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid on the scene, showing a blue minimap in the bottom-left corner and blue-and-white indicators for ammunition and health status in the bottom-right.",

    "Camera": "This first-person video is filmed from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera, representing the player's view, initially pans left to follow a vehicle, then moves slightly backward while occasionally panning right and left, before finally panning left again to reveal a building and a fallen character. The movement is quick and slightly unsteady, characteristic of mouse control.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective in a video game, a player holds a black assault rifle, their left hand equipped with gray and black protective gloves. From this viewpoint, the player initially sees another soldier. As the camera moves and pans mainly to the left, a dark, open-frame military vehicle comes into view, followed by a soldier in green and brown camouflage lying on the dusty ground in front of a two-story, light-colored building. The view is overlaid with a heads-up display, which includes a blue minimap in the bottom-left corner and blue-and-white indicators for ammunition and health in the bottom-right.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the view peeks out from behind a dark, slatted object. The camera then pans to the left, moving past a military vehicle and revealing a two-story building. As the pan continues, a soldier lying on the ground comes into view before the camera movement ceases.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a sunlit, dusty outdoor area during the daytime. The setting features a two-story, beige concrete building with a flat roof and an external metal staircase. Sparse green trees and shrubs are scattered across the arid, dirt-covered ground. The view peeks out from behind a dark structure with a slatted window. The camera then pans and moves primarily to the left, passing a military vehicle and revealing the two-story building. A soldier lying on the ground in front of the building comes into view. A video game heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid on the scene, showing a minimap in the bottom-left corner and information such as ammunition count and health status in the bottom-right.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, the view peeks out from behind a dark structure with a slatted window. As the camera pans left, the perspective shifts to see a military vehicle moving from right to left in the middle ground. The camera then pans left, causing the dark structure to move off-screen to the right and a soldier lying on the ground before it in the center. This movement reveals a two-story building that now occupies the left and center middle ground. The player's weapon remains in the bottom right-center foreground. Throughout the shot, a minimap remains in the bottom-left corner and other interface elements are in the bottom-right as overlay elements. The camera is positioned at the character's eye level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
