  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot at the players' level, positioning the main action in the foreground. A Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the white number 3 is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball with his right hand. He wears black shorts with a red stripe and black leggings. The shooter is positioned in the center-right portion of the frame, with three opposing players in white \"SIXERS\" jerseys surrounding him on the left and right, attempting to block the shot. One player, with his arm raised high, wears a jersey with a partially visible red number. To his right, another player in a jersey with the red number 11 also jumps to block. A third player, wearing the number 12 in red, stands directly beside the shooter. Another player in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the number 50 stands on the far left, watching the play. The stadium audience is visible in the background. The camera, captured from a low, hip-level angle with a shallow depth of field, performs a smooth, slight pan to the left, then tilts upward and zooms in, following the basketball's upward arc. The shot transitions to a low-angle wide shot of the basketball from below the basket, where the hoop and net are centered in the foreground. The basketball travels in an arc toward the basket, which consists of an orange rim and a white net attached to a transparent backboard mounted on a red and blue support structure featuring the text \"NBA TV\" in white and the official NBA logo. The ball remains in the frame throughout, descending and passing cleanly through the net, with the backboard's support structure visible in the top-left foreground.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a low, hip-level angle, utilizing a shallow depth of field that keeps the basketball players in the foreground sharp. The camera performs a smooth, slight pan to the left, then tilts up to track the basketball's trajectory. As the ball nears the basket, the camera zooms in to emphasize it going through the hoop.",
    "Subject": "In a basketball game, a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the white number 3 is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball with his right hand. He wears black shorts with a red stripe and black leggings. Attempting to block the shot are three opposing players in white \"SIXERS\" jerseys with white shorts featuring blue stripes. One player, with his arm raised high, wears a jersey with a partially visible red number. To his right, another player in a jersey with the red number 11 also jumps to block. A third player, wearing the number 12 in red, stands directly beside the shooter. Other players, including a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the number 50, watch the play. The camera follows the orange basketball as it arcs toward the hoop and falls through the white net of the basket, which is attached to a blue and red support structure.",
    "Motion": "A basketball player in a black jersey jumps and releases a shot with his right hand as three opposing players in white jerseys leap to block him. The camera follows the basketball as it travels in an upward arc, descends, and passes through the hoop and net.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a large, indoor basketball arena filled with spectators in tiered seating that surrounds a polished wooden court. A basketball player in a black and red uniform is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball. Several opposing players in white and blue uniforms are attempting to block the shot. The ball travels in an arc toward the basket, which consists of an orange rim and a white net. The hoop is attached to a transparent backboard, which is mounted on a red and blue support structure featuring the text \"NBA TV\" in white and the official NBA logo. The ball is shown passing cleanly through the net.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
