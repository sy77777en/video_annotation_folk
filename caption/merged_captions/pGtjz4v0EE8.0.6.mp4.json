  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in a wide shot from a level-angle perspective, positioned at eye level. Initially, the polished, checkered floor occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the background. The walls, lined with large, dramatic paintings in dark, gilded frames above rich wood paneling, are on the left and right sides of the frame, while the ornate, coffered ceiling adorned with a central fresco is at the top. In the center background, an elaborate white marble altar featuring a central statue is visible, with a black grand piano to its left and a wooden bench in front of it. The camera, positioned at eye level, smoothly dollies forward through the space, gliding across the floor. This forward dolly shot causes the altar and piano in the background to become larger and more detailed as they transition towards the middle ground, while the camera maintains its level height throughout the movement. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire interior in sharp detail, while the checkered floor extends seamlessly from the foreground to the background, enhancing the depth and continuity of the scene, leading to the elaborate altar at the far end. Light enters through several windows, supplementing the interior illumination. The lens creates mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, using a wide-angle perspective to emphasize the immense scale, rich detail, and solemn atmosphere of the architectural space. The scene is beautifully completed by the ornate, frescoed, and gilded ceiling, creating a harmonious and majestic atmosphere, likely in a European palace or museum.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a grand, ornate hall, shot with a lens that creates mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera, positioned at an eye-level and level angle, smoothly dollies forward through the space. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire interior in sharp detail, while the checkered floor extends seamlessly from the foreground to the background, enhancing the depth and continuity of the scene, leading to the elaborate altar at the far end.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing the opulent interior of a grand, baroque-style hall. The camera glides smoothly over a highly polished, checkered marble floor that reflects the ornate surroundings. The walls are adorned with large, dramatic paintings in dark, gilded frames, set above rich wood paneling, while a lavishly decorated ceiling with a central fresco adds to the sense of grandeur. At the far end of the long hall stands an elaborate white marble altar featuring a central statue. There is no single main subject in this video; the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, using a wide-angle perspective to emphasize the immense scale, rich detail, and solemn atmosphere of the architectural space.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a grand and opulent hall, likely in a European palace or museum, from a level-angle perspective. The wide view showcases the elegant space, with its large, dramatic paintings adorning the walls above dark wood paneling. The scene is beautifully completed by an ornate, frescoed, and gilded ceiling, creating a harmonious and majestic atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A forward movement captures the interior of a grand, opulent hall with a highly polished, patterned marble floor that reflects the surroundings. The lower walls are lined with dark wood paneling, while the upper sections feature large, framed oil paintings. The ornate, coffered ceiling is adorned with a central fresco. At the far end of the long room stands an elaborate marble altar with a central statue. To the left of the altar is a black grand piano, and a wooden bench sits in front of it. Light enters through several windows, supplementing the interior illumination.",

The walls, lined with large paintings, are on the left and right sides of the frame, while the ornate ceiling is at the top. In the center background, an elaborate altar is visible, with a grand piano to its left. The camera then moves steadily forward, gliding smoothly across the floor.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
