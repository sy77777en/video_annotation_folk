  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot at night, a person wearing a light blue hooded jacket and dark pants stands in the lower three-quarters of the middle ground on a wooden deck, positioned next to a brightly lit house on their right. The house is located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, while a single-story house with dark windows is centrally aligned in the lower two-thirds of the background. The foreground at the bottom of the frame features the yard outside the house. The background is filled with a vibrant green aurora borealis that occupies the upper half of the sky, partially obscured by dark clouds. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a level angle, eye-level shot with deep focus that keeps the house and the aurora-filled sky in sharp detail. Initially, the person looks to the left and moves slightly in that direction, with subtle movements of their body and arms. The camera moves smoothly from right to left with minimal shaking, as the person turns to gaze up at the sky, where the green aurora is visible. An overlay at the top of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Sadly clouds had formed and they were blocking the show 😩\".",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a light blue hooded jacket and dark pants stands on a wooden deck at night, near the door of a brightly illuminated building. They have turned their head from looking to the left and are now gazing up at the sky, where a green aurora is visible.",
    "Motion": "A person stands on a wooden deck, initially looking to the left and moving slightly in that direction, with subtle movements of their body and arms, before turning to gaze up at the sky.",
    "Scene": "At night, a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminates the dark sky above a rural landscape. Dark clouds are scattered across the sky, partially obscuring the light show. In the middle ground, a person wearing a turquoise hooded jacket stands on a wooden deck attached to a structure with a bright exterior light. A modern, single-story house with lit windows is also situated in the middle ground, while a house with dark windows is visible in the background. An overlay at the top of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Sadly clouds had formed and they were blocking the show 😩\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
