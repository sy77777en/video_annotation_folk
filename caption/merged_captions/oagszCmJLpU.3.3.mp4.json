  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured in a time-lapse video that greatly accelerates the movement of the storm clouds across the sky. The bottom portion of the frame is occupied by a flat, grassy prairie that extends from the foreground to the background horizon. The rest of the frame is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm cloud system in the middle ground and background. The dark, layered base of the storm cloud sits in the middle of the frame, with lighter, swirling clouds above it. A curtain of rain is visible in both the background and the middle ground, primarily in the center and right portions of the scene. On the left horizon, a small patch of sunlight breaks through in the background. In this time-lapse, the entire cloud formation swirls and moves across the sky, with the lower, darker sections showing the most prominent motion. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky, and performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left. The sky is filled with dramatic, swirling clouds in shades of dark gray, teal, and deep blue, forming a menacing, layered structure. Sheets of rain are visible falling in the distance, partially obscuring a sliver of golden light on the far horizon. The massive storm clouds, characteristic of a supercell, are shown swirling and advancing rapidly across the landscape. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the grassy field to the clouds, sharp. The focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the expansive, grassy landscape below.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video, greatly accelerating the movement of the storm clouds across the sky. The shot is captured from a low angle, with the camera positioned somewhere between eye and overhead level. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the grassy field to the clouds, sharp. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a vast, flat prairie. The sky is dominated by a swirling, layered supercell cloud, with dark, ominous gray and teal tones contrasting with brighter white sections above. Sheets of rain are visible falling in the distance, partially obscuring a sliver of golden light on the far horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the expansive, grassy landscape below.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a massive storm system. The scene features turbulent storm clouds, characteristic of a supercell, moving over a vast, flat, grassy plain. The massive storm clouds are shown swirling and advancing rapidly across the landscape.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a vast, flat grassland. The sky is filled with dramatic, swirling clouds in shades of dark gray, teal, and deep blue, forming a menacing, layered structure. A grey curtain of rain is visible falling in the distance. Below, the green and yellow prairie stretches to the horizon, where a patch of bright, golden sunlight breaks through a gap in the clouds, creating a stark contrast with the dark, ominous weather.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
