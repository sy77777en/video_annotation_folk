  "merged_caption": "The video employs a medium close-up shot, with a man positioned in the right mid-ground, looking towards his right front, which is towards the woman in the left foreground. A woman, seen primarily from her back, occupies the left foreground, facing the man. The man wears a dark-colored beanie, a dark green tactical jacket, and a tactical vest with \"G-25\" printed on it. He has a prominent dark brown mustache and beard, and light skin. He is holding a rifle and subtly nods his head, with his facial expression shifting slightly as he speaks. The woman, with blonde hair styled in a neat bun and wearing a light-colored, possibly white or very light grey, collared shirt or jacket, remains still. In the dimly lit background, several out-of-focus figures in military-style attire are visible, distributed across the center and left, with indistinct vehicles. The scene is set outdoors at night in a moderately lit, open area. Green and white subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the frame, displaying dialogue with names in green and text in white: \"Price: To who?\", \"Laswell: Russia.\", and \"Price: Prisoner swap?\". The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, at eye level with a level angle, and uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The overall atmosphere is dark, with focused lighting on the two main characters.",

    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character with blonde hair in a bun and a light-colored shirt, looks towards another character. The scene is set outdoors at night in a moderately lit, open area, with indistinct vehicles and figures in the background. The character facing the camera is a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a tactical vest with \"G-25\" printed on it. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom, displaying dialogue with names in green and text in white: \"Price: To who?\", \"Laswell: Russia.\", and \"Price: Prisoner swap?\".

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
