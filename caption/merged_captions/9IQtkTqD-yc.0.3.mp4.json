  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, scenic shot from a forward-moving perspective up a narrow, unpaved road at night, viewed through a circular frame with a black border. The entire scene is rendered in a grainy, monochromatic green due to the night vision device. Initially, the road is positioned in the center, extending from the bottom foreground into the dark background. Three bright pools of light illuminate the path in the bottom center, the left, and the top right foreground, emphasizing the road's uneven surface and catching small, reflective specks floating in the air. Dense woods line both the left and right sides of the frame, creating a tunnel-like effect as the viewpoint advances into the darkness. The camera, mounted on the front of a vehicle, moves unsteadily forward, maintaining a level angle and using a deep focus to keep the entire scene relatively sharp. As the video progresses, the right side of the tree wall opens up into an open area, revealing a field in the middle ground and background, while the dense woods on the left remain in their position. The focus is on capturing the isolated and eerie atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the emphasis is on the scenery and the dynamics of the forward-moving perspective.",

    "Camera": "This is an unsteady, eye-level shot from a camera mounted on the front of a vehicle, moving forward along a dark, wooded road. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a scenery shot of a vehicle traveling up a narrow, wooded road at night, viewed through a night-vision lens that casts a grainy, monochromatic green glow over the landscape. A single beam of light illuminates the rough, unpaved path ahead, which is lined on both sides by dense, dark woods with bare trees. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on capturing the isolated and eerie atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot captured through a night vision device, giving the footage a green, grainy appearance. The camera moves unsteadily forward up a narrow, dark road. The path is flanked by trees and illuminated by a light source, likely from a vehicle.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a forward-moving perspective down a narrow, unpaved road at night, as seen through a night vision device. The entire scene is rendered in a grainy, monochromatic green and is contained within a circular frame with a black border. Three bright, circular pools of light illuminate the road directly ahead and both sides of the tree-lined walls, emphasizing the road's uneven surface and catching small, reflective specks floating in the air. Initially, dense trees and foliage on either side appear as pale, ghostly forms, creating a tunnel-like effect as the viewpoint advances into the darkness. As the video progresses, the right side of the tree wall opens up into an open area, adding depth and variation to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
