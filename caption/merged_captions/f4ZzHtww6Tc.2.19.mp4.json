  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a man with light skin and tattoos on both arms, wearing a forward-facing black baseball cap, a short-sleeved, light-colored shirt, and dark, baggy cuffed jeans. He is captured mid-air above a marble ledge in the right foreground, performing a trick with his dark skateboard. A building is visible in the left background. The fisheye lens creates noticeable curvature distortion, and the deep focus keeps the entire urban scene sharp. As the skateboarder lands back on the board on the sidewalk, the frame transitions to a medium shot, focusing on his lower body and skateboard in the center foreground. The camera follows his movement, tracking him as he skates away from the camera, moving from the sidewalk into the street. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder moves from the center foreground toward the right middle ground, riding down a street that stretches into the background. The camera pedestals upward to eye level, transitioning to a level angle. The final composition shows the wide street in the center, with buildings on the left, and a dark-colored van parked in the right middle ground. The setting is an outdoor urban scene during the day, with a city street lined with tall, modern buildings and green, leafy trees. The wide-angle lens creates a distorted, curved view of the architecture and the street stretching into the distance. The skateboarder, wearing black and white high-top sneakers, becomes smaller in the frame as he rides down the empty city street, completing the dynamic motion captured from the low, fisheye perspective.",

    "Camera": "This video is filmed with a fisheye lens, resulting in noticeable curvature distortion. The shot begins from an unsteady, low-angle, ground-level perspective, side-tracking a skateboarder. A deep focus keeps the entire urban scene sharp. As the skateboarder moves away, becoming smaller in the frame, the camera pedestals upward to eye level, transitioning to a level angle.",
    "Subject": "A man with light skin and tattoos on both arms is shown skateboarding. He wears a forward-facing black baseball cap, a short-sleeved, light-colored shirt, and dark, baggy cuffed jeans. On his feet are black and white high-top sneakers. He performs a trick, jumping with his dark skateboard onto a low ledge, and then lands back on the board on the pavement to ride away.",
    "Motion": "From a low, fisheye perspective, a skateboarder jumps off a low marble ledge, with the board momentarily separating from his feet in mid-air. He lands back on the board on the sidewalk and then skates away from the camera, moving from the sidewalk into the street. The camera follows his movement, tracking him as he rides down the empty city street.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, fisheye perspective captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. The setting is a city street lined with tall, modern buildings and green, leafy trees. One building features a large, polished marble or stone wall and ledge next to a concrete sidewalk. The camera follows a skateboarder from the sidewalk onto the asphalt street, where a dark-colored van is parked. The wide-angle lens creates a distorted, curved view of the architecture and the street stretching into the distance.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a skateboarder in the center foreground, captured mid-air above a marble ledge in the right foreground. A building is visible in the left background. As the skateboarder lands, the frame transitions to a medium shot, focusing on his lower body and skateboard in the center foreground. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder moves from the center foreground toward the right middle ground, riding down a street that stretches into the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
