  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a young boy with pale skin and short, dark hair is positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. He has large, dark eyes with prominent dark circles underneath, and his expression is characterized by furrowed brows and a slightly open mouth, maintaining a concerned, frowning facial expression. He is wearing a dark, plain shirt. The scene is set within a dark, indistinct interior, where the lighting is low and focused. A soft light source from the front illuminates the boy, casting the surrounding, out-of-focus background into darkness. The overall color palette is muted and desaturated, composed primarily of dark blues and grays. Dark, blurry objects in the immediate foreground partially frame the shot on the left and right edges. The camera remains static at the boy's eye level throughout the shot, using a shallow depth of field to keep the boy in sharp focus. The camera performs a very slow and smooth truck from right to left, enhancing the sense of depth and focus on the boy's slight movements.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a young boy in the midground in sharp focus. The camera performs a very slow and smooth truck from right to left.",
    "Subject": "A young boy with pale skin and short, dark hair is shown in a close-up. He has large, dark eyes with prominent dark circles underneath. His expression is characterized by furrowed brows and a slightly open mouth. He is wearing a dark, plain shirt.",
    "Motion": "The young boy shows slight movements throughout the video, maintaining a concerned, frowning facial expression.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, indistinct interior, where the lighting is low and focused. A soft light source from the front illuminates an animated boy with dark hair and a plain dark shirt, casting the surrounding, out-of-focus background into darkness. Dark, blurry objects in the immediate foreground partially frame the shot on the left and right edges. The overall color palette is muted and desaturated, composed primarily of dark blues and grays.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a young boy is positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. A dark, out-of-focus object in the immediate foreground frames the shot along the left and right  edges. The background is dark and indistinct. The camera remains static at the boy's eye level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
