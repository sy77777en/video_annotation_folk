  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot from a level angle, placing the main subject, a person with fair skin and blonde, shoulder-length hair in a bowl cut, wearing a dark blue, short-sleeved collared shirt and a watch on their right wrist, in the center-left foreground as they lean over another person with dark skin in a blue t-shirt in the center middle ground. Both individuals have their hands resting on each other's shoulders as a large volume of white and multicolored confetti is thrown or falls onto them from above. To the right, a third individual with dark hair in a white graphic t-shirt and dark patterned pants occupies the middle ground, raising their arms energetically. Additional figures are visible in both the middle ground and the background, all moving energetically in a celebratory manner. The camera, initially at a hip-level, level angle, cranes upward in an arc with noticeable shaking, transitioning to an eye-level, bird's-eye view of the scene. This shift reveals a black and white checkered floor below, with the group clustered in the center of the frame. The main subject's back is now toward the camera as confetti continues to shower over them, accumulating on their heads and the floor. The scene is illuminated with warm, slightly greenish lighting, creating a vintage film aesthetic. The entire video is presented within a black letterbox frame, with vignette overlays in the four corners. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire frame sharp, as the camera captures the celebratory moment from above, emphasizing the dynamic and festive atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins at a hip-level, level angle on a group of people celebrating. The camera then cranes up in an arc with noticeable shaking, transitioning to an eye-level, bird's-eye view of the scene. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire frame sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of this grainy, low-fidelity video is a person with fair skin and blonde, shoulder-length hair in a bowl cut, wearing a dark blue, short-sleeved collared shirt and a watch on their right wrist. This individual is the central focus, leaning forward with their hands resting on the shoulders of a person with dark skin in a blue t-shirt, as they are both showered with a large amount of white and colored confetti. Surrounding them are several other people participating in the celebration. To the right, a person with dark hair in a white graphic t-shirt and dark patterned pants raises their arms. Other less distinct figures are visible in the background, all clustered together in a celebratory moment.",
    "Motion": "A person with blonde hair leans over another individual, both with their hands resting on each other's shoulders, as a large volume of confetti is thrown or falls onto them from above. Simultaneously, a person to the right raises their arms, and other surrounding people move energetically in a celebratory manner. The confetti continuously showers the group, accumulating on their heads and the checkered floor below.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene shifts from a level-angle perspective to a bird's eye view, looking down upon a black and white checkered floor. A shower of white and multicolored confetti continuously falls from above, blanketing the floor and the several people gathered in the room. The scene is illuminated with warm, slightly greenish lighting, creating a vintage film aesthetic. The entire video is presented within a black letterbox frame, with vignette overlays in the four corners.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium full shot from a level angle, placing the main subject in the center-left foreground as they lean over another person in the center middle ground. To the right, a third individual occupies the middle ground, with additional figures visible in both the middle ground and the background. The camera then cranes upward in an arc, shifting the perspective to a bird's eye angle full shot that looks down on the scene. In this final framing, the group is clustered in the center of the frame on the black and white checkered floor, with the main subject's back now toward the camera as confetti falls over them from above."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
