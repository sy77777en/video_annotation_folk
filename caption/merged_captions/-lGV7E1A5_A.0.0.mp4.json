  "merged_caption": "The video is captured from a first-person perspective, with the rider's helmet brim, featuring a red and white Red Bull logo, occupying the bottom center of the frame in the immediate foreground. The rider's hands, covered in white and black gloves, occasionally appear gripping the black handlebars. A blue track extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, creating a central leading line. Spectators in casual attire are positioned in the middle ground along the left and right sides of the frame, behind white and orange barriers, respectively. In the middle ground, a tall, dark take-off ramp is centered, with a large blue quarter-pipe ramp with Red Bull branding to its left. The Chicago skyline fills the background across the top of the frame under a cloudy sky. The camera, positioned at the rider's eye level, exhibits mild barrel distortion and is tilted, with the Dutch angle varying due to rolling. Initially static, the camera shakes intensely and then moves forward as the motorcycle accelerates along the straight blue track, maintaining its course. The unsteady shaking persists throughout the movement, causing the ramps and crowds to increase in size. As the rider nears the end of the track, the central take-off ramp remains in the middle of the frame, with the quarter-pipe on the left becoming more prominent. The front wheel of the motorcycle, featuring orange details, is visible as the camera moves forward. Large video screens are present, enhancing the immersive experience. The event takes place in an outdoor park setting, with the Chicago skyline and its prominent skyscrapers visible in the background, adding to the dynamic and engaging atmosphere of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This point-of-view shot, filmed from a driver's head-mounted camera, exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at a high, eye-level angle and is tilted, with the Dutch angle varying due to rolling. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. Initially, the camera is static but shakes intensely. It then moves forward along the blue track, with the unsteady shaking persisting throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "This video is shot from the first-person perspective of a motorcyclist. At the bottom of the frame, the rider's hands, covered in white and black gloves, are occasionally visible gripping the black handlebars. The brim of the helmet, which is gray and black with a logo in red and white letters, briefly appears as the rider moves. The front wheel of the motorcycle features orange details. On both sides of the blue track, a large crowd of spectators in casual attire stands behind white and orange barriers, watching the event.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the motorcycle accelerates forward along a straight blue track, maintaining its course throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a perspective moving down a long, blue-surfaced track in an outdoor park setting. The event takes place during the day under a cloudy sky, with the Chicago skyline and its prominent skyscrapers visible in the background. Crowds of spectators stand behind white and orange barriers lining the grassy areas on both sides of the track. In the distance, a tall, dark-colored take-off ramp is centered at the end of the path, while a large blue quarter-pipe ramp with Red Bull branding stands to the left. Large video screens are also present. A red and white Red Bull logo is visible on the brim of the helmet, adding to the immersive experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
