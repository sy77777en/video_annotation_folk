  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man with a medium-dark skin tone, a buzz cut, and a short beard, seated in the back seat on the left side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground with the camera at his eye level. He is wearing a light-colored shirt or jacket and initially glances to the left side of the frame. The scene is set inside a dimly lit vehicle, likely at night, with rain droplets visible on the windshield, creating a speckled texture across the glass. The environment is enclosed, with metal grating situated between the front and back seats in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the back seat before smoothly transitioning to the driver. The driver, with a lighter skin tone, a thick brown beard, and wearing a dark knit cap and jacket, is positioned on the right side of the frame in the front seat. He takes a drag from his cigarette, places his left hand on the steering wheel, and begins to speak. The rain-covered windshield and wipers dominate the foreground, occupying the entire image. The lighting is low and muted, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the subdued atmosphere. Subtitles appear near the bottom center of the frame, displaying the text: \"Kyle: Boss...\" and \"Kyle: What the hell are we doing here?\" followed by “Price: We’re cleaning up a mess.” The camera remains smooth and steady, with only minor, unintentional movement, maintaining a consistent height relative to each subject. The overall scene is quiet and still, with the rain and reflections contributing to a somber, enclosed setting.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man with a buzz cut in the back seat, and then smoothly transitioning to the man wearing a hat on the right side of the front seat. The background and foreground remain blurred, and the camera remains very smooth and steady, with only minor, unintentional movement and no noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a focus on a man with a medium-dark skin tone, a buzz cut, and a short beard, seated in the back seat. He is wearing a light-colored shirt or jacket and is gazing at the man in the driver's seat. The camera then shifts to the driver, who has a lighter skin tone, a thick brown beard, and is wearing a dark knit cap and a dark jacket. He is smoking, with his left hand on the steering wheel, and looking forward. The video highlights the distinct appearances of the two men, with the focus primarily on the driver.",
    "Motion": "The man in the back seat initially glances to the left side of the frame and, after speaking, turns to face the driver. Meanwhile, the driver takes a drag from his cigarette, places the left hand holding the cigarette on the steering wheel, and then begins to speak.",
    "Scene": "The video offers a perspective from outside the car, viewed through the windshield, showing the interior. The scene takes place inside a dimly lit vehicle, likely at night, with rain droplets visible on the window, creating a speckled texture across the glass. The environment is enclosed, with metal grating and dark, utilitarian surfaces forming the backdrop. Two individuals are seated inside the car: the person on the left is in the back seat, while the person on the right is in the front driver's seat. Both are dressed in dark, rugged clothing. The lighting is low and muted, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the subdued atmosphere. An overlay of green and white subtitles appears near the bottom center, displaying the text: \"Kyle: Boss...\" and \"Kyle: What the hell are we doing here?\" followed by “Price: We’re cleaning up a mess.” The overall scene is quiet and still, with the rain and reflections contributing to a somber, enclosed setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the man in the back seat, positioned on the left side of the frame and in the middle ground of the scene, with the camera at his eye level. The metal grating is situated between the front and back seats of the car in the middle ground. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up of the driver, who is now the main subject, positioned on the right side of the frame and also in the middle ground, with the camera again at his eye level. The rain-covered windshield and wipers dominate the foreground, occupying the entire image. Throughout the video, the spatial focus shifts from the back seat passenger on the left to the driver on the right, with each subject maintaining their respective positions on the left and right sides of the frame during their close-ups. The subtitles appear near the bottom center of the frame, overlaying the lower part of the scene. There is no significant movement of the subjects themselves, but the camera’s focus and framing shift smoothly from one subject to the other, maintaining a consistent height relative to each subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
