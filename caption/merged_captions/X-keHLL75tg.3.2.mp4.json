  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing two men and a horse in the foreground of a stable corridor. A man in a black short-sleeved shirt with short, dark, curly hair and a mustache is on the left, looking right, while a light-skinned man with long, dark brown hair, a small earring in his left ear, and wearing a white polo shirt is on the right, seen in profile looking left. A brown horse wearing a bridle stands between them in the center of the frame. The background includes more of the stable, with reddish-brown stalls with barred upper sections lining the passageway, ceiling lights extending into the distance, and other figures visible further away. The environment is illuminated by horizontal fluorescent light fixtures mounted on the ceiling, casting a warm, yellowish light throughout the space. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, uses a shallow depth of field to keep the men and the horse in the foreground sharp. The man in the white polo shirt turns his head from a profile view to face the camera, breaking into a wide, toothy smile. As he does so, the camera executes a very smooth, gradual zoom-in while simultaneously panning slightly to the right, transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final framing, he occupies the center-right of the frame, while the horse's head is positioned to his left in the middle ground, and the other man is now mostly out of view on the far left. The man in the black shirt and the horse remain largely stationary throughout the clip. A third individual, dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt, is positioned near the horse's head, holding a comb and gently running it through the tuft of hair on the horse's head.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the men and the horse in the foreground sharp. The camera executes a very smooth, gradual zoom-in while simultaneously panning slightly to the right, reframing the composition to focus on the man in the white shirt.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a light-skinned man with long, dark brown hair and a small earring in his left ear, wearing a white polo shirt. He is initially seen in profile speaking to another man before turning to face the camera with a wide, toothy smile. To his left stands another light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair and a mustache, dressed in a black short-sleeved shirt, maintaining a serious expression while looking at the first man. Positioned between them is a brown horse wearing a bridle, facing forward in a stable aisle. A third individual, dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt, has his hand raised near the horse's head.",
    "Motion": "A man in a white polo shirt turns his head from a profile view to face the camera, breaking into a wide smile. The man in the black shirt and the horse positioned between them remain largely stationary throughout the clip. A third person is holding a comb and gently running it through the tuft of hair on the horse's head.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a long, narrow stable corridor with a concrete floor. On both sides, reddish-brown stalls with barred upper sections line the passageway, creating a strong sense of perspective. The environment is illuminated by horizontal fluorescent light fixtures mounted on the ceiling, which cast a warm, yellowish light throughout the space. In the center of the aisle, a brown horse wearing a halter stands between two men. Other figures can be seen in the blurred background further down the corridor.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing two men and a horse in the foreground of a stable corridor. A man in a black shirt is on the left, looking right, while a man in a white polo shirt is on the right, seen in profile looking left. A brown horse stands between them in the center of the frame. The background includes more of the stable, with ceiling lights extending into the distance and other figures visible further away. The camera then smoothly zooms in as the man in the white shirt turns to face the camera directly, transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final framing, he occupies the center-right of the frame, while the horse's head is positioned to his left in the middle ground, and the other man is now mostly out of view on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
