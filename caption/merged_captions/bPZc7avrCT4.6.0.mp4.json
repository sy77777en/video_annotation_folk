  "merged_caption": "This video presents a close-up scenery shot focused on a dynamic event. A brown tree stump occupies the bottom-center foreground, with a green water balloon resting on it. The camera is positioned slightly above the tree stump, capturing the action head-on with a static, hip-level shot. As the video progresses, the green object on the stump explodes, sending a large spray of water that originates from the bottom center and expands to fill the middle of the frame, with the main splash moving toward the top right. The camera employs a speed ramp effect, transitioning from even slower motion to slow motion, maintaining a level angle and a shallow depth of field to keep the exploding water balloon in sharp focus. The water is captured mid-splash, creating a dynamic and slow-motion scene. The background is softly blurred, revealing a pile of cut logs on the left and indistinct green foliage occupying the upper and right portions of the scene, suggesting a natural, possibly wooded or garden, environment. The water droplets catch the light, creating a sparkling, energetic effect as they are suspended in the air, enveloping the stump. The focus is on the transient, forceful action of the water bursting and interacting with the natural elements, creating an atmosphere of sudden, chaotic energy within a rustic outdoor setting.",

    "Camera": "This static, hip-level shot uses a speed ramp effect, transitioning from even slower motion to slow motion. The camera maintains a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the exploding water balloon in the foreground in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dynamic outdoor scenery shot. The central visual event is a green object, likely a water balloon, exploding on a rough, brown tree stump, sending a dramatic spray of clear water outwards and upwards. The water droplets catch the light, creating a sparkling, energetic effect. The background is softly blurred, revealing a pile of cut logs and indistinct green foliage, suggesting a natural, possibly wooded or garden, environment. There is no single main subject in the traditional sense; instead, the focus is on the transient, forceful action of the water bursting and interacting with the natural elements, creating an atmosphere of sudden, chaotic energy within a rustic outdoor setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a speed-ramp, close-up shot of a green water balloon exploding on a tree stump, featuring a speed ramp effect. The water is captured mid-splash, creating a dynamic and slow-motion scene. The setting is outdoors with a blurred background of green foliage and a pile of cut logs.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit outdoor setting, a green balloon rests on a brown tree stump. As the balloon bursts, it creates a dramatic, slow-motion splash. Water droplets are suspended in the air, creating a large spray that envelops the stump. In the blurred background, a pile of cut logs and green foliage are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
