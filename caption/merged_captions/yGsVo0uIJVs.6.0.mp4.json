  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a view of the ocean, showing gentle waves across the entire frame, with no major subject visible, creating a wide shot of the scenery. The camera is positioned above the water, looking down. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, a large ship gradually enters the frame from the top left, initially with only a small part of the hull visible. The ship, featuring a dark hull and a lighter superstructure, becomes the main subject in a wide shot. It is positioned slightly left of center in the midground, with a prominent yellow derrick centrally located on the ship, slightly towards the bow. The ocean remains in the foreground, while the sky with clouds forms the background. The camera is at the ship's level when the subject is fully revealed. The camera starts at a high angle and swiftly moves forward toward the large ship, steadily tilting upward to a level-angle view. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is smooth. The ship, with its long, dark-colored hull and lighter-colored, multi-level superstructure, eventually appears slightly left of center in the midground. A prominent, tall, yellow, lattice-like derrick or crane structure is centrally located on the ship, slightly towards the bow. The ship is positioned on the vast expanse of the ocean under a hazy, overcast sky with some visible clouds. An overlay text \"[2]\" is visible in the far left corner of the frame, and as the video progresses, the overlay text \"1974\" appears in the bottom left corner, indicating the historical time period of the video.",

    "Subject": "The video starts with a view looking down at a choppy, dark blue ocean surface. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, a large ship gradually comes into full view, initially appearing partially at the top left of the frame with just a small part of the hull visible. The ship, with its long, dark-colored hull and lighter-colored, multi-level superstructure, eventually appears slightly left of center in the midground.

    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of the ocean surface, showing gentle waves and a distant ship on the horizon. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, the ship becomes more visible, revealing its full structure, including a large derrick or crane. The year '1974' appears on the screen, indicating its historical context. The ship moves towards the left side of the frame and into the background as the camera gets closer, showing more details of its deck and equipment.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows a vast expanse of deep blue ocean under an overcast sky, with a mist over the distant sea creating a gloomy and gray background. The water has gentle, rolling waves. In the distance, a long, dark-hulled ship with a white superstructure and a prominent yellow drilling derrick on its deck appears to be moving slightly towards the left side of the frame, with its bow facing slightly to the left rear. An overlay text \"[2]\" is visible in the far left corner of the frame, and as the video progresses, the overlay text \"1974\" appears in the bottom left corner, indicating the historical time period of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
