  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, featuring a large hot air balloon with a classic teardrop shape positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, set against a background of a vast, snow-covered forest below. The balloon's envelope is brightly colored with vertical stripes of red, white, blue, and additional yellow stripes near the top. On a wide white section, the word \"PORSCHE\" is printed in a black, stylized font, and below this, a logo is visible, featuring \"-30°\" in a blue rectangle with a white figure and \"+30°\" in a red rectangle with a white figure. A small, light-colored basket hangs from the bottom of the envelope. The camera, positioned at a high angle above the subject, then moves forward and tilts downward, providing a closer view of the balloon's striped envelope as it floats steadily over the dense expanse of evergreen trees blanketed in white snow. This movement transitions into a top-down perspective, where the drone's perspective shifts, moving from a high-angle view to a position directly above the balloon, offering a close-up of its striped top as it glides over the wintery terrain. The smooth drone shot flies forward and rapidly closes in on the hot air balloon, keeping it in focus in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. This movement concludes with a close-up, where the top of the balloon's striped envelope fills most of the frame in the foreground, viewed directly from above.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a hot air balloon flying over a vast, snow-covered forest. The landscape below is a dense expanse of evergreen trees blanketed in white snow. The balloon itself is brightly colored with vertical stripes of red, white, blue, and yellow. The word \"PORSCHE\" is visible in black lettering on its side, along with a \"-30° + 30°\" graphic. The drone's perspective shifts, moving from a high-angle view to a position directly above the balloon, offering a close-up of its striped top as it glides over the wintery terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
