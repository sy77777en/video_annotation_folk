  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot from a ground-level, upside-down worm's-eye perspective, with the camera initially positioned below the subjects. In this initial framing, the soles of a child's brown boots are in the upper-center foreground, with their body extending toward the lower-center of the frame. An adult in a white shirt is positioned in the left middle ground, and another adult in a bright red long-sleeve shirt moves from the right middle ground to the foreground, both supporting the child. The child, with medium skin, curly brown hair, and wearing a green shirt, light-colored shorts, and red socks, is being held in the air by the two adults. A round table occupies the left foreground, and framed pictures are visible in the upper-center-right background. The entire perspective then shifts as the camera cranes upward in an arc, transitioning from a worm's-eye view to a low-angle, hip-level view. In this new perspective, the child is now upright in the center of the frame, flanked by the two adults, while the initial foreground and background elements are no longer in the shot, except for the light green ceiling. The figures remain completely still as the camera moves. The scene captures an indoor environment with a vintage film quality, featuring a greenish tint, deep focus, and low resolution. Black letterbox bars are on the left and right sides, and a dark vignette frames the entire view. The adults’ faces are not fully visible, but their clothing and physical interaction with the child are clear, indicating a collaborative effort centered on the child.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins from a ground-level, upside-down worm's-eye perspective, looking directly up at a person. The camera then cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a low-angle, hip-level view. The entire scene is maintained in deep focus.",
    "Subject": "The video centers on a young child with medium skin, curly brown hair, and wearing a green shirt, light-colored shorts, red socks, and brown boots, who is being lifted or supported by two adults. One adult, positioned on the left, wears a white shirt and is seen holding the child by the waist, while the other adult, on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeve shirt and assists in supporting the child’s back. The child is oriented upright and appears to be the main focus, with the adults’ actions directed toward helping or positioning the child. The adults’ faces are not fully visible, but their clothing and physical interaction with the child are clear, indicating a collaborative effort centered on the child.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a child being held in the air by two adults. The figures remain completely still as the camera moves, starting from an upside-down worm's eye view and then craning upward.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an indoor scene with a frequently changing perspective. It starts with a ground-level, upside-down worm's eye view and transitions to a low-angle, hip-level perspective. The ceiling is light green, and the walls are white and textured. Initially, the soles of the shoes of the person being held are facing the camera, with no other shoes visible. In the first part of the video, framed pictures are visible on the wall in the upper right, and a large, dark, round object, possibly the bottom of a desk, is partially visible in the left foreground. These elements move out of the frame as the camera shifts. The footage has a vintage film quality with a greenish tint, deep focus, and low resolution. Black letterbox bars are on the left and right sides, and a dark vignette frames the entire view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
