  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, the scene begins with a black assault rifle with a red dot sight held in the foreground at the bottom right, aimed past a white, paneled door on the left. The camera, slightly unsteady, turns left around the door frame, revealing a dark interior of a house through a monochromatic green night-vision filter. As the camera moves forward and pans right, it shifts the view into a hallway, passing a light switch on the wall. A man with a beard, wearing a head covering and a tactical vest, enters the room with a flashlight in his left hand raised, while his right hand is positioned at his waist holding a gun. He emerges in the middle ground, framed centrally by a doorway in the background. The player's weapon remains in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, now aimed toward the man. To the right of the man, a small table, a chair, and a potted plant are visible. Upon spotting the enemy, the camera tilts up to aim, shifting the view to a low angle. The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. On-screen text includes subtitles at the bottom center, a \"Checkpoint\" notification in the top left, and an ammunition counter in the bottom right. The subtitles incorporate a mix of white, red, and green text for clarity: \"Price:\" in green followed by \"I've lost visual. You're on your own for now.\" in white; \"AI-Qatala Fighter 2:\" in red followed by \"I am going to beat you to death even after you give me the location!\" in white; and \"Hostage:\" in green followed by \"I don't have a location...\" in white. This color-coding helps differentiate between speakers and enhances the viewing experience.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates a dark interior of a house, viewed through a monochromatic green night-vision filter. The perspective moves from behind a white, paneled door into a hallway, passing a light switch on the wall. In the background, a doorway opens into another room where a figure in tactical gear is visible near a small table, a chair, and a potted plant. The scene features several on-screen overlay elements, including a \"Checkpoint\" notification in the top-left corner, and a heads-up display in the lower-right showing an ammunition count. The subtitles at the bottom incorporate a mix of white, red, and green text for clarity: \"Price:\" in green followed by \"I've lost visual. You're on your own for now.\" in white; \"AI-Qatala Fighter 2:\" in red followed by \"I am going to beat you to death even after you give me the location!\" in white; and \"Hostage:\" in green followed by \"I don't have a location...\" in white.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
