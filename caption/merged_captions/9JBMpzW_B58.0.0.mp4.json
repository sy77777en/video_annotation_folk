  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide scenery shot is captured from a vantage point on the bow of a large cargo ship, positioned at a height between aerial and overhead levels. The foreground and middle ground are occupied by the ship's deck and the tops of stacked shipping containers in shades of blue, red, and white, which fill the bottom third of the frame. In the middle ground, the dark, calm ocean stretches towards the horizon, which is positioned centrally. The background is dominated by a vast, star-filled sky that occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame, with a green and faint red aurora glowing along the horizon. Throughout the timelapse, dark, low-lying clouds drift towards the camera, partially obscuring the aurora and stars, adding a sense of movement and depth to the atmospheric scene. The camera, positioned between an aerial and overhead level, moves forward continuously over the containers on the ship, capturing the breathtaking night-time seascape scenery. The timelapse effect causes the stars, clouds, and the ethereal glow of the aurora to sweep across the frame at an accelerated speed, with the vibrant green aurora dancing and shimmering along the horizon above the clouds. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and utilizes a deep focus, ensuring that both the boat in the foreground and middle ground, as well as the vast, star-filled sky, remain clear. An overlay at the bottom right of the screen displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram icon and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube icon, grounding the viewer within this spectacular natural light show.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a smooth, quickly moving camera positioned between an aerial and overhead level on a boat. The camera moves forward continuously over the containers on the ship. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and utilizes a deep focus, ensuring that both the boat in the foreground and middle ground, as well as the vast, star-filled sky, remain clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a breathtaking night-time seascape scenery shot, captured from the bow of a large cargo ship. The primary focus is on the immense and dynamic environment rather than a specific subject, emphasizing the vastness of nature. The camera looks out over a dark, calm ocean towards a horizon where a faint, ethereal green and reddish glow of an aurora dances beneath a sky blanketed with an incredible density of brilliant stars. Dark, low-lying clouds drift across the frame, partially obscuring the celestial display and adding a sense of movement and depth to the atmospheric scene. Both the foreground and middle ground are occupied by the deck and the tops of shipping containers, which serve as a stable vantage point, grounding the viewer within this spectacular natural light show.",
    "Motion": "This is a stunning timelapse video of the night sky as seen from the bow of a large ship at sea. The sky is a breathtaking canvas of countless stars. A vibrant green aurora, possibly the aurora borealis or australis, dances and shimmers along the horizon above the clouds. The timelapse effect causes the stars, clouds, and the ethereal glow of the aurora to sweep across the frame at an accelerated speed.",
    "Scene": "From a vantage point on the bow of a large ship at sea, a timelapse captures a night sky filled with countless bright stars. A green and faint red aurora glows on the horizon, partially obscured by dark clouds that move swiftly across the scene. In the foreground and middle ground, the tops of stacked shipping containers in shades of blue, red, and white are visible on the deck of the vessel, which sits on the dark, calm ocean. An overlay at the bottom right of the screen displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram icon and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube icon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
