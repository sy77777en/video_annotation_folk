  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, from a first-person perspective, follows an upward-sloping stone and dirt path that originates in the bottom foreground and extends towards the center-middle ground. On the left, a steep hillside covered in dense, verdant foliage occupies the foreground and middle ground. To the right, the terrain with trees and undergrowth slopes downwards, also spanning the foreground and middle ground. A lone hiker, initially positioned in the top-center of the middle ground, moves further into the background while ascending the path. Distant trees and a small waterfall are visible in the background, to the right of the trail. The video highlights a rocky, stone staircase in the foreground, which is uneven and challenging to navigate. A person carrying a red coat is seen ascending the staircase, moving steadily upward as the camera follows their progress. As the camera advances along the path, foreground elements such as rocks and plants shift towards the edges of the frame or pass out of view, while elements previously in the middle ground, like sections of the path and surrounding vegetation, transition into the foreground. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking downwards, but as the first-person camera moves forward, it tilts slightly upwards, transitioning to a level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. The movement is unsteady and shaky. The outdoor setting is a dense, lush green forest, with abundant vegetation, including ferns and trees. The scene is naturally lit, indicating daytime, and in the background, more trees and a small, distant waterfall or stream can be seen to the right of the path.",

    "Subject": "This is a nature scenery shot depicting a rugged, upward-sloping stone and dirt path winding through a dense, verdant forest. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immersive environment of the trail itself, the lush foliage clinging to the steep hillside on the left, and the dense trees and undergrowth on the right, conveying the atmosphere and scale of the natural landscape rather than a specific entity. A lone hiker carrying a red coat is seen ascending the path in the distance, but they serve more as an element within the scene, emphasizing the trail's use and scale, rather than being the central point of interest.",
    "Motion": "The video highlights a rocky, stone staircase in the foreground, which is uneven and challenging to navigate. A person carrying a red coat is seen ascending the staircase, moving steadily upward as the camera follows their progress. The path is surrounded by dense green foliage, with lush greenery, including trees and bushes, indicating a forested area.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a perspective moving along a steep, uneven pathway constructed from large, irregularly shaped, light gray and brown stones and packed earth. The outdoor setting is a dense, lush green forest, with abundant vegetation, including ferns and trees. On the left side of the path, the embankment slopes upward, while the right side descends downward. A person carrying a bright red coat and dark clothing is visible further up the path, walking uphill. The scene is naturally lit, indicating daytime, and in the background, more trees and a small, distant waterfall or stream can be seen to the right of the path.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
