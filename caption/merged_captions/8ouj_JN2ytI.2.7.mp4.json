  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a bald, light-skinned man positioned in the center foreground, wearing a complex black mask over his nose and mouth, secured by a strap over the top of his head. He is dressed in a heavy brown leather jacket with a thick, off-white shearling collar. With his left hand, he holds a microphone-like device up to his mask, with a pair of black and white headphones connected below the device. The camera captures this low-angle, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. As the camera smoothly arcs counter-clockwise around him, he exhibits slight upper body movement as he speaks. To the left behind him, another bald, light-skinned man stands in the middle ground with a serious expression, wearing a dark vest. Other figures are visible on the far left and right, also in the middle ground, including a dark-skinned man with short hair on the right and another light-skinned man with dark hair on the far left. The background gradually transitions from a crowded stadium, where spectators dressed in yellow stand still, to a large structure covered in various billboards, including advertisements for UPMC, xfinity, and Under Armour. One of the digital screens on the left of the billboard displays a close-up of the main figure, set against the grey sky. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level, stopping and panning slightly to the right, maintaining focus on the central figure as the scene unfolds on an overcast day at the stadium.",

    "Motion": "The central figure, a bald man, holds a device in his left hand and exhibits slight upper body movement as he speaks. Behind him, another bald man in the middle ground observes with a stern expression. The other individuals in the further middle ground remain motionless, and all the spectators wearing yellow in the background stand still.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds at a stadium on an overcast day. In the background, stadium bleachers are filled with a crowd dressed in yellow. As the camera rotates counterclockwise around the central figure at a low angle, the background gradually transitions from the crowded stadium to a large structure covered in various billboards, including advertisements for UPMC, xfinity, and Under Armour. One of the digital screens on the billboard displays a close-up of the main figure, set against the grey sky.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. To the left behind him, another man stands in the middle ground, with other figures visible on the far left and right, also in the middle ground. As the camera rotates counterclockwise around the central man at a low angle, the background gradually transitions from a crowded stadium to a large billboard.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
