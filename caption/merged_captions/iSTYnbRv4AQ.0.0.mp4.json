  "merged_caption": "This wide shot moves rapidly forward down the center of a street, creating a strong radial motion blur that emanates from the background. Initially, a red car is stationary in the right-center middle ground, and a green scooter is positioned in the left middle ground, both parked on the pavement. As the camera moves forward, the red car shifts to the bottom right foreground and eventually exits the frame, while the green scooter moves to the bottom left foreground and also exits the frame. A small figure wearing a red top is visible in the foreground, moving into the midground as she quickens her pace. The scene is framed by tall, classical multi-story buildings with uniform, sandy-colored facades on the left and right sides, which recede from the middle ground to the background. A central pedestrian walkway acts as a vanishing point, where small figures of people are visible walking in the distant background. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the street but is above the distant subjects it moves towards. This time-lapse video features a smooth and quick forward dolly shot down a city street, captured from a level, eye-level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. While tracking the general flow of the street, causing subjects to become smaller as they move into the distance, the camera briefly trucks left and then pedestals upward. The fast-moving perspective down a wide European avenue at sunrise or sunset is characterized by a strong radial motion blur due to the camera's movement. The central pedestrian walkway is flanked by bare trees, and a few distant figures walk towards the horizon, where the sky glows with orange and pink hues.",

    "Subject": "A red car, appearing stationary and facing left, is in the foreground. A small figure wearing a red top moves from the foreground into the midground as she increases her speed. On the left side of the street, a bright green, stand-up electric scooter is parked on the pavement. In the distance, down the center of the wide street, the small, indistinct figures of several people can be seen walking.",
    "Motion": "The scene moves forward at a high speed, causing the buildings on either side of the street to blur radially. A red car appears stationary, facing left in the foreground, while a green scooter is parked and stationary on the left sidewalk. In the foreground, a small figure wearing a red top moves into the midground as she increases her pace. In the distance, several people walk along the central pedestrian area.",
    "Scene": "A fast-moving perspective down a wide European avenue at sunrise or sunset is characterized by a strong radial motion blur due to the camera's movement. The street is lined on both sides by tall, classical multi-story buildings with uniform, sandy-colored facades. In the foreground, a red car appears blurred from the camera's motion, and a light green scooter is parked on the left. A small figure in a red top is in the foreground, moving into the midground as she increases her speed. The central pedestrian walkway is flanked by bare trees, and a few distant figures walk towards the horizon, where the sky glows with orange and pink hues.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
