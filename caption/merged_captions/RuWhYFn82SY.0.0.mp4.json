  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a person with curly, dark brown hair and a light complexion, wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved top, occupies the center of the frame in the foreground while on a swing. The subject is in constant, rapid motion, swinging back and forth horizontally across the frame, which creates significant motion blur. They hold onto the swing's supports with both hands as they arc through the air in a continuous, repetitive motion. The camera is positioned at the subject's level with a fixed Dutch angle and remains slightly unsteady, contributing to the dynamic feel of the scene. In the background, a dense wall of green trees is visible behind a grassy area that extends into the middle ground. The outdoor scene is set in a grassy clearing bordered by a dense wall of green trees and foliage under natural daylight. The ground is covered in a mix of green and dry, light-brown grass. The rapid motion creates a significant blur, obscuring the person's features and parts of the background. The video shows a boy on a swing against a blurry background, with low resolution and motion blur affecting clarity.",

    "Subject": "A person with curly, dark brown hair and a light complexion is shown in motion while on a swing. They are wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved top and are holding onto the swing's supports with both hands. Due to the rapid movement, their facial features are blurred.",
    "Motion": "A person on a swing moves rapidly back and forth, creating significant motion blur. They hold onto the swing's supports as they arc through the air in a continuous, repetitive motion.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set in a grassy clearing bordered by a dense wall of green trees and foliage under natural daylight. The ground is covered in a mix of green and dry, light-brown grass. A person in a dark blue shirt is on a swing, moving back and forth. The rapid motion creates a significant blur, obscuring the person's features and parts of the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
