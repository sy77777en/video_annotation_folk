  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a mountain biker wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark pants, and a white helmet is positioned on a large, curved wooden ramp in the upper-left middle ground, with the camera initially at the subject's level. The ramp structure, built into a rugged, reddish-brown canyon, extends across the center and right of the frame, featuring a high starting platform and a series of curved ramps supported by a wooden framework. The arid landscape is characterized by layered rock formations and sparse green vegetation. Black flags with a white circular logo are placed along the course, and a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo is displayed on a rock face in the bottom-left foreground. Several spectators are visible on a platform in the top-center background and on the hillside above, observing the biker. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts down to track the mountain biker as they ride down the ramp. Upon reaching the end of the ramp, the biker launches into the air, moving toward the left and bottom of the frame while performing a complete backward flip with the bike. As the biker descends, the camera's perspective shifts to a high angle, looking down as they land on a dirt path in the lower-left portion of the scene and continue to ride down the hillside. The weather conditions are not clearly visible, but the scene suggests a dry and bright environment typical of a canyon setting.",

    "Camera": "This is a high-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and the action sharp. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts down to track a mountain biker as they ride down a series of wooden ramps built into the canyon.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a mountain biker wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark pants, and a white helmet, who rides down a large wooden ramp structure built into a reddish-brown canyon. The biker launches into the air, performs a backflip with the bike, and lands on a dirt path below. Several other people are visible in the background, standing on a wooden platform and on the hillside above, watching the biker. The course includes multiple wooden ramps, and black flags with a white circular logo are placed along the route. A large sign with the \"Red Bull\" logo is visible on the rocks at the bottom of the scene.",
    "Motion": "A mountain biker rides down a large, curved wooden ramp built into a canyon. Upon reaching the end of the ramp, the biker launches into the air, performing a complete backward flip with the bike. The biker then lands on a dirt path below the ramp structure and continues to ride down the hillside. In the background, several spectators stand still on a wooden platform and the surrounding hillside, observing the biker.",
    "Scene": "A daytime scene unfolds in a rugged, reddish-brown canyon, where a large, multi-tiered wooden ramp structure is built into the steep, rocky hillside. This structure features a high starting platform and a series of curved ramps supported by a wooden framework. The arid landscape is characterized by layered rock formations and sparse green vegetation. Black flags and white, ring-shaped objects bearing logos are positioned along the course, and a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo is displayed on a rock face in the lower portion of the scene. A small group of spectators observes from a ledge above the main structure, while a cyclist on a mountain bike descends the course, launching from the upper ramp onto a dirt path below. The weather conditions are not clearly visible, but the scene suggests a dry and bright environment typical of a canyon setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
