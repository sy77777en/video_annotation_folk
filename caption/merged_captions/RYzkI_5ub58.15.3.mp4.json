  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an underwater scene, showcasing a coral reef structure prominently positioned at the center of the frame. The coral formation occupies the middle ground, with its rough textures and varied colors contrasting against the deep blue water that fills the background. Numerous small, colorful fish are dispersed throughout the frame, swimming in various directions, primarily in the foreground and middle ground, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. The sandy ocean floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, providing a base for the coral and enhancing the overall spatial composition. The camera is underwater, positioned at a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs a deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the coral and surrounding fish clearly. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking, maintaining the coral at the center while the fish move around it, emphasizing the lively underwater ecosystem. The water is a deep blue, providing a striking contrast to the lighter sandy ocean floor. The lighting suggests a bright, sunlit day, with sunlight filtering through the water, enhancing the visibility and colors of the marine life. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the underwater ecosystem. The emphasis is on the ecosystem's beauty and scale, rather than a specific object, showcasing the harmony and diversity of underwater life. The coral structure is diverse, with various textures and shapes, creating a vibrant marine environment. The setting features a coral reef structure at the center, composed of various corals with rough textures and a mix of green and brown hues.",

    "Subject": "The video is an underwater scenery shot. It focuses on the vibrant marine environment, highlighting the rich blue water and a coral formation at the center. The coral is surrounded by numerous small, colorful fish swimming in various directions, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere. The emphasis is on the ecosystem's beauty and scale, rather than a specific object, showcasing the harmony and diversity of underwater life.",
    "Motion": "The video depicts an underwater scene featuring a coral reef. The reef is surrounded by clear blue water and numerous small fish swimming around it. The coral structure is diverse, with various textures and shapes, creating a vibrant marine environment.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an underwater scene in a clear, vibrant ocean environment. The setting features a coral reef structure at the center, composed of various corals with rough textures and a mix of green and brown hues. Surrounding the reef, numerous small fish swim in different directions, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The water is a deep blue, providing a striking contrast to the lighter sandy ocean floor. The lighting suggests a bright, sunlit day, with sunlight filtering through the water, enhancing the visibility and colors of the marine life. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the underwater ecosystem.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of an underwater scene, showcasing a coral reef structure prominently positioned at the center of the frame. The coral formation occupies the middle ground, with its rough textures and varied colors contrasting against the deep blue water that fills the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
