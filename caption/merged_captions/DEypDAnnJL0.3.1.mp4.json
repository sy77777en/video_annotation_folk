  "merged_caption": "In this static over-the-shoulder shot, a person with light skin and dark, curly hair is positioned in the right foreground, out of focus, with the back of their head and bare left shoulder occupying the right third of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a shallow depth of field to focus on a smiley face made of dark, dripping marks on a white tiled wall, located in the center-left background. The smiley face is composed of two dots for eyes and a wide, arcing mouth made of several dots, with dark liquid dripping down the tiles in thin streams. To the far left, a shower curtain with a light green leaf pattern on a white background is visible. The person in the foreground remains mostly still, with a subtle movement towards the end as they rub their hands on their bare left shoulder, while the dripping smiley face on the wall in the background adds an intriguing element to the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the smiley face drawn on the tiled wall in the background.",
    "Subject": "This over-the-shoulder shot features a person with light skin and dark, curly hair, seen from behind and out of focus in the right foreground. Only the back of their head and their bare left shoulder are visible. The focus is on a white tiled wall in the background, which has a smiley face on it. The face is composed of numerous small, dark, circular marks, with dark liquid dripping down from the curved line of the mouth.",
    "Motion": "The person in the foreground remains mostly still, with a subtle movement towards the end as they rub their hands on their bare left shoulder, while the dripping smiley face on the wall in the background adds an intriguing element to the scene.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, reveals an indoor bathroom setting. The focus is on a wall of white, square tiles where a smiley face has been drawn with a dark, liquid substance. The face is composed of two dots for eyes and a wide, arcing mouth made of several dots, with the dark liquid dripping down the tiles in thin streams. To the left, a shower curtain features a light green leaf pattern on a white background. The back and curly hair of a person are visible in the foreground on the right.",
    "Spatial": "In this static over-the-shoulder shot, a person is positioned in the right foreground, out of focus, with the back of their head and shoulder occupying the right third of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
