  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person with medium-length, straight red hair, wearing a white shirt, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the person in white with a shallow depth of field. It moves forward smoothly while panning left to track the person as they walk through a cozy living room with wood-paneled walls and a warm, inviting atmosphere. As the person continues to walk, they turn and head towards their left. The room includes various elements such as a wooden door, a fireplace with a painting above it, and a lamp, which remain stationary. However, their positions in the frame change due to the camera's movement: the door and fireplace exit the frame on the right, the initial lamp shifts to the right, and another lamp appears on the left. Additionally, a window and dining table become visible on the left in the middle ground. In the background, another individual in a yellow top becomes visible, standing near a table with various items on it. The person in the yellow top appears to be reaching for an object leaning against the wall, extending their left hand to grasp something. The environment is illuminated by natural light filtering through the windows, contributing to the homely feel with earthy tones and soft textures. The decor includes a variety of furnishings such as two lamps, a plant, a vase of yellow flowers, and a single armchair, with the ceiling contrasting in white against the predominantly wood-colored walls. The focus remains primarily on the person with red hair as they move through the space.",

    "Spatial": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person with short, red hair, wearing a white shirt, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera follows the subject from behind as they move forward. As the camera pans left, another individual in a yellow top appears from the left side of the frame and continues to the center, while the main subject is slightly left of center. The room includes various elements such as a wooden door, a fireplace with a painting above it, and a lamp, which remain stationary. However, their positions in the frame change due to the camera's movement: the door and fireplace exit the frame on the right, the initial lamp shifts to the right, and another lamp appears on the left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
