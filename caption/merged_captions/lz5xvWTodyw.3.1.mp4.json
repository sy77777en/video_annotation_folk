  "merged_caption": "This is a tracking shot filmed from above the second car of a colorful, futuristic locomotive in an urban environment. Initially, the vibrant front of the vehicle, adorned with hues of pink, blue, and yellow, occupies the center foreground, extending from the bottom of the frame. The camera captures the vehicle as it travels forward, appearing to float through the air with no visible tracks, and ascends, creating a high-angle view. In the middle ground, other multi-colored, segmented vehicles navigate roads in the bottom left and center, flanked by tall skyscrapers on the left and right. A large white arrow is positioned in the top center, pointing forward along the direction of the street below. As the shot progresses, the vehicle ascends while moving forward, and the camera also moves forward and rises, transitioning into a high-angle view while remaining positioned above the second car. The cityscape, bathed in a pink and purple glow from the setting sun, extends from the middle ground to the background below, with a body of water on the horizon. The tops of the skyscrapers, which initially tower above the vehicle, are now seen from above, with part of one skyscraper’s rooftop appearing on the left side of the frame as the vehicle passes by it while beginning to descend. The camera follows, descending and panning slightly to the left to keep the train centered in the lower central part of the frame. Throughout the shot, UI elements remain fixed in the corners and bottom of the frame: a minimap and segment counter in the bottom left, a passenger counter in the bottom center, a gauge in the bottom right, and a location marker in the top right. When the video concludes, the train is positioned in the lower center-right portion of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera tracks a moving train from a smooth, aerial perspective. It begins at ground level, roughly at the height of the second floor, and maintains a steady forward motion as it ascends to a high point. As the train descends and turns, the camera follows, also descending and panning slightly to the left to keep the train centered in the lower central part of the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a colorful, futuristic locomotive in an urban environment, captured through a dynamic tracking shot. The locomotive, adorned with vibrant hues of pink, blue, and yellow, is prominently positioned in the foreground, occupying about half of the frame's height. It is connected to multiple brightly colored train cars in motion. The camera begins above the second car of the moving train, ascending and moving forward to provide a high-angle view, though not directly overhead. This perspective reveals a sprawling cityscape with tall buildings, palm trees, and a network of train tracks. The detailed urban landscape, with various structures and roads, serves as a dynamic backdrop to the train's movement, with the locomotive and its cars as the main subjects.",
    "Motion": "A colorful, multi-segmented vehicle, resembling an urban light rail or train, travels forward through a futuristic city. Filmed from above the second car, the camera captures the vehicle as it ascends and moves forward, creating a high-angle view. The vehicle appears to float through the air, with no visible tracks supporting it. As it reaches a peak above the skyscrapers, the camera continues to advance and rise, maintaining its position above the second car while offering a sweeping view of the cityscape below.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a dynamic scene in a stylized, futuristic city at sunset, viewed from a perspective above the second car of a moving vehicle. This vehicle, resembling an urban light rail or train with a vibrant, rainbow-colored exterior, appears to float as it travels through the air, with no visible tracks. The cityscape is bathed in a pink and purple glow from the setting sun, which is a bright orb on the horizon over a body of water. Below, numerous other multi-colored, segmented vehicles navigate a complex network of tracks, with palm trees lining the streets. A large white arrow, part of the scene, points downward and aligns with the front of the vehicle. The camera angle transitions from level to high, providing a high-angle view while remaining above the second car. Overlay elements enhance the scene: \"Beach\" appears at the top right, a \"segments\" counter and circular minimap are in the bottom left, and a circular gauge with a percentage and numerical value is in the bottom right. At the bottom center, an overlay displays \"280 / 4040 Passengers,\" with a partially filled purple line underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
