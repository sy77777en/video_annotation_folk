  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a light-skinned man, appearing to be in his late 20s or early 30s, stands still in the foreground center of the frame, outdoors at dusk. He has dark, neatly styled hair parted on the side, is clean-shaven, and wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt that is unbuttoned at the top. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, executing a smooth, counterclockwise arc around him. The man initially stands with his hands naturally together in front of him, then raises both hands with his palms facing up and smiles faintly. In the background, trees are visible on the left, and a large building with a smooth, white exterior is on the right. Two vintage, light-colored buses with rounded fronts are parked in the left background, their retro designs contrasting with the stark, angular lines of the building. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit, urban environment during twilight, with the approach of night evident. The ground is paved and appears slightly uneven, with scattered patches of gravel. The surrounding area is lined with sparse trees, their silhouettes dark against the fading light. The overall atmosphere is quiet, with a sense of stillness, as the camera captures the scene from a detached perspective, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow. The shallow depth of field keeps the man in the foreground in focus, enhancing the temporal coherence of the scene as the camera movement and the man's gestures unfold in harmony with the setting.",

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in an outdoor setting, characterized by a dimly lit, urban environment during twilight. The approach of night is evident. The ground is paved and appears slightly uneven, with scattered patches of gravel. In the background, two vintage yellow buses are parked, their rounded shapes and retro designs contrasting with the stark, angular lines of a nearby building, which has a smooth, white exterior. The surrounding area is lined with sparse trees, their silhouettes dark against the fading light. The overall atmosphere is quiet, with a sense of stillness, as the camera captures the scene from a detached perspective, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
