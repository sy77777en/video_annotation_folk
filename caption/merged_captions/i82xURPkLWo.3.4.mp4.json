  "merged_caption": "A man is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. He is a middle-aged man with dark skin, a very short, buzzed haircut, and a neatly trimmed goatee, wearing a plain, muted reddish-brown, short-sleeved t-shirt. To his right, a weathered green wooden post stands in the middle ground. The background is composed of a rustic, wood-paneled interior, possibly an enclosed porch or cabin, with vertical wooden planks and some sections painted in a weathered, light green finish. A window in the top right quadrant reveals a bright, green, and wooded outdoor area. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot, employing a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The man's mouth moves as he speaks, and he blinks. While his upper body remains mostly still, he slightly raises his head and nods subtly throughout the clip. He is seated and looking slightly to his left with a serious expression on his face.",

    "Camera": "A fixed, eye-level shot focuses on a man in the foreground, employing a shallow depth of field that blurs the background.",
    "Subject": "A middle-aged man with dark skin is shown from the chest up. He has a very short, buzzed haircut and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is wearing a plain, muted reddish-brown, short-sleeved t-shirt. He is seated and looking slightly to his left with a serious expression on his face.",
    "Motion": "The man's mouth moves as he speaks, and he blinks. While his upper body remains mostly still, he slightly raises his head and nods subtly throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set during the day within a rustic, wood-paneled interior, possibly an enclosed porch or cabin. The walls are constructed from vertical wooden planks, with some sections and a prominent post painted in a weathered, light green finish. A window in the background provides a view of a bright, green, and wooded outdoor area. A man in a brown t-shirt is seated in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "A man is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. To his right, a weathered green wooden post stands in the middle ground. The background is composed of a wooden interior, with a window in the top right quadrant revealing a green, wooded area outside. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
