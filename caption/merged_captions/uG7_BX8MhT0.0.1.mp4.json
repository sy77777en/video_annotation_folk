  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, initially frames a person's hand with a light skin tone in the top right foreground as it begins to zip a large, dark brown leather bag. The bag, made of a textured, pebbled leather, occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom right to the top left in the foreground. The hand grasps a prominent, brass-colored metal zipper pull and moves it along the track to close the main compartment. As the hand pulls the zipper from right to left across the top of the bag, the camera, from a high, hip-level angle, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the brown leather bag in the foreground. The camera smoothly trucks left and moves slightly forward to track the hand zipping the bag, finishing with a slight pan to the right. The hand concludes its movement in the top left of the frame, while the bag remains the central element, with its left side becoming more prominent by the end of the shot. A smaller zippered pocket is also visible on the side of the bag. The mid-ground and background are softly out of focus throughout the clip, set in a brightly lit indoor setting, with the bag resting on a light-colored surface.",

    "Camera": "From a high, hip-level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the brown leather bag in the foreground. The camera smoothly trucks left and moves slightly forward to track the hand zipping the bag, finishing with a slight pan to the right.",
    "Subject": "A person's hand with a light skin tone is shown zipping a large, dark brown bag. The bag is made of a pebbled leather material and features a prominent, brass-colored metal zipper running along its top opening. The hand grasps the zipper pull and moves it along the track to close the main compartment. A smaller zippered pocket is also visible on the side of the bag.",
    "Motion": "A hand with a light skin tone grasps a brass zipper pull and slides it along the track to close the main compartment of a dark brown, pebbled leather bag.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit indoor setting, a hand is shown zipping a large, dark brown bag. The bag, made of a textured, pebbled leather, rests on a light-colored surface. A prominent brass-colored zipper runs along the top edge, and the hand's fingers are seen guiding the zipper pull smoothly along its track. A smaller zippered pocket is also visible on the side of the bag, while the background remains softly out of focus.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, initially frames a person's hand in the top right foreground as it begins to zip a large, dark brown leather bag. The bag itself occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom right to the top left in the foreground. As the hand pulls the zipper from right to left across the top of the bag, the camera moves slightly to the left, following the action. The hand concludes its movement in the top left of the frame, while the bag remains the central element, with its left side becoming more prominent by the end of the shot. The mid-ground and background are softly out of focus throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
