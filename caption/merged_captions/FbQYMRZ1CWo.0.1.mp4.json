  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, an older, white-haired man with light skin occupies the left foreground, smiling broadly in a black suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt. A text overlay in the bottom-left corner identifies him as \"Richard H. Thaler, PhD\" and lists his professional credentials, including \"Father of 'Behavioral Economics'.\" To his right, a young woman with long, dark brown hair and tan skin is positioned in the right foreground, also smiling. She wears a black top, and a text overlay in the top-right area identifies her as \"Selena Gomez, International Pop Star.\" A third woman in a leopard-print top stands in the background, centered between the two main subjects, holding a glass. The scene is set at a crowded indoor social gathering, likely a party or reception, with other attendees visible in the blurred background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, executing a smooth, slight backward movement followed by a brief pan to the left, then remains stationary. The older man consistently maintains his gaze on the young woman, who initially turns her head noticeably to her right before turning back. There are some minor unsteady shakes before the frame pauses to capture the two individuals' smiles, transitioning to a static image in the crowded environment.",

    "Motion": "An older man on the left and a younger woman on the right stand close together, both smiling and looking toward each other. The woman initially turns her head noticeably to her right before turning back, while the man consistently maintains his gaze on her. The camera performs a smooth, slight backward movement followed by a brief pan to the left, after which it remains stationary.

    "Scene": "The scene is set at a crowded indoor social gathering, likely a party or reception. In the foreground, a man with white hair wearing a dark suit jacket and a woman with dark, styled hair are seen smiling. Other attendees are visible in the blurred background, with one woman wearing a leopard-print top and holding a drink. White text overlays are superimposed on the video. In the lower-left corner, text identifies \"Richard H. Thaler, PhD\" and lists his professional credentials, including \"Father of 'Behavioral Economics'\". In the upper-right area, another overlay identifies \"Selena Gomez, International Pop Star\".",

A third woman stands in the background, centered between the two main subjects. A text overlay is superimposed in the bottom-left corner of the frame, while another text overlay appears in the top-right area. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
