  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a fast-moving, blurry, high-angle shot of two motorcyclists, one ahead of the other, in the top left of the frame. The camera, from a high, overhead perspective, is tilted at a varying Dutch angle as it smoothly and rapidly flies in a complex pattern. It pans right to track the motorcyclists turning on a racetrack, transitioning from an extreme wide shot to a full shot as they get closer. The scene is set in a vast desert landscape under a clear, light blue sky, with a dark asphalt racetrack curving through the beige, sandy terrain marked with tire tracks. As the motorcyclists, both in a forward-leaning racing posture, approach the camera, the scene shifts to a full shot, capturing both riders leaning into a long curve. The view reverts to an extreme wide shot as they speed away, with one maintaining a slight lead over the other. In the final composition, the two motorcyclists are small figures in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame as they travel along the racetrack. The track curves from the bottom right through the middle ground, surrounded by sandy desert in the left foreground and midground on the right. A mountain range and a clear sky occupy the background at the top of the frame. The camera maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective. In the distance, a range of brown, rocky mountains lines the horizon, completing the expansive, arid environment.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead perspective, the camera is tilted at a varying Dutch angle as it smoothly and rapidly flies in a complex pattern. It pans right to track a group of motorcyclists turning on a racetrack, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track, with one rider positioned ahead of the other. Both are in a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a fast, blurry, high-angle shot of a motorcycle speeding down a road. It then transitions to an extreme wide shot of two motorcyclists racing on a track in a desert. As they approach the camera, the scene shifts to a full shot, capturing both riders leaning into a long curve. The view reverts to an extreme wide shot as they speed away, with one maintaining a slight lead over the other.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-moving, blurry view of two vehicles on a paved road before pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective. The scene is set in a vast desert landscape under a clear, light blue sky. A dark asphalt racetrack curves through the beige, sandy terrain, which is marked with tire tracks alongside the road. In the distance, a range of brown, rocky mountains lines the horizon. Two vehicles are visible driving along the track in this expansive, arid environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
