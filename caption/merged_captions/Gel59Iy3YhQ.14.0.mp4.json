  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a cartoonish, spooky graveyard at night under a rainy sky, with the camera static at eye level and maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the scene. The scene is dimly lit, with gnarled, leafless trees silhouetted against a dark, cloudy backdrop where a distant castle with glowing windows sits atop a hill, slightly to the left. The graveyard is filled with various stone and bread-shaped tombstones, some broken or tilted, scattered across the middle ground. A dark wooden fence lines part of the graveyard to the middle ground left, and a faint glow emanates from a lantern in the middle ground center-right. The ground is dark and scattered with what appears to be grass or debris. Between the foreground and middle ground, an upright bread-shaped tombstone stands left of center, near two flat bread slices lying on the ground—one in the center-left and another in the center-right. These objects resemble slices of light brown bread with darker crusts, some appearing whole and others partially eaten. As the frames progress, occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the scene, casting eerie shadows across the graveyard. The lighting changes, and the two bread slices begin to animate, standing upright with glowing red eyes and small brown legs in their respective positions, as a third similar animated figure also animates to stand up from its position on the farther ground. The animated bread slices start to look around, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. Rain is visibly falling throughout, enhancing the eerie atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "The video features three objects resembling slices of light brown bread with darker crusts, some appearing whole and others partially eaten, scattered on the ground. These upright bread slices later appear animated, possessing small brown legs and two glowing red eyes.",
    "Motion": "The scene is set in a dark, eerie environment with a gloomy sky, twisted trees, and a distant castle in the background. The ground is littered with stones, coffins, and tombstones.

The graveyard is filled with various stone and bread-shaped tombstones, some of which are broken or tilted. The ground is dark and scattered with what appears to be grass or debris. A dark wooden fence lines part of the graveyard, and a faint glow emanates from a lantern and some of the castle's windows. Rain is visibly falling throughout the scene. In the middleground, three previously lying bread-shaped objects briefly animate, with their \"eyes\" glowing red. Occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the scene, casting eerie shadows across the graveyard.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a cartoonish graveyard, with the camera initially positioned above the foreground elements and remaining static throughout. A castle is visible in the background, slightly to the left, while gnarled trees occupy the left and right foreground and middle ground. Various stone tombstones are scattered across the middle ground, with a wooden fence to the middle ground left and a faintly glowing lantern in the middle ground center-right. Between the foreground and middle ground, an upright bread-shaped tombstone stands left of center, near two flat bread slices lying on the ground—one in the center-left and another in the center-right. These two bread slices then animate, standing upright with glowing red eyes in their respective positions, as a third similar animated figure also animates to stand up from its position on the farther ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
