  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, high-angle scenery shot of a train yard on a clear, sunny day. The main feature, a long train modified into a skatepark, is positioned diagonally, stretching from the bottom left foreground to the right middle ground. The train consists of blue shipping containers branded with Red Bull and Prada logos, with a continuous, light-tan-colored ramp system on top, featuring a step-up ramp leading to a higher section, followed by a step-down. Parallel to it, a second freight train with brown and grey tanker cars occupies the middle ground on the left side of the frame. A person wearing an orange safety vest stands on the ground in the bottom right foreground. The background consists of a line of green trees and distant hills stretching across the top of the scene. An animated red arrow overlay moves through the frame, starting in the top left, curving down towards the first ramp in the middle ground, then arcing up and over to the right, illustrating a path along the skatepark. The camera provides a smooth, overhead-level tracking shot that follows the overlaid arrow moving along the skate ramps, transitioning between fast and regular motion, maintaining a sharp and clear focus from the train in the foreground and midground to the landscape in the background. The camera moves forward and to the right, following the path indicated by the animated red arrow, providing a dynamic view of the scene. The scene is set in a railyard with gravel, patches of grass, and a person in an orange safety vest standing beside the train, enhancing the industrial atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, overhead-level tracking shot that follows an overlaid arrow moving along the skate ramps on a customized train. The video transitions between fast and regular motion, maintaining a sharp and clear focus from the train in the foreground and midground to the landscape in the background.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an industrial scenery shot of a unique, custom-built environment. The focus is on the impressive scale and creative design of the setting itself, rather than on a particular subject, showcasing a long stationary train transformed into a skatepark. The train consists of blue shipping containers, branded with Red Bull and Prada logos, sitting on tracks in a railyard next to another freight train with brown tanker cars. The tops of the blue containers are fitted with a continuous, light-tan-colored ramp system, featuring a step-up ramp leading to a higher section, followed by a step-down. A red animated arrow traces a potential path over these ramps. The scene is set on a clear, sunny day, with green trees and distant hills visible in the background, while a person in an orange safety vest stands on the ground beside the train.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a stationary train made of shipping containers. The containers, branded with Red Bull and Prada logos, have been converted into a long skatepark with a series of ramps. A red graphic arrow is overlaid on the image, tracing a path along the course.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed from a high-angle perspective provides a sweeping view of a unique setup in a train yard on a clear, sunny day. A long train composed of blue shipping containers sits on a track, with each container featuring a red stripe, the \"Red Bull\" logo, and the \"PRADA\" logo in white. Constructed atop these containers is a continuous, light-brown skate ramp with a series of curved ramps and transitions. On an adjacent track, a freight train with brown and grey tanker cars is visible. The surrounding area consists of gravel, patches of grass, and a line of green trees in the background. A person wearing an orange safety vest stands on the ground near the train. An animated red arrow, an overlay on the video, moves to illustrate a trajectory along the ramps.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
