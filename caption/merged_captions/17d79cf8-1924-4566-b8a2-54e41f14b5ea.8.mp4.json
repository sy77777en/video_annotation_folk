  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks, wearing purple patterned shorts, a white sleeve on his left arm, and a black band on his right wrist. His hands and a brick are centered in the foreground, positioned directly above a low wall that stretches across the middle ground. The person's legs and feet occupy the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. In the middle ground, a green basin of mortar is located in the bottom left, while a concrete staircase and a thin white guideline string are on the right. The ground of the construction site is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The hands press a rectangular, reddish-orange brick down into a layer of wet, gray mortar on the wall, then repeatedly adjust the brick, shifting it slightly to align it with the other bricks in the row. This first-person video is captured from an eye-level, upside-down high angle, providing a bird's-eye view of the person laying bricks. The camera is slightly unsteady, exhibiting both a shaking motion and a jerky back-and-forth movement to the left and right. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the hands to the ground below in sharp detail. The perspective looks down past the person's legs and feet towards their hands, which are carefully placing the brick onto a layer of wet mortar. Below him, a green plastic basin contains more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle. The ground below is reddish-brown dirt, and approximately one story below, a blue hose is visible. The hands make slight adjustments, holding onto the brick as it is placed on the wall.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks. He is wearing purple patterned shorts, a white sleeve on his left arm, and a black band on his right wrist. His hands are actively positioning a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a wall structure that is being built with wet, gray mortar. Below him, a green plastic basin contains more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set at an outdoor construction site during the day. The perspective looks down past the person's legs and feet towards their hands, which are carefully placing a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a layer of wet, gray mortar. This brick is being added to a low wall built upon a rough concrete foundation. The ground below is reddish-brown dirt, and approximately one story below, a blue hose is visible. On the same elevated level as the person, a green tub of mortar is positioned to the left of their legs, and a thin white guideline string is located to the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
