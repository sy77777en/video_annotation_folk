  "merged_caption": "In this extreme wide shot captured from above, elongated, blurred white headlights occupy the left background, while a single red taillight is positioned in the right background. The white headlights on the left move towards the lower left, while the red taillight on the right moves towards the upper right of the dark frame. As the red light on the right ascends, a dimly lit, curved structure emerges in the top right background, then moves slightly towards the center-right background as the overall perspective shifts. The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view, and it moves forward and to the right, smoothly tracking the subject from above with minimal shaking. The blurred white streaks of headlights on the left move downwards and slightly to the left within the frame. Simultaneously, the red taillights and a yellow roof light on the right move upwards and to the right, with the distance from the headlight streaks gradually increasing. Towards the end of the clip, a dimly lit, curved structure on the far right appears to move downward relative to the frame due to the camera movement, while the lights continue to move upwards and to the right. The video primarily displays the blurred lights of several cars moving in darkness. On the left side, the lights appear as elongated white streaks, representing headlights. On the right side, the red glows represent taillights, and there is also a visible yellow glow on the roof of the car. The cars themselves are not clearly discernible, only their illumination against a very dark background, suggesting a nighttime scene on a road. A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a dark highway at night. Several sets of blurred white headlights, red taillights, and yellow roof lights from moving vehicles are visible against the black road surface.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a dark highway at night. Several sets of blurred white headlights, red taillights, and yellow roof lights from moving vehicles are visible against the black road surface. The surrounding area is predominantly dark, with a dimly lit, curved section of road or an interchange briefly appearing on the right side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
