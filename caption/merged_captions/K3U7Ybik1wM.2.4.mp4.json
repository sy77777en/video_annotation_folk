  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a rustic, country-style kitchen. The video begins with a high-angle view, where a large, dark blue range cooker is centered in the middle ground, flanked by light green cabinets on the left and right, with stone floor tiles occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera is slightly unsteady and begins from a high angle, looking down at the kitchen stove. It then tilts upward, transitioning to a level angle, revealing a backsplash of wavy, white subway tiles and a stainless steel extractor hood in the top center, directly above the cooker in the middle ground, while removing the floor from view. The central focus is the dark blue range cooker with two round, chrome-covered hotplates and a striped tea towel hanging from its handle. The wall behind the stove is covered in a backsplash of white, wavy subway tiles. To the right, a window with a striped Roman blind looks out onto a green lawn. After a brief pause, the camera moves slightly to the right while slightly panning left. The shot is overlaid with post-edited trippy ripple-like effects, which obscure the camera's focus and make it challenging to discern the details clearly. The cooker is set between light green cabinets with curved drawer handles and wooden countertops. The scene centers on the dark blue range cooker set between light-colored cabinets with wooden countertops. The video captures the cozy and well-appointed atmosphere of the kitchen environment itself, with no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the kitchen's ambiance.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, tilts upward in a rustic kitchen during the daytime. The central focus is a large, dark blue range cooker with two round, chrome-covered hotplates and a striped tea towel hanging from its handle. The cooker is set between light green cabinets with curved drawer handles and wooden countertops. The wall behind the stove is covered in a backsplash of white, wavy subway tiles. To the right, a window with a striped Roman blind looks out onto a green lawn. A stainless steel extractor hood is visible above the range, and the floor is made of large, irregular stone tiles.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
