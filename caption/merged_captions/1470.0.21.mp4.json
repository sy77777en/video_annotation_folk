  "merged_caption": "In a static medium shot, a young child with dark, shoulder-length hair and a light complexion sits slightly right of center in the middle ground on a bed, wearing patterned pajamas and a red cowboy hat. The child has a crying facial expression, with their face contorted, eyes teary, and mouth open. The scene is set in a child's bedroom with mid-century modern decor, featuring a wooden spindle headboard on the left and blue and brown plaid bedding. In the background, a geometric art piece hangs above the headboard, while a space-themed art piece is positioned to the right, behind the child. A lamp with a scalloped, yellowish shade occupies the far left of the frame in the middle ground, casting a warm glow throughout the room. A portion of a plaid blanket is visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera, positioned at the child's level from a low, hip-level angle, looks up at the crying child, maintaining a fixed and steady shot with deep focus, keeping the entire room, from the child to the posters on the wall behind them, sharp and clear. The child remains stationary in bed for most of the video, but then extends their left arm and leans their body to the left side. The walls are adorned with two large pieces of art: one featuring abstract geometric shapes in orange, red, and teal on a beige background, and another depicting a stylized solar system with a prominent red circle on a dark blue field. To the right, a window is covered by horizontal blinds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
