  "merged_caption": "This medium full shot initially frames a shirtless man from the thighs up, positioned slightly to the left of center in the lower foreground. He has dark skin, a beard, and short dark hair, and is wearing black shorts with three white vertical stripes on the side. To his right in the middle ground, a man with dark skin and a beard, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, dark blue shorts, and white sneakers, is seen moving to the right side of the scene. In the top right foreground, a basketball hoop with a transparent backboard and a white frame, along with an orange rim, is positioned in front of a large wall mural depicting various athletes in green and yellow uniforms. The background is the mural on the wall of the basketball hall. As the shirtless man prepares to shoot the basketball, the camera, from an unsteady, handheld, eye-level perspective, sweeps in a counterclockwise arc around him, dynamically capturing his repeated dunks. This pan brings a third man with dark skin, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts, holding a basketball, into full view in the bottom left middle ground, while the man in the black shirt moves partially out of the frame. The shirtless man simultaneously drifts to the bottom right foreground, keeping the ball in his hands. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the player and the background mural sharp. The shirtless man catches a pass from the right and shoots the ball, which goes through the hoop. As he releases the first shot, the man in a white t-shirt passes him a second basketball. The shooter catches the second ball and prepares to shoot again by raising his hands. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the action.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
