  "merged_caption": "This full shot begins with two men engaged in a mixed martial arts fight, positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground inside an octagonal cage with a grey mat. The first man is a large, muscular, bald, light-skinned individual wearing black shorts with white designs, bent over the second man, who has short brown hair and is wearing white shorts with black and yellow designs. The octagonal cage, featuring a black chain-link fence and black padded corner posts with \"UFC.COM\" and \"SYNTHA6.COM\" printed vertically in yellow text, surrounds them. The floor is marked with several large, colorful logos, including a partially visible circular orange and white \"GF EFLY.COM\" design, a white \"TAPOUT\" logo, and an orange and black Harley-Davidson shield. The octagon is brightly lit, contrasting with the dimly lit crowd of spectators in the background. Several text and logo overlays are present: a white \"FN\" logo is in the top right, and \"COURTESY: ZUFFA, L.L.C\" is in the bottom right. \"Harley-Davidson.com\" is printed on the left horizontal post. The bald man in black shorts attempts a takedown on the man with brown hair in white shorts. The man in white shorts counters by wrapping his arms around the bald man's torso, lifting him completely off the ground, and then forcefully slamming him onto his back on the mat. As the fighter in white shorts lifts and slams the other fighter, the slightly unsteady camera, from an eye-level perspective, tilts down to follow their movement toward the bottom of the frame, shifting the view from a level to a high angle. The shot ends with the fighters on the mat in the middle ground, as the head and shoulders of a referee enter the foreground from the bottom, partially obscuring the action.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
