  "merged_caption": "This full shot, filmed from a top-down perspective, initially displays two sets of pre-portioned meals on a white surface. The \"MONDAY\" meal is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the \"TUESDAY\" meal is on the right. A yellow sticky note is located at the top left and top right, above each respective meal. The camera, from a bird's-eye view, smoothly moves horizontally from left to right, revealing a series of meal-prepped containers for different days of the week, all kept in deep focus. As it moves, the \"MONDAY\" meal, consisting of a salad with mixed greens, shredded red cabbage, shredded carrots, cashews, sliced chicken breast, and avocado, with a separate container of baby carrots, exits the frame on the left. The \"TUESDAY\" meal, featuring sliced chicken over a bed of grains, accompanied by roasted sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus, with two smaller side containers holding almonds and a white, creamy dip, shifts to the center. A new \"WEDNESDAY\" meal, consisting of two folded white tortillas in one container and a separate container with a filling of chicken and fresh cilantro, along with its corresponding sticky note, enters from the right, coming to rest on the right side of the frame. The camera pans from left to right, revealing each day's food, with yellow sticky notes labeled \"MONDAY,\" \"TUESDAY,\" and \"WEDNESDAY\" identifying the meals. The view starts on a meal labeled \"MONDAY,\" moves to show a \"TUESDAY\" meal, and concludes by revealing a \"WEDNESDAY\" meal. The food and containers remain still throughout the pan.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
