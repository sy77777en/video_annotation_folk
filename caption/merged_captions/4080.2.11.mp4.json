  "merged_caption": "A man is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. He is a Black man with a mustache, wearing a long-sleeved shirt with a green and brown camouflage pattern, which has the words \"I WANA GO HOME\" printed in large white letters across the chest. On his head, he wears a colorful patterned hat, and the bead pattern is part of his pants. The scene is set outdoors in a wooded area with a shallow depth of field, causing the background of bare trees to be heavily blurred. The environment is cast in a cool, blue-green light, suggesting an overcast day or dusk. The man sits with his eyes closed, tilting his head backward while his mouth moves as he sings. The camera moves smoothly forward, panning slightly to the left and tilting upward to transition from a level to a low-angle perspective on the man. This hip-level shot effectively uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in sharp focus. Post-processing techniques enhance this effect by significantly blurring the background and parts of the man's knit beanie. In the background, blurred trees are visible.",

The environment is cast in a cool, blue-green light, suggesting an overcast day or dusk. A person wearing a camouflage-patterned shirt and a dark, patterned beanie is seated in the foreground. The shirt has the words \"I WANA GO HOME\" printed in white capital letters across the chest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
