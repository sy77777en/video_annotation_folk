  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a White-crowned Lapwing, a type of wader bird, initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, within the middle ground. The bird, with a grey head and neck, a distinct white patch on its crown, a bright yellow beak, and a prominent yellow wattle at the base of the beak, stands in a muddy area with shallow puddles. Its back and upper wings are brownish-grey, with a visible black band on the folded wing, bordered by white, and its underparts are white. It has long, slender, pale-colored legs. The ground is composed of thick, brown mud with uneven surfaces and small puddles of murky, light-brown water. The mud appears wet and clumpy. The bird is surrounded by this thick, brown mud that fills the foreground, middle ground, and background, with a prominent puddle of murky water occupying the center middle ground. As the video progresses, the White-crowned Lapwing begins to walk deliberately through the mud, lifting its long, slender legs with each step, moving from the center-left towards the center-right of the frame, maintaining its full shot framing and middle ground position. The camera is positioned at a high angle, utilizing deep focus to keep both the bird and its muddy surroundings sharp. It smoothly trucks right, tracking the bird as it walks, and moves forward slightly towards the end to follow its movement. Due to the camera movements, the bird ends up in the bottom-left of the frame. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout the scene, capturing the outdoor environment under daylight.",

    "Scene": "The video shows a muddy, outdoor environment under daylight. The ground is composed of thick, brown mud with uneven surfaces and small puddles of murky, light-brown water.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
