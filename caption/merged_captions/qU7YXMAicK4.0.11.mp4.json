  "merged_caption": "A full shot displays a large, yellow pumpkin positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A green vine, attached to the pumpkin, extends from the center towards the left before curving down and exiting the frame on the left. To the right of the pumpkin, a green baseball cap with a circular logo featuring an orange image and white text rests in the bottom-right middle ground. Both objects sit on a rough wooden table that fills the bottom portion of the frame. The background consists of white fabric walls, with a thin wooden stick leaning against the wall in the center. The camera is stationary and positioned slightly higher than the pumpkin, capturing the scene from a static, high-angle perspective and maintaining a deep focus to ensure both the pumpkin and its surroundings are clear. The video features a time-lapse of the large yellow pumpkin and the green baseball cap on the wooden surface, with the pumpkin gradually increasing in size throughout the clip. The pumpkin is still attached to a thick, dark green vine that extends out of view. The setting appears to be a tent or temporary structure, providing a controlled environment for the time-lapse.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a static, high-angle perspective, looking down at a very large yellow pumpkin. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring both the pumpkin and its surroundings are clear.",
    "Subject": "A very large, oblong, yellow pumpkin with prominent vertical ribs rests on a wooden surface. The pumpkin is still attached to a thick, green vine that extends from its stem and curves behind it to the left. To the right of the pumpkin sits a dark green baseball cap, which has a circular logo on the front featuring an orange image and white text.",
    "Motion": "The video features a time-lapse of a large yellow pumpkin and a green baseball cap on a wooden surface, with the pumpkin gradually increasing in size throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "A massive, oblong, yellow pumpkin with prominent vertical ribs rests on a rough wooden table inside what appears to be a tent or temporary structure with white fabric walls. A thick, dark green vine is still attached to the pumpkin and extends out of view. For scale, a dark green baseball cap with a logo is placed on the table next to the large gourd. A thin wooden stick leans against the back wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
