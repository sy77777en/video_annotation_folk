  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot, a man in camouflage clothing and a matching beanie is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, behind a large, deceased male deer that lies in the foreground, occupying the lower half of the frame from the bottom left to the bottom right. The man, who has a dark beard, briefly uses his left hand to wipe his nose, then lowers his hand from his face and slightly sways before remaining still, looking directly at the camera and talking. A black compound bow with an attached quiver holding several arrows with white and green fletching rests against the deer's body in the center of the frame. The deer, which has brown fur, a lighter-colored snout, and a large rack of antlers, is lying on its side on the ground. The background consists of a line of evergreen trees and a rocky outcrop that extends across the upper portion of the frame. The scene is set in a rugged, outdoor environment under a white, overcast sky, with the ground covered in dry, brown grass and dark rocks. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a deep focus to ensure both the hunter with the deer in the foreground and the trees in the background are in sharp detail. However, the camera is quite unsteady, exhibiting slight, patternless movement.",

    "Camera": "From a level, ground-level perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring both the hunter with the deer in the foreground and the trees in the background are in sharp detail. The camera is quite unsteady, exhibiting slight, patternless movement.",
    "Subject": "A man in camouflage clothing and a matching beanie kneels behind a large, deceased male deer. The man has a dark beard and is looking at the camera. The deer, which has brown fur, a lighter-colored snout, and a large rack of antlers, is lying on its side on the ground. A black compound bow with an attached quiver holding several arrows with white and green fletching rests against the deer's body.",
    "Motion": "A man in camouflage uses his left hand to wipe his nose, then lowers his hand from his face and slightly sways before remaining still, looking toward the camera and talking. The deceased deer and the surrounding environment remain motionless.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a rugged, outdoor environment under a white, overcast sky. A man in camouflage kneels on the ground, which is covered in dry, brown grass and dark rocks. In front of him lies a large, deceased buck with prominent antlers. A black compound bow with arrows is propped against the animal's side. The background consists of a line of evergreen trees and a rocky outcrop. The man briefly touches his face before looking towards the camera.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
