  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, level-angle scenery shot captured from the bow of a container ship, showcasing a stunning seascape scenery at night. The foreground is composed of stacked shipping containers in various colors, including red, blue, and beige, occupying the bottom one-third of the frame and extending from the bottom edge toward the center of the middle ground. The sea fills the middle ground and stretches to the horizon line in the background. The night sky, densely packed with brilliant stars, occupies the top half of the frame, revealing the faint, glowing band of the Milky Way and a distinct constellation. A timelapse sequence shows the stars across the sky, with the trajectory of a flying object moving from the right to the upper left corner. A bright orange glow from a distant city is visible on the right horizon, with a fainter white light on the left horizon. The video is shot from a high position on top of a container, between an overhead and aerial level, with a level angle. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera moves quickly and smoothly forward while simultaneously panning to the left, capturing the scene of sailing at sea. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the containers in the foreground to the starry sky and distant horizon, sharp and clear. Overlaying the center-right side of the scene are two white watermarks, \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK,\" each accompanied by an icon to their left. The focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the tranquil atmosphere of a night at sea, rather than on any single subject.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a stunning seascape scenery shot from the perspective of a large container ship navigating the open ocean. The focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the tranquil atmosphere of a night at sea, rather than on any single subject. The extreme wide view from the bow, looking over stacks of colorful shipping containers, leads the eye across the dark blue, calm water to the distant horizon. Above, the deep night sky is densely packed with brilliant stars, revealing the faint, glowing band of the Milky Way and a distinct constellation, while a warm, orange light from a far-off city illuminates the horizon to the right.",
    "Motion": "This stunning scenery shot is captured from the bow of a container ship sailing on the open ocean at night. The wide-angle view looks forward over stacks of shipping containers towards a breathtaking, star-filled sky, with the glow of a distant city visible on the horizon. The video is a timelapse, which captures the scene of sailing at sea.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the scene looks out over a calm, dark blue sea at night. The vast night sky is a deep blue, filled with a multitude of stars in a timelapse sequence. An orange glow from a distant light source illuminates the horizon on the right, while a fainter white light is visible on the left. In the foreground, rows of stacked shipping containers in various colors, including red, blue, and beige, cover the deck of the vessel. Overlaying the center-right side of the scene are two white watermarks, \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK,\" each accompanied by an icon to their left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
