  "merged_caption": "This full shot frames a stop-motion puppet of a woman with dark skin standing in the center of the middle ground, holding a small woven basket in the crook of her right arm. She wears a patterned, short-sleeved dress, her dark hair is pulled back, and her eyes are closed with a slight smile on her face. In the right middle ground, a child puppet with dark hair, wearing a purple dress, is seated on the floor with their back to the camera, looking toward the woman. Another puppet, a person with dark curly hair wearing a light-colored, plain shirt, is partially visible standing in the background to the left of the woman. The scene is set within a dimly lit and cluttered indoor space, characteristic of a stop-motion animation. The room is filled with an assortment of objects, with wooden shelves on the right stacked high with numerous woven baskets of various shapes and sizes. A small, colorful, tiered object rests on an upper shelf. In the background, colorful clothing, including yellow and purple garments, hangs near a doorway. The left side of the room contains stacked metal pots and pans. The overall environment has an earthy feel, with rough-textured walls and floors. Light enters from an opening in the background, casting the foreground, which is filled with out-of-focus household items, into shadow. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, using a static, hip-level shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the midground. The woman stands in a doorway and raises her left hand, signaling to the child puppet in the foreground to stay at home as she departs. Meanwhile, another puppet is seen walking out of the house in the background.",

She wears a patterned, short-sleeved dress and holds a small woven basket in the crook of her right arm. Her dark hair is pulled back, and her eyes are closed with a slight smile on her face. In the foreground, with her back to the viewer, a small child puppet with dark hair sits on the floor wearing a purple dress, looking toward the woman.

    "Spatial": "This full shot frames a woman standing in the center of the middle ground, holding a small basket. In the right middle ground, a child is seated on the floor with their back to the camera. Another person is partially visible standing in the background, to the left of the woman. The scene is framed by out-of-focus household items across the left foreground and middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
