  "merged_caption": "From a fixed position in the center of the back seat, the video presents a medium shot of the driver from behind, a person with short, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, positioned in the right-hand seat of a light-colored station wagon. The two front seats with black headrests and the driver occupy the middle ground, framing the central view. The car's grey interior, including the dashboard and center console, is visible below the windshield. The background, seen through the front windshield, is filled with a forward view of the road, where another dark-colored vehicle travels ahead in the center. The urban or suburban scenery visible through the side windows is blurred, indicating the car's rapid forward motion, which creates a time-lapse effect. The camera is mounted inside the vehicle at the driver's level, following its quick forward movement from behind, with slight pans to the left and right at the start. The shot is slightly unsteady with some shaking, but a deep focus keeps the entire scene, both inside and outside the car, sharp. Through the front window, the car travels along a paved road with other vehicles ahead, while concrete barriers line the road. The environment appears to be urban or suburban, and the scenery in the side windows is blurred due to motion. A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead from inside a moving car during the daytime. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a white logo.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from an eye-level, level angle from the back seat of a car. The camera is mounted inside the vehicle, following its quick forward movement from behind, with slight pans to the left and right at the start. The shot is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, both inside and outside the car, sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a viewpoint in the back seat, a person with short, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, is seen from behind while driving a car. The driver is positioned in the right-hand seat of the light-colored station wagon. The car's grey interior is visible, including the two front seats with black headrests, the dashboard, and the center console. Through the front windshield, another dark-colored vehicle can be seen driving ahead.",
    "Motion": "From a fixed perspective in the back seat, a car travels forward along a road. The scenery seen through the side and front windows blurs past, indicating the vehicle's forward motion. Another car is visible through the windshield, also driving ahead in the same direction.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead from inside a moving car during the daytime. The dark headrests of the two front seats frame the view of the grey dashboard and the windshield, where a silhouetted person is visible in the driver's seat of the right-hand drive vehicle. Through the front window, the car travels along a paved road with other vehicles ahead, while the scenery in the side windows is blurred due to motion. The environment appears to be urban or suburban, with concrete barriers lining the road. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a white logo.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
