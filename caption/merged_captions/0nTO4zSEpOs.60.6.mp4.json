  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide, level-angle shot of a bustling city intersection at night in Shibuya, Tokyo. In the middle ground, a prominent red and white bus with Japanese characters is positioned in the bottom left next to a small white truck, while a line of dark-colored cars, likely taxis, is queued on the right side of the road. Illuminated high-rise buildings, including the dark-paneled Tokyu Plaza on the left, occupy the background, surrounded by bright interior lights and large digital billboards displaying Japanese characters. The camera begins with a stationary, level-angle view, then smoothly pans to the left, revealing a pedestrian bridge, and accelerates its left pan while simultaneously moving forward along the elevated pedestrian walkway. This eye-level, slightly unsteady shot captures the perspective of someone walking, with the grey tiled floor and metal railings of the walkway extending from the foreground to the background. A pedestrian in a light blue shirt walks from right to left, while other pedestrians walk forward in the middle ground. Below the walkway, traffic, including red and white buses and a queue of taxis, moves through the complex road system. The camera continues to move forward at a walking pace, with the city buildings now framing the scene from the left and right. The area is filled with numerous pedestrians walking along the bridge and on the sidewalks below, while the streets are filled with vehicles. The watermark for 'VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV' is positioned in the bottom left corner.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, slightly unsteady shot captures a bustling urban nightscape in deep focus. The camera begins with a smooth pan to the left, revealing a pedestrian bridge, and then accelerates its left pan while simultaneously moving forward along the bridge with an unsteady motion that resembles the perspective of someone walking.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a bustling city scene at night from an elevated walkway. Numerous pedestrians are seen walking along the bridge and on the sidewalks below. The streets are filled with vehicles, including a prominent red and white bus with Japanese characters on its side, visible in the lower left next to a small white truck. On the right side of the road, a long line of dark-colored cars, likely taxis, and other buses are queued up.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a stationary, level-angle view of a city intersection at night, with traffic moving on the streets below. The camera then pans to the left and moves forward along an elevated pedestrian walkway. As it advances, people walk past in both directions on the walkway, while cars and buses continue to drive on the street level.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a bustling urban scene in Shibuya, Tokyo, at night. The view begins from a high vantage point overlooking a busy bus terminal before transitioning to a walk along an elevated pedestrian skywalk. The area is surrounded by modern high-rise buildings, including the dark-paneled Tokyu Plaza, which are illuminated by bright interior lights and large digital billboards displaying Japanese characters. Below the walkway, which has a grey tiled floor and metal railings, traffic including red and white buses and a queue of taxis moves through the complex road system. Other pedestrians can be seen walking along the skywalk. A watermark for 'VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV' is positioned in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with an extreme wide, level-angle shot of a city intersection at night. In the middle ground, a bus is positioned in the bottom left, while a line of dark cars is queued on the right side of the road. Illuminated high-rise buildings, including the Tokyu Plaza on the left, occupy the background. The camera then pans left and moves forward, transitioning into a wide, eye-level shot from the perspective of someone walking on an elevated pedestrian walkway. In this new frame, the walkway and its railing extend from the foreground to the background, with a pedestrian in a light blue shirt walking from right to left. Other pedestrians walk forward in the middle ground, while the street with traffic is now visible below to the left. The camera continues to move forward at a walking pace, with the city buildings now framing the scene from the left and right. An italicized watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" is present in the bottom left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
