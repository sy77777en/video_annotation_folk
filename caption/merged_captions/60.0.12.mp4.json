  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on a person positioned in the middle ground on a sunlit, green soccer field. This individual, wearing a light blue short-sleeved shirt with the number 9, light blue shorts, light blue athletic shoes, and purple knee-high sports socks, is actively engaged with a white soccer ball that has orange markings, which is on the ground to the right of them. As the person performs a soccer trick, they run forward, swinging their right leg up and around the moving ball in a quick, fluid arc. The camera, starting at a high angle, tracks the soccer player by trucking and panning to the right while tilting up slightly, transitioning to a level angle. As the person moves around the ball, it shifts to their left, and the camera pulls back, transitioning to a full shot that reveals the person's entire body and more of the surrounding field. The unsteady camera follows the player's forward movement and slightly tilts upward, capturing their entire body. The out-of-focus background remains visible, suggesting an open outdoor space with distant greenery. The person's dark shadow stretches across the turf as they interact with the ball. Due to the video's low resolution, the focus is difficult to determine.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a person on a green field performing a soccer trick. This individual wears a light blue short-sleeved shirt with the number 9, light blue shorts, light blue athletic shoes, and purple knee-high sports socks. They are actively engaged with a white soccer ball that has orange markings, which remains on the ground as they skillfully maneuver around it.",
    "Motion": "A person on a green field performs a soccer trick over a moving ball. Running forward, they swing their right leg up and around the ball in a quick, fluid arc.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on a sunlit, green soccer field. A person is captured in motion, their dark shadow stretching across the turf as they interact with a white and orange soccer ball. The background is out of focus, suggesting an open outdoor space with distant greenery.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
