  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, captured from a high-angle perspective at dusk. The shot begins with the camera descending and rotating rapidly, creating a disorienting, blurred view of the city below in the bottom right and the sunset sky in the top left. The sky is painted with soft orange and pink hues from the setting sun. As the camera dives, it swoops over a large urban construction site that moves from the background to occupy the foreground and center of the frame. A tall red crane is briefly visible on the left side of the frame, while partially constructed buildings in the middle ground and foreground rush past. The drone performs a complex mid-air stunt, flying forward while simultaneously rolling clockwise and turning right, creating a dynamic, varying Dutch angle. This motion, combined with noticeable fisheye distortion, transforms city lights into dynamic streaks, preventing any single building or object from becoming the main subject. Instead, the focus is on conveying the exhilarating and vertiginous experience of flying through the vast, developing urban landscape. The ground below is a mix of dirt, building materials, and the foundations of new structures. The rapid, swooping motion of the camera creates significant motion blur, emphasizing the scale and energy of the environment. In the background, the lights of the surrounding city skyline begin to twinkle against the fading light. The camera's fast, continuous movement prevents any single element from remaining static, with the entire scene shifting dynamically from a high-angle, top-down view to a more level, though still elevated, perspective flying through the construction area. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire cityscape sharp.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, aerial drone shot featuring noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera performs a complex mid-air stunt over the city at dusk, flying forward while simultaneously rolling clockwise and turning right. This motion creates a dynamic, varying Dutch angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire cityscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a fast-paced, disorienting aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dense urban environment at dusk. The sky is painted with soft orange and pink hues above a skyline of illuminated skyscrapers and buildings under construction. A large construction site is a prominent feature below, characterized by a tall red crane, exposed earth, and the skeletal frames of new structures. The rapid, swooping motion of the camera creates significant motion blur, transforming city lights into dynamic streaks and preventing any single building or object from becoming the main subject. Instead, the focus is on conveying the exhilarating and vertiginous experience of flying through the vast, developing urban landscape, emphasizing the scale and energy of the environment.",
    "Motion": "This fast-moving video provides an aerial shot from a drone of a city at dusk. The scene captures a dense urban environment with numerous skyscrapers and buildings under construction, evidenced by large cranes. The warm colors of the sunset are visible in the sky as the city lights begin to illuminate the landscape below.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-paced, swooping flight over a large urban construction site at dusk. The sky is painted with hues of orange and pink from the setting sun. The drone dives and maneuvers around partially constructed high-rise buildings and a prominent red construction crane. In the background, the lights of the surrounding city skyline begin to twinkle against the fading light. The ground below is a mix of dirt, building materials, and the foundations of new structures.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
