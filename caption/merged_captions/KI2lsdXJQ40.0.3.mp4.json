  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, laid flat in the center of the frame, with the camera directly above at a top-down angle. The underwear occupies the central area both horizontally and vertically, with the wooden floor filling the background. The floor is made of horizontal wooden planks painted in a pale, weathered white with visible grain and subtle gaps between the boards. The lighting is even and natural, suggesting daytime. The gray and white underwear is first laid flat, then it is rolled up tightly so that the waistband forms a visible stripe along the length of the roll. As the underwear is rolled up, it transitions to the bottom center-right of the frame as the camera moves smoothly forward, maintaining a deep focus and a bird's-eye view. As the scene progresses, two additional objects—a pair of white underwear and a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe—enter the frame from the top edge, moving into the center. Each new item is initially laid flat in the center, then rolled up in place, moving down to the bottom of the frame as the camera moves. The white underwear and t-shirt are manipulated from their original flat shape into compact, cylindrical rolls, with the blue stripe on the t-shirt visible along the roll. The camera remains above the subjects for all transitions, and the shot size stays consistent as a full shot for each main subject, with no significant changes in camera height or angle. The scene remains uncluttered with a focus on the central objects and the textured wooden surface, and no overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a bird's-eye view. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp as it moves smoothly forward over the scene. Due to the absence of background information, it is difficult to determine the camera's height in the video.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, which appears to be made of soft fabric and is laid flat. The underwear then transitions into a rolled-up form, with the blue waistband now forming a visible stripe along the length of the roll. As the camera moves, two other objects appear and also roll up: one is a pair of white underwear, and the other is a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe. The transition between the subjects occurs as each item is manipulated from its original flat shape into a compact, cylindrical roll, highlighting the change in form and orientation.",
    "Motion": "The gray and white underwear with a blue waistband is first laid flat, then it is rolled up tightly so that the waistband forms a visible stripe along the length of the roll. Next, a pair of white underwear is shown flat and is also rolled into a compact cylinder. Finally, a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe is laid out and then rolled up in a similar manner, resulting in a cylindrical shape with the blue stripe visible along the roll.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors on a floor made of horizontal wooden planks painted in a pale, weathered white with visible grain and subtle gaps between the boards. The lighting is even and natural, suggesting daytime. A small, soft fabric object, identified as a piece of gray underwear with a white band featuring a blue stripe, is present, initially laid out flat and later shown rolled into a compact cylindrical shape. The fabric has a slightly fuzzy texture, and its edges are neatly finished. As the camera moves, two additional objects appear: a white piece of underwear and a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe. These objects are also initially laid out flat and gradually roll up. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present, and the scene remains uncluttered with a focus on the central objects and the textured wooden surface.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a full shot of a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, laid flat in the center of the frame, with the camera directly above at a top-down angle. The underwear occupies the central area both horizontally and vertically, with the wooden floor filling the background. As the underwear is rolled up, it transitions to the bottom center-right of the frame as the camera moves, changing from a flat, rectangular shape to a compact, cylindrical form, with the blue waistband forming a visible stripe along the roll. The camera maintains its top-down perspective and height throughout this transition. As the scene progresses, two additional objects—a pair of white underwear and a white t-shirt with a blue stripe—enter the frame from the top edge, moving into the center. Each new item is initially laid flat in the center, then rolled up in place, moving down to the bottom of the frame as the camera moves. The camera remains above the subjects for all transitions, and the shot size stays consistent as a full shot for each main subject, with no significant changes in camera height or angle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
