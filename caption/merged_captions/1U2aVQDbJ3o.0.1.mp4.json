  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a sweeping view of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, highlighting the vast expanse of undulating sand dunes in shades of golden brown. The camera begins with a bird's-eye view, featuring overlay text \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates\" centrally placed, which quickly transitions to other text before disappearing. The camera smoothly spirals down counterclockwise while tilting up slightly, transitioning to a high-angle shot with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. A winding road cuts through the scene, and an off-road vehicle is seen driving along it, creating a trail of dust. The vehicle appears small against the immense desert landscape, emphasizing the contrast between the vehicle and the expansive desert. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, enhancing visual engagement as the subject becomes larger in the frame. The vehicle continues to move forward, navigating the curves of the road, with the dust trail becoming more pronounced. The setting is outdoors, likely midday, as the sunlight casts distinct shadows on the dunes, highlighting their curves and textures. The sand is a warm, golden-brown color, with smooth surfaces and occasional ridges. The camera maintains its focus on the vehicle, capturing its movement and the dust trail it creates as it progresses along the road, emphasizing motion within the otherwise still desert environment. The dynamic camera movement and the vehicle's motion create a temporally coherent narrative, showcasing the vastness and beauty of the Liwa Desert.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera starting with a bird's-eye view, transitioning to a high angle as it tracks a car. The camera smoothly spirals down counterclockwise, tilting up slightly, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is smooth and steady, enhancing the visual engagement as the subject becomes larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes in shades of golden brown. A prominent feature is a winding road cutting through the dunes. An off-road vehicle is seen traveling along this road, creating a trail of dust as it moves. The car appears small in comparison to the expansive desert.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, showing the winding road and the surrounding sand dunes. The text 'LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates' appears on the screen and then fades away. The camera smoothly spirals down counterclockwise while tilting up slightly, following the off-road vehicle as it drives along the path, leaving a trail of dust behind it. The vehicle continues to move forward, navigating the curves of the road, with the dust trail becoming more pronounced. The camera maintains its focus on the vehicle, capturing its movement and the dust trail it creates as it progresses along the road.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV shot, showcases the vast expanse of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates. The setting is outdoors, featuring sweeping views of undulating sand dunes with a winding road cutting through the landscape. The time of day is likely midday, as the sunlight casts distinct shadows on the dunes, highlighting their curves and textures. The sand is a warm, golden-brown color, with smooth surfaces and occasional ridges. A vehicle is seen traveling along the road, leaving a trail of dust behind, emphasizing motion within the otherwise still desert environment. Initially, overlay text displays \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates,\" centrally placed over the scene, which quickly transitions to other white text before eventually disappearing.",
    "Spatial": "The video showcases a sweeping view of the Liwa Desert, highlighting the vast expanse of undulating sand dunes. The camera begins with a bird's-eye view and continuously rotates counterclockwise while moving downward and tilting upward, transitioning to a high-angle shot. A winding road cuts through the scene, and an off-road vehicle is seen driving along it, creating a trail of dust. The vehicle appears small against the immense desert landscape. Overlay text \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates\" is initially centered in the frame but quickly changes to other text before disappearing. The dynamic camera movement emphasizes the contrast between the vehicle and the expansive desert."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
