  "merged_caption": "From a moving, wide-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is viewed through a wooden structure that creates a frame-within-a-frame, with dark vertical supports on the left and right. In the foreground, a chainsaw's rotating chain moves vertically downwards, cutting through a horizontal, light-colored wooden beam. As the chain cuts, the beam splinters and separates in the center of the frame, creating a jagged separation and sending sawdust flying through the air. The camera, shot from a level angle with mild barrel distortion, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The unsteady camera moves downward, following the electric saw as it cuts through the wooden plank. The motion's speed corresponds to the cutting action: slow while the saw is engaged with the wood and quick as it moves to the next plank. Through the structure, a paved industrial lot with yellow lines on the asphalt and a gray ramp extending towards industrial-style buildings and a blue fence are visible in the middle ground. In the background, a hill range is visible under a partly cloudy sky. A black object is fixed in the bottom foreground of the shot.",

    "Camera": "Shot from a level angle, this video features mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The unsteady camera moves downward, following an electric saw as it cuts through wooden planks. The motion's speed corresponds to the cutting action: slow while the saw is engaged with the wood and quick as it moves to the next plank.",
    "Subject": "From a locked-on POV, wide-angle perspective, a chainsaw's moving, toothed chain is visible as it cuts vertically through a horizontal, light-colored wooden beam. The beam is part of a larger wooden frame held together by dark vertical supports. As the cut progresses, the wood splinters and breaks apart, creating a jagged separation and sending sawdust flying through the air.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on POV perspective, a chainsaw's rotating chain moves vertically downwards, cutting through a horizontal wooden beam. As the saw progresses, the beam splinters and breaks apart, creating a jagged separation and sending sawdust flying through the air.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot captures a chainsaw blade cutting through a horizontal wooden plank, which is part of a larger wooden frame held by black vertical supports. The scene is set outdoors during the day in a paved industrial lot with yellow lines on the asphalt. In the distance, a long gray ramp extends towards industrial-style buildings and a blue fence. A hill range is visible under a partly cloudy sky. As the chainsaw cuts, wood splinters and dust fly through the air.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
