  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective seen through a red-rimmed visor, the camera initially looks down at a sandy seabed occupying the bottom-left and center of the frame in the middle ground. A large school of white, dot-like bioluminescent organisms is positioned in the middle ground on the right, bordering a dark abyss that fills the background in the top-right. Some of the dot-like bioluminescent organisms quickly pass by the foreground. The camera then moves forward, briefly tilts up to a level angle, then ascends before descending, gliding over the edge of an underwater cliff. As it descends, the seabed on the left recedes, and the dark abyss expands to fill the majority of the frame. A pair of red and black gloved hands occasionally enters the frame from the bottom, positioned in the foreground. The camera continues its descent into the dark abyss, with various clusters of green and white bioluminescent organisms scattered throughout the middle ground. Some small, red-glowing creatures swim to the right as the view moves deeper into the abyss. The underwater camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the seafloor, and then transitions to a level angle as it follows the player's descent, ascent, and subsequent descent through the water. The camera maintains a variable Dutch angle due to rolling. It appears that the elements in the background are slightly more blurred than those in the foreground. However, due to the darkness, movement, and low resolution, it is difficult to confirm this. Camera movement is smooth and continuous, simulating the player's forward swimming motion—initially moving downward, then upward, and then downward again as the player changes direction. At the end, the camera pans right while simultaneously trucking left. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective seen through a red-rimmed visor, the video shows a descent into a dark, underwater abyss. The scene is illuminated by large schools of bioluminescent organisms. One type appears as dense clusters of small, bright white dots, while another group consists of larger, leaf-shaped creatures with glowing green outlines. Below, a sandy seabed is visible, populated by schools of small, dark, fish-like creatures, along with plants and rocks. As the viewpoint moves forward, a pair of red and black gloved hands appears at the bottom of the screen, and a kind of fish-like creature with a small, red, glowing top is swimming around this area.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the viewpoint glides forward and descends into a dark, underwater abyss. It moves over a sandy slope, passing drifting schools of bioluminescent organisms. During the diver's forward movement, many drifting schools of bioluminescent organisms can be seen, and the gloved hands in the foreground move from the center towards the sides. As the video progresses, a pair of gloved hands occasionally appears at the bottom of the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a descent into a dark, alien ocean. The view, framed by the reddish-orange border of a visor, glides over a sandy, greenish-brown seafloor dotted with dark rock formations and patches of underwater flora. Large schools of small, bioluminescent organisms illuminate the dark water, some appearing as bright cyan points of light and others as glowing, leaf-shaped creatures. The perspective moves down a steep underwater cliff into a much deeper and darker abyss, with the character's gloved hands occasionally visible at the bottom of the frame. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
