  "merged_caption": "A medium, high-angle shot centers on a toilet in the middle ground, viewed from directly above. The toilet features a modern design with a smooth, white surface and an open lid. Inside the bowl, a glowing blue light is positioned in the center, possibly indicating water or a cleaning agent. The camera continuously moves to the right while rotating counterclockwise, maintaining focus on the toilet in the midground using a shallow depth of field. To the left of the toilet, in the middle ground, are a roll of toilet paper attached to a reflective wall, with its reflection visible. Additionally, there appears to be a cylindrical holder for a toilet bowl brush on the right side of the toilet. A white text overlay lists three types of toilets: \"Pull chain toilet,\" \"Washdown toilet,\" and \"Washout toilet,\" with lines connecting the phrases. The scene is set in a monochromatic, gray environment, and the video highlights the toilet's functionality.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
