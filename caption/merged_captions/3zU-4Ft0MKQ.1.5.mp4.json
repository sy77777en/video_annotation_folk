  "merged_caption": "This shot is composed with significant depth, placing subjects across multiple planes. In the foreground on the left, the back and side of a man with dark hair are visible as he aims a large, dark, military-style weapon, which emits a bright muzzle flash and sparks toward the background. Bright orange flames occupy the bottom-left corner of the foreground, partially obscuring the shooter. In the middle ground, positioned on the bottom-right, is the top of a bald man's head adorned with a shiny, gold, conical party hat. The muzzle flash and sparks travel from the middle ground toward the background. On the right background, a man with a light-to-medium skin tone, short dark hair, and a goatee, wearing a gray t-shirt with a colorful graphic, stands framed within a doorway, his upper body visible. He reacts with his hands raised and mouth open in an expression of shock. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It trucks left throughout the shot, with a slight pan to the right to keep the man firing the weapon in the frame. The indoor scene is set within a room, looking towards a hallway in the background, illuminated by a single wall-mounted light fixture. The man in the foreground fires the weapon, creating a dynamic contrast with the motionless figures: the shocked man in the doorway and the individual with the party hat.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera trucks left throughout the shot, with a slight pan to the right to keep the man firing the weapon in the frame.",
    "Subject": "In an indoor setting, a man with dark hair, seen from the back and side, is firing a large, dark, military-style weapon, which is emitting a muzzle flash and sparks. Bright orange flames are visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the shooter. In the background, standing in a doorway, a man with a light-to-medium skin tone, short dark hair, and a goatee reacts with his hands raised and his mouth open in an expression of shock. He is wearing a gray t-shirt with a colorful graphic on it. In the middle ground, the top of a bald man's head is visible, adorned with a shiny, gold, conical party hat.",
    "Motion": "A man in the foreground fires a large weapon, creating a muzzle flash and sparks. In the background, another man stands frozen in a doorway with his hands raised and mouth open. A third person wearing a party hat is positioned in the middle ground, with flames in the foreground, all completely motionless.",
    "Scene": "This indoor scene is set within a room, looking towards a hallway in the background. The hallway is illuminated by a single wall-mounted light fixture, where a man stands in the doorway with his arms raised. In the foreground, a person aims a large, dark weapon, from which a bright muzzle flash and sparks erupt toward the man in the doorway. A large, bright orange flame is visible in the bottom left corner. Between the person with the weapon and the hallway, another individual is seen wearing a gold, conical party hat.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
