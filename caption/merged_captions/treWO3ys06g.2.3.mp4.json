  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, two people on a dark-colored motorcycle with an orange or reddish-brown seat are initially positioned in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. One individual is wearing a white long-sleeved top, light-colored pants, and a dark helmet, while the other person is wearing a black jacket with light-colored pants, has long hair, and is not wearing a helmet. They are on a paved road that stretches horizontally across the lower portion of the scene, with a grassy area in the foreground and a dense forest directly behind them in the middle ground. A large, sparsely vegetated mountain rises above the dense forests of dark green trees that line the lower slopes in the background. The road is bordered by grassy verges and a simple wire fence on one side, with patches of reddish-brown foliage and lines of trees on the other side. Under a grey, overcast sky, the motorcycle travels from right to left along the winding road in a hilly, forested area. The camera, initially at a level angle, trucks left and moves forward to follow the motorcycle from the side. As the motorcycle navigates a curve, the camera simultaneously moves upward and tilts downward while advancing forward, transitioning to a high-angle perspective from behind and above. This dynamic camera movement tracks the motorcycle, keeping it in the bottom half of the frame as it rounds a curve, while revealing more of the expansive, hilly terrain. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, as the drone captures the scene, revealing more of the road and the surrounding landscape.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth aerial shot tracking a person on a motorcycle. Initially at a level angle, the camera trucks left and moves forward to follow the subject from the side. As the motorcycle travels along the winding road, the camera simultaneously moves upward and tilts downward while advancing forward, transitioning to a high-angle perspective from behind and above. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "Two people are riding a motorcycle. One individual is wearing a white long-sleeved top, light-colored pants, and a dark helmet. The other person is wearing a black jacket with light-colored pants, has long hair, and is not wearing a helmet. The motorcycle is a dark color, possibly black, with an orange or reddish-brown seat.",
    "Motion": "From an aerial view, two people on a motorcycle travel from right to left along a winding road in a hilly, forested area. The camera follows the motorcycle as it navigates a curve.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a winding, paved road cutting through a remote, mountainous landscape under a grey, overcast sky. In the background, a large, sparsely vegetated mountain rises above dense forests of dark green trees that line the lower slopes. The damp road is bordered by grassy verges and a simple wire fence on one side, with patches of reddish-brown foliage and lines of trees on the other side. As a lone motorcycle travels along the road, the drone ascends and tilts downward while continuing to move forward to track the motorcycle's movement around a curve, revealing more of the expansive, hilly terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
