  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide, top-down aerial scenery shot of a roof under construction, filmed by a drone during the daytime. Initially, the new OSB-paneled roof occupies the majority of the frame in the top left middle ground, characterized by its wood chip texture and rectangular panels. A ladder is positioned in the bottom left, leaning against the roof, while a yellow power tool sits on the ground in the bottom center. Green grass is visible in the background on the right side of the frame, along with a portion of a chain-link fence. The camera, positioned directly above the scene, maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. It glides smoothly forward, revealing a safety harness, yellow extension cords, and ropes in the top left of the frame on the roof, along with various construction items scattered around. As the camera continues to move, it captures a worker's equipment and tools placed on the roof, and some tree branches in the foreground can be seen on the left side of the frame. This movement transitions the view entirely to an older, weathered wooden roof, which fills the middle ground and the foreground of the frame. The older section of the roof is composed of dark brown planks, showing signs of age with gaps between the boards and remnants of black roofing material, possibly indicating water damage. The camera's top-down perspective and movement emphasize the textures, materials, and overall state of the different roof surfaces, highlighting the contrast between new construction and aged structures rather than a specific focal point.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from an aerial, bird's-eye view. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward, providing a clear view of the roof under construction.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an aerial scenery shot, initially focusing on a roof under construction, characterized by light brown oriented strand board (OSB) panels, some marked with blue chalk lines, and construction equipment like a ladder, a yellow power tool, and a safety harness. The camera then transitions to reveal an older, weathered wooden roof composed of dark brown planks, showing signs of age with gaps between the boards and remnants of black roofing material. There is no main subject as the camera's top-down perspective and movement emphasize the textures, materials, and overall state of the different roof surfaces, highlighting the contrast between new construction and aged structures rather than a specific focal point.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a roof under construction, showing plywood sheets, a ladder, and various tools on the ground. The camera moves forward, revealing more of the roof and construction materials scattered around. As the camera continues to move, it shows a worker's equipment and tools placed on the roof. The camera then captures ropes and wooden planks on the roof, indicating ongoing construction work. The camera moves further, showing the transition from the newly installed plywood to the old, weathered wooden roof structure. The old wooden roof, with visible wear and tear, is shown in detail as the camera continues to move.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a bird's-eye perspective of a roof undergoing construction or repair during the daytime. Initially, the view focuses on newly installed light brown OSB (Oriented Strand Board) sheathing, characterized by its wood chip texture and rectangular panels. Various construction items are visible on and around this section, including a yellow power tool, an aluminum ladder leaning against the roof edge, a safety harness, yellow extension cords, and ropes. The surrounding ground shows green grass and a portion of a chain-link fence. As the drone moves, the view transitions to an older section of the roof, revealing weathered, dark brown wooden planks. These planks show signs of age, with some areas covered in black patches, possibly remnants of old roofing material or water damage, and some gaps between them.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
