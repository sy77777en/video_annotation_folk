  "merged_caption": "This is a fixed close-up shot of a pair of hands raised and entering the frame from the bottom right corner. The right hand, with its palm open, is positioned above the left hand, centrally in the frame, while the left hand is to the left, its fingers casting shadows across the right palm. A small amount of a red substance is visible on the tip of the right thumb, which is in the upper right of the frame. In the out-of-focus background, indistinct papers and a red-colored object in the bottom right are visible. The camera is positioned above the hands, looking down at them. From a high, eye-level angle, the camera focuses on a pair of hands in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The shot is mostly static, exhibiting only minor, smooth, unintentional movement. In a close-up shot, a person's hands are raised into the frame, with one hand held up to display a bloody thumb. The scene is illuminated by a warm, directional light that highlights the hands against an indistinct background. The person, who has a light skin tone, holds their right hand up with the palm open. The tip of the right thumb is covered in a small amount of a wet, red substance that appears to be blood. The left hand is positioned near the right, with the fingers of both hands loosely touching and casting shadows across the right palm. The background is out of focus, showing the faint outlines of papers and a red-colored object on a flat surface.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a pair of hands is held in the foreground, illuminated by a warm, directional light that creates soft shadows. The palm of one hand is visible, and the tip of its thumb is coated in a wet, red substance. The fingers of the other hand are partially interlaced with the first. The background is out of focus, showing the faint outlines of papers and a red-colored object on a flat surface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
