  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a small, cloaked humanoid character with an orange, pumpkin-like head stands in the center of the frame in the middle ground, in a grassy yard at night. The head features glowing, carved, oval-shaped eyes and a carved, smiling mouth. The character is clad in a long, grey, hooded cloak that obscures its body, revealing only thin, stick-like legs. To the right, a square garden plot containing small green sprouts is enclosed by a white picket fence and a border of round stones, occupying the middle ground. Fences are visible in the background on the left and top of the frame. UI elements are situated as overlays at the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right, including a gold coin icon with the number 160, an inventory bar, and two vertical glass tubes, one partially filled with a blue liquid. The scene is rendered in a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic with thick black outlines and illuminated by a warm, orange light. The camera, from a high-angle, overhead perspective, smoothly tracks the avatar with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. As the character walks from the middle ground toward the foreground, the camera primarily trucks to the right and moves downward, with some minor leftward trucking adjustments throughout the shot. The camera pulls back, revealing a circular stone well with a wooden roof and a bucket, situated in the center of a circular brick path, moving from the bottom edge to occupy the foreground of the scene. The character stops in front of the well, and a text prompt reading \"HOLD [F]\" appears over the inventory bar as the character gets near.",

    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video, a small, cloaked character with an orange, pumpkin-like head stands in a grassy yard at night. The scene, rendered in a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic with thick black outlines, is illuminated by a warm, orange light. The character walks from a tilled garden plot, which is enclosed by a white picket fence and contains rows of small green sprouts, towards the foreground. As they approach, the camera pulls back to reveal a stone well with a wooden roof and a bucket, situated in the center of a circular brick path. A heads-up display is present, showing a coin icon with the number 160 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and two vertical vials in the bottom-right, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid. A text prompt reading \"HOLD [F]\" appears over the well as the character gets near.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
