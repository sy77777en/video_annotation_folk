  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the subject's body occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground, with their legs positioned in the center. A partially constructed brick wall extends horizontally across both the foreground and middle ground, from the left to the right of the frame. A set of stairs is visible along the entire right side of the scene, while a bucket of mortar sits in the left middle ground. Initially, the subject's left hand is in the center foreground, and their right hand holds a brick in the bottom right foreground. The hands handle the brick together before placing it onto the wall in the center foreground. The video is filmed from a first-person, head-mounted perspective, creating an upside-down, high-angle view from approximately eye level. The camera movements, though erratic, purposefully track a brick as it is being placed on a wall, with a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp. From a first-person perspective, a person holds a red brick with both hands, rotating it 180 degrees. Using their left hand, they carefully position the brick onto a layer of wet mortar on the wall, pressing it down firmly to set it in place next to the previous brick. The scene is set at an outdoor construction site during the day. A person is in the process of laying a course of reddish-orange, rough-textured bricks onto a low wall using wet, grey mortar. The ground consists of uneven reddish-brown dirt and rubble, with a blue coiled cord and other construction debris visible in the background. A white string is positioned to the right of the person's legs, lying on the ground. To the right, a grey, rough-surfaced concrete structure forms a set of stairs.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks. He is wearing dark shorts with a pink and purple pattern, a light-colored shirt, and blue flip-flops. A black bracelet is visible on his right forearm. His hands are covered in grey mortar as he holds a rectangular, reddish-orange brick, preparing to place it on a partially constructed wall in front of him. The wall is also made of red bricks, with a fresh layer of wet mortar on the top course.",

    "Scene": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set at an outdoor construction site during the day.

The ground consists of uneven reddish-brown dirt and rubble, with a blue coiled cord and other construction debris visible in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
