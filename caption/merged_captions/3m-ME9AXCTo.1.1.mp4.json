  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot captures a man with light skin and voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair dancing with a woman who has light skin and long, straight blonde hair in the foreground, positioned in the center of the frame. The man wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bow tie and has a white flower pinned to his lapel, while the woman is dressed in a light-colored, off-shoulder garment and wears a corsage of pinkish flowers on her wrist. The shot is taken from a low angle, adding a unique perspective to the scene. Initially, the man is on the left with his back mostly to the camera, while the woman is on the right. In the foreground, star-shaped decorations hang from the top of the frame, while out-of-focus red and green lights and other decorations are visible in the background, creating a dimly lit, festive atmosphere. As the couple sways slowly together in a close dance, holding hands and keeping their arms around each other, the camera arcs counterclockwise around them, causing their relative positions to continuously change; they move to face each other in profile at the center before the man's back is again toward the camera. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, following their rotation. The focus is shallow, keeping the couple in the foreground sharp while the background is blurred. They look into each other's eyes and lean in until their faces are nearly touching, with their mouths moving slightly, suggesting they might be conversing while dancing. The dark space is decorated with glittery, star-shaped ornaments hanging from above, and the atmosphere is defined by soft, out-of-focus red and green lights that create a hazy glow and circular lens flares.",

    "Camera": "From a low, slightly unsteady angle between hip and eye level, the camera arcs counterclockwise around a couple dancing. The focus is shallow, keeping the couple in the foreground sharp while the background is blurred.",
    "Subject": "A man with light skin and voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair is dancing with a woman who has light skin and long, straight blonde hair. The man wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bow tie and has a white flower pinned to his lapel. The woman is dressed in a light-colored, off-shoulder garment and wears a corsage of pinkish flowers on her wrist.

    "Motion": "A man and a woman sway slowly together in a close dance. The camera arcs counterclockwise around the couple as they turn. They hold hands and keep their arms around each other, looking into each other's eyes and leaning in until their faces are nearly touching, with their mouths moving slightly, suggesting they might be conversing while dancing.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene is set in a dimly lit environment, likely a dance or party. The dark space is decorated with glittery, star-shaped ornaments hanging from above. The atmosphere is defined by soft, out-of-focus red and green lights that create a hazy glow and circular lens flares. A couple is seen slow dancing in the middle of the room, their movements gentle as they turn beneath the festive lights and decorations.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
