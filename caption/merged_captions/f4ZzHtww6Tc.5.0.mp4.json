  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, capturing the lower body of a man with extensive tattoos on both arms as he skateboards, wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt, dark pants, and black and white sneakers. The skateboard, with a dark top surface, is in the upper half of the frame, slightly to the right. The foreground features a dark concrete slope that fills the frame and extends into the midground, connecting with a grassy area in the upper part of the shot. As the skateboarder rides up the slope below the grassy area, the camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, smoothly tracks his movement in slow motion, tilting upward to reveal two silver SUVs in the background—one in the upper left and the other in the upper right of the frame. This movement repositions the skateboarder in a full shot, slightly right of center in the upper half of the frame, now showing his full figure, including a light-colored baseball cap worn forwards on his head. In the background, two black cars become visible in the upper right section, along with a building with a blue facade and a sign with the word \"Donations\" visible. Bright sunlight casts a prominent, dark shadow into the concrete channel. As the skateboarder reaches the top edge of the slope, he stops the skateboard and jumps off, landing at the bottom of the slope. The camera zooms in to emphasize the subject, concluding with a slight downward tilt as the skateboarder jumps down from the top of the slope, slightly right of center, moving from the upper to the lower half of the frame, leaving only his upper body visible. Behind him, black Jeeps and a white wall occupy the upper half of the frame.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a skateboarder. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly tracks the skateboarder's movement, tilting upward as the skateboarder ascends the ramp and zooming in to emphasize the subject. As the skateboarder jumps off the top of the ramp, the camera concludes with a slight downward tilt. The subject becomes larger in the frame as the camera follows them.",
    "Subject": "The video focuses on a man with extensive tattoos on both arms as he skateboards. He is wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt, dark pants, and black and white sneakers. Initially, the view is on his lower body and the skateboard, which has a dark top surface. The perspective then shifts to show his full figure, revealing a light-colored baseball cap worn forwards on his head. He balances on the edge of a concrete structure before jumping off, after which the focus moves to his upper body.",
    "Motion": "A skateboarder rides up a dark concrete slope below a grassy area. As he reaches the top edge, he stops the skateboard and jumps off, landing at the bottom of the slope.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene during the daytime, featuring a dark concrete drainage ditch with sloped sides. A grassy bank with green foliage lines the top edge of the ditch. In the background, a parking lot contains several vehicles, including a silver SUV and a black Jeep. Behind these vehicles, a building with a blue facade has a sign with the word \"Donations\" visible. Bright sunlight casts a prominent, dark shadow into the concrete channel.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
