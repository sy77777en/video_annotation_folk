  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a young, light-skinned boy with short, dark brown hair styled in a bowl cut with an undercut, wearing a white collared shirt under a dark green knitted vest. He is filmed at his level, consistently positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, his head is tilted back with eyes open as he holds a watermelon slice in both hands, ready to take a big bite. A light khaki-colored rectangular tray laden with several bright red, sliced pieces of watermelon with green rinds and black seeds occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. In the blurred background, a chair with a high back is visible to the left, while another similar chair is in the middle ground to the right, and a light green cabinet or piece of furniture is further to the right in the background. The room is illuminated by soft, natural-looking light, suggesting daytime, with light streaming in from a window out of view, casting soft shadows. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle with a fixed Dutch angle throughout, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the midground in focus. The camera moves forward quickly with very smooth motion. As the boy prepares to take a big bite, he momentarily closes his eyes. As he opens his mouth wide, his eyes remain open, revealing large, dark pupils, and he looks to the left with a surprised or shocked expression. His gaze shifts towards the right of the frame, while his overall position and the arrangement of other elements remain unchanged. The watermelon slices on the tray remain unchanged throughout the sequence.",

    "Subject": "The video features a young, light-skinned boy with short, dark brown hair styled in a bowl cut with an undercut. He is wearing a white collared shirt under a dark green knitted vest. Initially, the boy tilts his head back with his eyes open, holding the watermelon slice in both hands, ready to take a big bite. Just before biting, he briefly closes his eyes. Subsequently, his eyes are wide open, revealing large, dark pupils, and they glance off to the left, while his mouth is agape in a surprised or shocked expression, still holding the watermelon slice. In front of him, on a light-colored tray, are several other bright red watermelon slices with green rinds and black seeds.",
    "Motion": "The boy, standing in a well-lit room with a blurred background, cradles a slice of watermelon in both hands. He prepares to take a big bite, tilting his head back and closing his eyes momentarily. As he opens his mouth wide, his eyes remain open, and he looks to the left with a surprised expression. The watermelon slices on the tray remain unchanged throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, likely in a dining area or kitchen, with a light-colored table in the foreground. On the table, a light khaki-colored rectangular tray holds several bright red, sliced pieces of watermelon with green rinds and black seeds. In the blurred background, a chair with a high back is visible to the left, and another similar chair is to the right. A light green cabinet or piece of furniture can be seen behind and to the right of the similarly styled chair on the right. The room is illuminated by soft, natural-looking light, suggesting daytime, with light streaming in from a window out of view, casting soft shadows.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a medium shot of a boy, filmed at his level. The boy is consistently positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, his head is tilted back with eyes open as he holds a watermelon slice. A tray laden with watermelon slices occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. In the blurred background, a chair is visible to the left, while another chair is in the middle ground to the right, and a green cabinet is further to the right in the background. The primary dynamic within the static frame occurs as the boy opens his eyes wide, his gaze shifting towards the right of the frame, while his overall position and the arrangement of other elements remain unchanged."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
