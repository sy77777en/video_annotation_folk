  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot from a high angle, a light-colored passenger bus is parked horizontally among bare, dark trees in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center in a dark, foggy wooded area at night. The scene is starkly illuminated by several powerful, bright white lights positioned off-camera among the trees, their beams cutting through the mist and creating strong, distorted reflections on the wet ground or a body of water. Bright lights are visible in the background on the left and right. A red and dark-colored locomotive with a red stripe enters from the middle ground on the upper right and travels diagonally toward the center-left, where it collides with the stationary bus. Upon impact, the locomotive emits smoke and sparks as it continues to push the bus toward the left side of the frame. The camera smoothly pans left and zooms in, tracking the locomotive's movement while maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. This action makes the locomotive the central subject in the middle ground, pushing the first vehicle toward the left of the frame as trees in the left foreground become more prominent. The entire scene is shrouded in thick fog, and smoke or steam rises in the distance, surrounded by the dense, dark forest.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera smoothly pans left and zooms in, tracking a crashed train at night. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A long, light-colored passenger bus is parked on the road in a dark, wooded area at night. A red and dark-colored locomotive is depicted moving from the upper right corner of the frame to the lower left corner, colliding with the bus. The entire scene is shrouded in thick fog and illuminated by several powerful, bright white lights, which create a hazy atmosphere and cast stark reflections. Surrounding the crash are numerous bare, dark trees, visible as silhouettes against the intense backlighting.",
    "Motion": "A locomotive with a red stripe moves from the right side of the frame toward the left, where it collides with a stationary bus parked on the way. Upon impact, the locomotive emits smoke and sparks as it continues to push the bus toward the left side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "At night, within a dark and foggy wooded area, a large vehicle resembling a bus or train car is parked on the road. The scene is starkly illuminated by several powerful, bright lights positioned off-camera among the bare trees, their beams cutting through the mist and creating strong, distorted reflections on the wet ground or a body of water. Smoke or steam rises in the distance, surrounded by the dense, dark forest. The camera pans, revealing more of the surrounding environment.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot from a high angle, a light-colored vehicle is parked horizontally among the trees in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center. Bare trees occupy the foreground and middle ground, with bright lights visible in the background on the left and right. A locomotive then enters from the middle ground on the upper right and travels diagonally toward the center-left, colliding with the stationary vehicle. The camera pans left to follow the locomotive's movement, keeping the wide shot consistent. This action makes the locomotive the central subject in the middle ground, pushing the first vehicle toward the left of the frame as trees in the left foreground become more prominent."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
