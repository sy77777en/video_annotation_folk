  "merged_caption": "From a first-person bird's-eye view, the scene is framed looking down at a construction site during the daytime. The lower body of a person with brown skin occupies the bottom-center foreground, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt over a purple and pink patterned garment, and blue flip-flops. Their right arm extends from the bottom right toward the middle ground, where multiple thin white cords guide the placement of reddish-orange bricks being laid in rows with wet, grey mortar. In the middle ground, a dark green plastic basin containing more grey mortar and a trowel with an orange handle sits on a concrete surface. A low, partially constructed brick wall stretches horizontally across the middle ground, initially appearing at the top before moving to the right as the camera shifts. The top-right background shows a lower level of unpaved ground with dirt, large rocks, and some green vegetation. The video is captured from a first-person, bird's-eye view, with the camera positioned at eye level and pointing directly down at the ground. The camera rolls counterclockwise quickly as the person takes a step forward with their left foot, focusing on a row of bricks, exhibiting some slight unsteadiness and shaking. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the person's feet to the ground below in sharp detail.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a first-person, bird's-eye view, with the camera positioned at eye level and pointing directly down at the ground. The camera rolls counterclockwise quickly as the person turns, exhibiting some slight unsteadiness and shaking. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the person's feet to the ground below in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with brown skin is standing on a construction site. That person is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt over a purple and pink patterned garment wrapped around that person's lower body. On that person's right wrist, there is a black bracelet, and on that person's feet are blue flip-flops. Multiple thin white cords are placed on the ground in front of that person's right hand, guiding the placement of reddish-orange bricks that are being laid in rows with wet, grey mortar. Directly in front of that person, a dark green plastic basin contains more grey mortar, with a trowel that has an orange handle sticking out of the mixture.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person takes a step forward with their left foot, focusing on a row of bricks.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor construction scene during the daytime. From a concrete slab, the view looks down upon a low, partially constructed wall made of rectangular orange bricks held by wet, dark gray mortar. A green plastic basin containing more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle rests on the concrete. Below this elevated area, the ground is unpaved, showing dirt, large rocks, and some green vegetation. The person's lower body is dressed in a patterned garment, and they are wearing a light-colored shirt on their upper body.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person bird's-eye view, the scene is framed looking down at a construction site. The lower body of a person occupies the bottom-center foreground, with their right arm extending from the bottom right toward the middle ground. In the middle ground, a green basin containing mortar and a trowel sits on a concrete surface. A low, partially constructed brick wall stretches horizontally across the middle ground, initially appearing at the top before moving to the right as the camera shifts. Thin white guide strings are visible in the right middle ground. The top-right background shows a lower level of unpaved ground with dirt, rocks, and some vegetation."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
