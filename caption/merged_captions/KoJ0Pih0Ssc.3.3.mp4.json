  "merged_caption": "This medium shot is captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at two glowing red, featureless humanoid figures positioned in the central left and central right of the frame. The figure on the left holds a long, thin red object vertically with both hands, resembling someone holding a rifle, while the figure on the right holds a shorter, red, rod-like object in a manner resembling someone aiming a rifle, pointing it upwards and to the right. In the background, a large, grey building with lit windows occupies the right side of the frame, set against a dark sky, creating an urban night scene. The overall scene has a monochromatic color scheme, with the figures providing a stark red contrast. The camera, from a low, hip-level angle, focuses on the two red, stylized figures in the foreground, using a shallow depth of field that blurs the building behind them. The camera moves slowly and smoothly from left to right, with no movement from the subjects, maintaining the spatial composition largely unchanged throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "Two featureless, humanoid figures, rendered in a solid, glowing red, are shown from a low angle. The figure on the left holds a long, thin red object vertically with both hands, looking upwards, resembling someone holding a rifle. The figure on the right holds a shorter, red, rod-like object in a manner resembling someone aiming a rifle, pointing it upwards and to the right. Both figures are stylized and lack any discernible clothing, hair, or facial features.",
    "Motion": "This is a shot where the camera slightly moves to the right, with no movement from the subjects.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, the scene is set at night in an urban environment, with a large, grey building featuring lit windows against a dark sky. In the foreground, two glowing red, featureless humanoid figures are depicted. One figure holds a long, thin red rod horizontally, resembling the way one would hold a rifle. To the right, the second figure holds a shorter red rod horizontally, as if aiming it. The overall scene has a monochromatic color scheme, with the figures providing a stark red contrast.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot is captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at two red, humanoid figures positioned in the central left and central right of the frame. In the background, a large, grey building occupies the right side of the frame, set against a dark sky. While the spatial composition remains largely unchanged, there is minor camera movement to the right throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
