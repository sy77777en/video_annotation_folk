  "merged_caption": "The video shows a close-up shot of a pair of small hands holding a framed photograph. Initially, the hands are centered in the frame, holding the photograph in the foreground. The photograph itself is positioned centrally within the frame, depicting two individuals in dark tops holding a red object, with three additional people in the background, set against a vibrant background. The hands and photograph occupy the middle ground, while the open trunk and its contents form the background. Various items, such as folded clothes and personal belongings, are arranged around the edges of the trunk, with a green cloth on the right side and a red pouch near the center. As the video progresses, the hands move the photograph downward and place it into the trunk, shifting the photograph from the foreground to the middle ground. The trunk's interior, lined with checkered fabric, remains consistently in the background throughout the sequence. The video is a stop-motion animation with the camera positioned at eye level, using a bird's-eye view angle to look directly down at the scene. It employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the hands holding a framed photo in the foreground, then shifting focus to the midground items in the drawer. The camera remains static throughout, with no movement or shaking. The scene is presented as a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors. The open trunk is filled with various items, including neatly folded clothes and a few personal belongings. The lighting is soft, suggesting an indoor setting with ambient light, and the overall color palette is warm and muted, with earthy tones dominating the scene.",

    "Spatial": "The video shows a close-up shot of a pair of small hands holding a framed photograph. Initially, the hands are centered in the frame, holding the photograph in the foreground. The photograph itself is positioned centrally within the frame, depicting a group of five individuals. The hands and photograph occupy the middle ground, while the open trunk and its contents form the background. Various items, such as folded clothes and personal belongings, are arranged around the edges of the trunk, with a green cloth on the right side and a red pouch near the center. As the video progresses, the hands move the photograph downward and place it into the trunk, shifting the photograph from the foreground to the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
