  "merged_caption": "This is a time-lapse video captured from a static, ground-level, high-angle perspective of a greenhouse interior. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear. In the foreground and middle ground, several black drip irrigation hoses are arranged in parallel lines running horizontally across the light-brown tilled soil. A few wooden planks are positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The background is dominated by a row of large, leafy green plants, possibly a type of squash or pumpkin, that fill the top half of the frame, with some plants propped up by thin wooden stakes. The arched structure of the greenhouse is visible at the very top. In the latter half of the video, a white, cube-shaped greenhouse plastic structure becomes visible above the plant area on the right side. While the camera remains stationary, dynamic changes, such as plant growth, occur within the scene, emphasizing the organized cultivation within the greenhouse.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video captured from a static, ground-level, high-angle perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse scene, from the soil and irrigation lines in the foreground to the large plants in the background, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This is a wide scenery shot of the interior of a greenhouse. In the foreground and middle ground, several black irrigation hoses are laid out in parallel rows across the dark, tilled soil. Wooden planks are regularly placed along the path between the hoses. Further back, a row of large, vibrant green plants with massive, broad leaves thrives, supported by thin wooden stakes. The focus is on the overall environment and agricultural setup, emphasizing the organized cultivation within the greenhouse.",
    "Motion": "This is a static shot from inside a greenhouse or polytunnel. Rows of large, leafy green plants, possibly a type of squash or pumpkin, are growing in tilled soil. Black drip irrigation lines run parallel to the plant rows, and wooden stakes support the large plants.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a greenhouse with a visible arched frame and translucent covering. In the foreground and middle ground, the tilled, light-brown soil is arranged with several parallel black drip irrigation hoses running horizontally across the frame. Flat wooden boards are regularly arranged in the path between the hoses. In the background, a row of large, vibrant green plants with very broad leaves thrives, with some plants propped up by wooden stakes.",
    "Spatial": "This is a static wide shot of a greenhouse interior, captured from a high angle. In the foreground and middle ground, several black drip irrigation hoses are arranged in parallel lines running horizontally across the light-brown tilled soil.

The background is dominated by a row of large, leafy green plants that fill the top half of the frame, with the arched structure of the greenhouse visible at the very top.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
