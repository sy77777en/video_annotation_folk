  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full-body shot of Tom, a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. He is standing on a large bed with neatly arranged white bedding and a brown headboard, set against a softly lit bedroom with beige and brown tones. Tom is focused on Jerry, a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly, who is trapped under an upside-down transparent goblet on the pillow near a black remote control in the center of the frame. The background features light green curtains. Tom leans forward, emphasizing his focus on Jerry, and uses both hands to wrap Jerry in a white cloth. The camera, positioned at eye level with a shallow depth of field, begins with a level angle and pans slightly to the right, pausing before tilting downward to follow Tom’s movement. As Tom lifts the bundled package in his left hand, the camera remains at the subject's level. In the final moment, Tom jumps off the bed, moving from the foreground to the bottom of the frame, and the shot size changes to a close-up of Tom's hands, highlighting his exit from the scene. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, maintaining focus on Tom throughout. The interaction between the animated characters causes visible movement and creasing in the fabric of the bedding, with the focus on the bed and its immediate surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a level angle, focusing on Tom the cat in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera then pans slightly to the right, pauses, and tilts downward to follow Tom’s movement as he jumps off the bed. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and the focus remains on Tom in the foreground throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features two animated characters: a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, and a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly. The cat, named Tom, is standing on a bed and is focused on the mouse, named Jerry, who is trapped inside an upside-down transparent goblet on the pillow beside a black remote control. Tom eagerly wraps Jerry in a white cloth with both hands. Holding the bundled package in his left hand, Tom jumps off the bed, highlighting the dynamic between the two characters.",
    "Motion": "Tom stands on the bed and reaches toward Jerry, who is trapped under an upside-down goblet on the pillow next to a remote control. Tom uses both hands to wrap Jerry in a white cloth, lifts the bundled package in his left hand, and then jumps off the bed while holding the package.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom with beige and brown tones. A large bed with neatly arranged, white bedding and a brown headboard is positioned against the wall, with thick, light green curtains hanging in the background. A black remote control rests on the bed near the center. The scene features animated characters interacting with the bedding, causing visible movement and creasing in the fabric. The focus is on the bed and its immediate surroundings, with no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full-body shot of Tom, the cat, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, reaching towards Jerry, the mouse, who is trapped under a goblet on the bed in the center. The bed and pillow occupy the middle ground, with the remote control near the center of the frame. The background features light green curtains. Tom's initial movement involves leaning forward, emphasizing his focus on Jerry. As Tom wraps Jerry in a cloth, the camera remains at the subject's level. In the final moment, as Tom jumps off the bed and moves from the foreground to the bottom of the frame, the shot size changes to a close-up of Tom's hands, highlighting his exit from the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
