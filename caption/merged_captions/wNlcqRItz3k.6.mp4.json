  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed from a slightly elevated angle, captures two men in the foreground on a red running track with distinct white lane lines. An athlete with short dark hair and tan skin, wearing a red tracksuit jacket with a white inner collar and a silver medal on a red ribbon around his neck, stands in the center. He holds a small, red and yellow lion-like stuffed animal mascot with a heart on its chest in his left hand. A man in a light blue tracksuit jacket over a shirt with a red collar, with the word \"MYANMAR\" printed in white across the back, is positioned to his right. The man in blue hands the stuffed animal to the man in red, who accepts it, and they then shake hands in the bottom center right of the frame. Following the handshake, the man in the blue jacket moves down and towards the bottom right, while the athlete remains stationary in the center. The track's white lines extend from the middle ground to the background, and a portion of a red and white striped flag is visible in the top right corner throughout the shot. From a high angle, the camera captures the man receiving the award, with the shot mostly steady and slight, smooth handheld shaking. A deep focus is used, keeping both the athlete and the presenter sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
