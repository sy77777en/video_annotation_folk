  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with long brown hair and a focused expression is positioned in the foreground, occupying the center-right of the frame and holding the camera at her own level. She is wearing a wide-brimmed maroon fedora, a red shirt, and a blue denim jacket. Behind her in the middle ground, a man with long brown hair, a beard, and a backward-facing tan baseball cap with a camera mounted on it is located to the left of the center. He is dressed in a blue and green plaid shirt and light brown pants, with sunglasses hanging from his collar, and is carrying a young, blonde-haired girl who is wearing a pink and purple tie-dye shirt and dark pants. The girl is eating a small, light-colored object on a stick. Tall grass fills the foreground and middle ground around the subjects. In the background, hills and trees extend across the upper portion of the frame under a cloudy sky. The entire group moves forward through the grass, with the woman leading and the man and child following, maintaining their consistent spatial arrangement throughout the shot. The camera, held by the woman in the foreground, moves backward to track her, the man, and the child as they move through the field of tall grass. This slow-motion video is filmed from a smooth, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, using a deep focus to keep the family and the background scenery sharp. The scene is set outdoors, capturing the group walking through a field of tall, dense green grass, with tree-covered hills visible in the background.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a group walking through a field of tall, dense green grass. The scene is set outdoors under a cloudy sky, with tree-covered hills visible in the background. The person holding the camera is a woman with long brown hair, wearing a red fedora-style hat and a blue denim jacket over a red shirt. Following behind her is a man with long hair and a beard, dressed in a blue and green plaid shirt and a tan baseball cap worn backward. He is carrying a small, blonde-haired child who is wearing a pink and purple tie-dye shirt. The group moves forward through the high grass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
