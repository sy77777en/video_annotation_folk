  "merged_caption": "The video showcases an expansive cosmic scene with no distinct major subjects. The swirling nebulae and stars occupy the entire frame, creating a dynamic and fluid composition. The nebulae, in shades of blue, green, and purple, are distributed across the frame, with some clusters more prominent in the top left and right areas. These nebulae appear in the background, providing a sense of depth. The stars are scattered throughout, with some brighter ones located near the center and others dispersed towards the edges. Numerous shining stars appear to be approaching the camera and gradually fade from the screen, enhancing the sense of movement and depth. The video begins with a view of a dark, star-filled space, with various shades of blue, green, and purple hues dominating the scene. The stars and nebulae appear to shift and change, creating a sense of motion and depth as they move closer to the camera. The colors and patterns continue to evolve, with some areas becoming brighter and more defined while others fade or blend into the background. The overall scene remains consistent with a cosmic theme, featuring a mix of bright stars and dark, cloudy regions. The movement of the stars and nebulae enhances the sense of exploration and discovery, drawing the viewer deeper into the space. The camera is stationary, capturing this cosmic scene, with its height, angle, and focus not determined due to a lack of background information. The overall composition suggests a celestial environment, possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy. The visual elements are fluid and ethereal, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos. The overall atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the nebulae's gaseous formations appearing soft and cloud-like against the dark, infinite void.",

    "Camera": "The video features a stationary camera capturing a cosmic scene. The camera's height, angle, and focus are not determined due to a lack of background information.",
    "Subject": "The video depicts a vast, abstract cosmic scene filled with swirling clouds of gas and dust in various shades of blue, green, and purple. Numerous small, bright stars are scattered throughout, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The colors blend seamlessly, giving the impression of a dynamic and expansive universe. The overall composition suggests a celestial environment, possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy. The visual elements are fluid and ethereal, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an expansive view of outer space, featuring a vast, star-filled cosmos. The setting is outdoors in the infinite expanse of the universe, with no specific location on Earth. The time of day is irrelevant in this context, as the scene is set in the timeless void of space. Notable visual elements include swirling nebulae with hues of blue, green, and purple, creating a textured and ethereal backdrop. Countless stars are scattered throughout, varying in brightness and size, and flicker intermittently, adding depth and dynamism to the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the nebulae's gaseous formations appearing soft and cloud-like against the dark, infinite void.",
    "Spatial": "The video showcases an expansive cosmic scene with no distinct major subjects. The swirling nebulae and stars occupy the entire frame, creating a dynamic and fluid composition.

Numerous shining stars appear to be approaching the camera and gradually fade from the screen, enhancing the sense of movement and depth. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the ethereal and complex nature of the cosmos, with the nebulae and stars maintaining their positions relative to each other throughout the sequence. The camera's height is not applicable in this context, as the scene is set in the boundless expanse of space."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
