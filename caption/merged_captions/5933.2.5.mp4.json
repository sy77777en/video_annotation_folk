  "merged_caption": "This extreme close-up shot focuses on a pair of hands in the foreground. The right hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, holds a pen, while the left hand is visible at the bottom right and upper portion, holding a small spiral-bound notepad that occupies the center-right foreground. The pen is actively drawing on the notepad in the center-right foreground, its tip moving across the paper to create a detailed sketch of a lighthouse, including its base, structure, and surrounding landscape. The background is blurred and indistinct, suggesting a natural environment with earthy tones. The hands and notepad remain relatively static in their position, while the pen moves to add more details to the lower part of the sketch, including lines that suggest the base and additional structural elements. The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at the person sketching. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made. The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic feel to the scene. The light-skinned hands emphasize the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch, with the focus remaining on the notepad and the sketching process. The scene maintains a neutral, observational perspective, emphasizing the act of drawing in a serene outdoor setting during daylight.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at a person sketching in a notebook. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made. The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic feel to the scene.",
    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a lighthouse on the notepad. The sketch includes the lighthouse structure with surrounding lines indicating the landscape or additional features. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.",
    "Motion": "A person is holding a small notepad with a sketch of a lighthouse on it, using a pen to add details to the drawing. The sketch includes various elements of the lighthouse, such as its base, structure, and surrounding landscape. The person's hand moves the pen to add more details to the lower part of the sketch, including lines that suggest the base and additional structural elements. The background is blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the hands, the notepad, and the drawing process.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting during daylight, featuring a close-up view of a hand sketching on a small notepad. The notepad is held by another hand, and the sketch depicts a simple structure, possibly a building or tower, drawn with a dark pen. The background is blurred, suggesting a natural environment, possibly with earthy tones. The focus remains on the notepad and the sketching process, highlighting the texture of the paper and the movement of the pen. The scene maintains a neutral, observational perspective, emphasizing the act of drawing in a serene outdoor setting.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme close-up shot focuses on a pair of hands in the foreground. The right hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, holds a pen. The left hand is visible at the bottom right and upper portion, holding a small notepad that occupies the center-right foreground. The pen is actively drawing on the notepad in the center-right foreground, its tip moving across the paper to create a sketch. The background is blurred and indistinct.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
