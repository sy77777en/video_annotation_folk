  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up of a middle-aged man with dark, slightly disheveled hair and a fair complexion, situated in the foreground, primarily on the right side of the frame. He is wearing a dark blue, collared, button-up shirt over a white undershirt, with a patch on his left chest displaying the letters \"ASA\" above the word \"WEIR.\" His eyes are wide, and his mouth is slightly agape, giving him a surprised or alarmed expression. He is seated, with his left side leaning against the right wall of a futuristic corridor characterized by green-hued metallic panels, which extends from the foreground to the background. The corridor's walls are visible on the left, right, and top of the frame, extending into the distance, creating a sense of depth and confinement. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit, futuristic corridor with a green hue dominating the environment, and the walls are lined with reflective, metallic panels that give the space a high-tech appearance. The lighting is low, casting subtle reflections and shadows across the surfaces, enhancing the sterile and mechanical atmosphere. The overall ambiance is one of tension and isolation, with the green lighting contributing to an otherworldly, technological vibe. The camera is at eye level and a level angle, using a shallow depth of field focused on the man in the foreground. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly moves forward while simultaneously zooming out, creating a dolly zoom effect, with the subject's size remaining approximately the same, while revealing marginally more of the surrounding corridor. The man remains stationary, looking directly forward with a surprised expression, as the camera slowly pulls back, creating a dolly zoom effect where the green, circuit-board-like background appears to recede.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
