  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot framing a group of young men wearing dark clothes gathered in a paved outdoor lot during a sunny day. In the central middle ground, two men are visible, including one with dark, curly hair wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, black pants, and red and white sneakers. To his left stands another young man in a black hoodie and black pants. Two more men stand near a dark-colored sedan with its driver's side door open, including a man in a black hoodie and another wearing a white beanie and a black jacket. In the left foreground, two men are seen from the back, both wearing black hoodies. In the middle ground, a man stands apart from the group, wearing a black hoodie with the hood up and white sneakers. The background features other parked vehicles, a dark green fence, and multi-story brick buildings, with a pile of cardboard boxes resting on the pavement near the edge of the lot. The camera, starting at a level, hip-height angle, executes a very smooth vertical arc, craning upward to an overhead, bird's-eye view, capturing the long, dark shadows stretching across the cracked gray ground. It then descends to an upside-down, high-angle shot at their eye level, initially positioned at the subject's level before shifting to a position above them on the cracked pavement below. A speed ramp effect changes the playback speed from a regular rate to a faster rate, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the movement.",

    "Camera": "This video features a speed ramp effect, where the playback speed changes from a regular rate to a faster rate. The camera begins at a level, hip-height angle on a group of people. It then executes a very smooth vertical arc, craning upward to an overhead, bird's-eye view before descending to an upside-down, high-angle shot at their eye level. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "A group of young men wearing dark clothes are gathered in a paved area next to a dark-colored sedan with its driver's side door open. The man in the center of the group has dark, curly hair and is wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, black pants, and red and white sneakers. To his left stands another young man in a black hoodie and black pants. In the foreground, two men are seen from the back, both wearing black hoodies. To the far left, another man in a black hoodie stands near the car, where another man wearing a white beanie and a black jacket is also visible. In the middle ground, a man stands apart from the group, wearing a black hoodie with the hood up and white sneakers.",
    "Motion": "The camera starts at a level angle, smoothly moving upward in a vertical arc around a group of men standing in a paved lot. It ascends to an overhead, bird's-eye view before descending back to their level, capturing an inverted high angle.",
    "Scene": "In a paved outdoor lot during a sunny day, long, dark shadows stretch across the cracked gray ground. A group of individuals in dark clothing stands near a black car with an open door. In the background, other parked vehicles, a dark green fence, and multi-story brick buildings are visible. A pile of cardboard boxes rests on the pavement near the edge of the lot. The camera executes a very smooth vertical arc, craning upward to an overhead, bird's-eye view before descending to an upside-down, high-angle shot at their eye level.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot framing a group of young men. In the central middle ground, two men are visible, while two more stand near a dark car with an open door in the middle ground. Another two men are positioned in the left foreground with their backs to the camera. The background features other cars and buildings. The camera then performs a smooth vertical arc, craning upward to transition into an overhead, bird's-eye view. It then descends to an upside-down, high-angle shot at eye level, initially positioned at the subject's level before shifting to a position above them on the cracked pavement below."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
