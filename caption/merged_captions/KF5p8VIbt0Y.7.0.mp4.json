  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, showing the entire industrial complex from a high-angle, aerial level. The long, rectangular buildings and tall structures with round tops are arranged in a grid pattern, occupying most of the frame. Roads and rail lines are visible throughout the scene, stretching across the frame. The rooftops of the buildings are made of corrugated metal and glass. A plane initially at the center moves upward toward the top center, remaining in the middle ground. The camera tilts upward to track the plane and then becomes static midway through the video. Shortly after, an explosion occurs near the bottom center of the frame, sending a dense cloud of dark smoke and debris upward and outward, quickly covering the lower and central portions of the complex. The smoke rapidly spreads, obscuring several of the buildings and tall structures as they disappear from view behind the thick cloud. The camera maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire cityscape sharp. The scene is rendered in black and white, and the video does not contain any overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks. As the smoke expands, it gradually obscures the buildings and tall structures from view.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a slightly unsteady, high-angle aerial shot from a fixed point above the city. The camera tilts upward to track a plane and then becomes static midway through the video to capture an explosion in the industrial area below, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire cityscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a large industrial complex with multiple long, rectangular buildings and several tall structures lined up in a row, each topped with a bright, round feature. The scene is viewed from above, providing a clear view of the geometric layout and the dense arrangement of the buildings. A plane flies across the frame from the center to the top, followed by an explosion. As the video progresses, a massive cloud of dark smoke and debris rapidly engulfs part of the complex, obscuring several of the buildings and the tall structures from view as they disappear behind the thick smoke.",
    "Motion": "A plane flies upward from the center across the industrial complex. Before the plane flies out of the frame, an explosion occurs within the complex, sending a large cloud of dark smoke and debris upward and outward. The smoke quickly spreads, covering and obscuring several of the buildings and tall structures as they disappear from view behind the thick cloud.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive industrial area with large rectangular factory buildings, warehouses, and a network of straight roads and rail lines. The setting is outdoors during the day, with the scene rendered in black and white. The rooftops of the buildings are made of corrugated metal and glass, and the area is densely packed with structures arranged in a grid-like pattern. In the center, a row of tall, thin towers or chimneys with bright, round tops lines a main thoroughfare. A plane flies across the frame from the center to the top. During the video, a large explosion occurs near the bottom of the complex, sending thick, dark smoke and debris billowing upward and outward, partially obscuring the surrounding buildings. The video does not contain any overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, showing the entire industrial complex from a high angle, aerial level.

As the smoke expands, it gradually obscures the buildings and tall structures from view. The camera slightly tilts upward and then keeps still as some buildings disappear behind the smoke."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
