  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a single, clear, colorless drinking glass centered in the middle ground, standing upright on a dark, reflective surface. The glass has a tumbler-like shape, slightly tapered so that it is wider at the rim than at its thick, rounded base. Initially, the lower portion of the glass is obscured by the surface it rests on. The scene is framed by two blurry, dark structures on the left and right sides of the foreground, with a solid, deep black background. The lighting is minimal and focused, highlighting the contours of the empty glass. A small, white text overlay displays a number in brackets, starting as \"[3]\" and changing to \"[4]\" partway through the video. As the shot progresses, the foreground surface moves down and out of view, revealing the entire glass and its clear reflection on the shiny surface below. The glass and its reflection remain stationary in the center of the frame. The clear glass appears to move forward along a black track, similar to an object on a conveyor belt, while the camera maintains a consistent distance from the glass, creating the illusion that the glass remains stationary within the frame. Apart from a minor downward shift at the start, the camera movement is predictable, staying low and close behind the glass throughout the video. This is a smooth dolly shot that moves forward, tracking the clear glass from behind. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the glass in focus while the dark, indistinct surroundings are blurred. The camera stays at the subject's level, and a small text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, monochromatic setting, a single, transparent glass with a slightly tapered shape is centered on a highly reflective surface, creating a clear mirror image directly beneath it, though the lower part of the glass is initially obstructed. The background is a solid, deep black, framed by two out-of-focus light-colored walls on either side. The lighting is minimal and focused, highlighting the contours of the empty glass. A small, white text overlay displays a number in brackets, starting as \"[3]\" and changing to \"[4]\" partway through the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
