  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot, featuring a shirtless man with dark skin, short dark hair, and a short dark beard and mustache, consistently positioned in the foreground center of the frame. He wears black shorts and a thin gold chain necklace. The scene is set in a dimly lit, spacious indoor area with dark, possibly metallic, paneled walls in the background, creating a stark and minimalist atmosphere. The lighting is focused, creating a spotlight effect on the central area while the surroundings remain in shadow. Initially, the man is bent over with his body slightly turned towards the left side of the frame, his hands down in front of him with his thumbs and index fingers touching to form a diamond shape, while the remaining fingers are held together. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead, and uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. As the video progresses, the man gradually straightens his posture, lifting his head and looking directly at the camera. The shot transitions to a medium shot as he brings his hands together in front of his lower abdomen, maintaining the diamond shape with his thumbs and index fingers. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, remaining at the subject's level throughout this sequence. The background remains dark, with a large, closed door or wall behind him, emphasizing the focused lighting on the man.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
