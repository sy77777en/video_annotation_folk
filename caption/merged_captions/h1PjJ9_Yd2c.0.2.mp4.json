  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a young woman with long, dark brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a grey short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and black sneakers, positioned in the top right of the frame as she walks down a set of outdoor concrete stairs. She carries a black bag slung over her right shoulder. The stairs, located on the right in the middle ground, have a white metal railing on one side and lead down to a sloping grassy area. The background features a tiered seating structure with a primarily gray facade and a small section of green, topped by a large, covered roof supported by metal beams. A tree is situated in the left background, and a building with large windows is visible in the far-left background. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens and greys. As the woman descends the stairs steadily, maintaining a consistent pace, the camera, positioned at eye level, moves forward to approach her, with a slight pan to the left. The movement is unsteady and shaky, suggesting it is handheld. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, the woman continues walking forward onto the grassy area, and the shot transitions to a full shot, with her remaining on the right side of the frame. The grassy area slopes, occupying both the bottom foreground and middle ground. The camera maintains a level angle, utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the scene at what appears to be a sports facility, possibly a tennis club or stadium, under an overcast sky. The tiered seating structure spans the background from the center to the right, while the tree and building with windows remain visible in the background.",

The stairs have a white metal railing on one side and lead down to a sloping grassy area. In the background, there is a tiered seating structure with a primarily gray facade and a small section of green, topped by a large, covered roof supported by metal beams.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
