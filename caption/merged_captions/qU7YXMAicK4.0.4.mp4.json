  "merged_caption": "This wide, high-angle shot initially frames a large-leafed green plant in the center-left middle ground of a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic sheeting. Several black irrigation pipes run from the foreground toward the background, with wooden planks laid across them in the middle ground. In the top-left background, black pots containing pink and white flowering plants are visible. The camera remains static, capturing a time-lapse of the plant growing as its leaves visibly expand and unfurl, with new shoots emerging from its base. A thin wooden stake is placed in the soil for support, followed by the addition and subsequent removal of a second stake. In the second half of the video, the black pots disappear, and the same spot is later occupied by green plants in white pots situated on a wooden structure in the top-left background. Shadows from outside shift across the semi-transparent white plastic sheeting of the walls. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse scene, from the foreground soil to the background plants, sharp and clear.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a fixed, stable, high-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse scene, from the foreground soil to the background plants, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "Inside a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic sheeting, a single, large-leafed green plant, possibly a squash or pumpkin, grows in the center of the dark, tilled soil. A thin wooden stake is placed next to the plant for support, and over time, the number and position of the stakes change, with one or two stakes appearing at different times. Several long, black, flexible drip irrigation pipes run in parallel lines along the ground. Laid perpendicularly across these pipes are several light-colored wooden planks. In the background on the left, several black pots contain flowering plants with pink and white blossoms, but in the latter part of the video, these pots are no longer visible, and the area is instead occupied by green plants in white pots.",
    "Motion": "The camera remains static, capturing a time-lapse of a large-leafed plant growing in the center-left of the frame within a greenhouse. The plant's leaves visibly expand and unfurl as new shoots emerge from its base. A wooden stake is placed in the soil for support, followed by the addition and subsequent removal of a second stake. In the background, potted flowers are replaced by a different set of plants, and shadows from outside shift across the semi-transparent white plastic sheeting of the walls.",
    "Scene": "Inside a long, arched greenhouse with a translucent plastic covering, the ground is composed of tilled soil with black irrigation hoses running parallel across it. A single, large-leafed green plant grows prominently, supported by a thin stake. Wooden planks are laid across the soil at intervals. Initially, black pots contain pink and white flowering plants, but later in the video, these are replaced by green plants in white pots. The shadows of trees from outside are cast upon the plastic walls.",
    "Spatial": "This wide, high-angle shot initially frames a large-leafed green plant in the center-left middle ground of a greenhouse. Several black irrigation pipes run from the foreground toward the background, with wooden planks laid across them in the middle ground. In the top-left background, black pots containing flowering plants are visible. A thin wooden stake is then added to support the central plant. In the second half of the video, the black pots disappear, and the same spot is later occupied by green plants in white pots situated on a wooden structure in the top-left background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
