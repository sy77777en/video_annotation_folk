  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of a black, toy rocket with a bright red interior, centrally positioned in the foreground throughout the scene. Inside the rocket stands a black, retro-style toy robot with red feet, a silver ribbed head, and a square torso. Initially, the partial face of a young man with fair skin and dark, shaggy hair, wearing a dark jacket, occupies the right foreground. In the middle ground, several people are visible to the right, standing in a grassy field backed by bare trees under an overcast sky. As the central toy rocket, carrying the robot, ascends and moves forward, the camera, fixed at the subject's level, pans with it, maintaining the rocket's fixed position in the center of the frame. This movement provides a panoramic view of the grassy field and causes the background to shift, revealing a paved road, a parked red car on the left, and a dark SUV on the right. The people in the middle ground, including a man in a blue jacket, a woman in a dark coat, and another person near a camera tripod, also move across the frame from right to left as the perspective changes. The camera captures a dynamic shot with a slightly unsteady movement and mild barrel distortion, resembling a dash camera point of view. It then moves backward and ascends, transitioning to a high-angle, aerial perspective while maintaining deep focus on both the foreground robot and the background environment. The toy rocket remains consistently sized and centered, while the surrounding environment is revealed through the camera's movement. There is an obstruction partially covering the upper right corner of the frame, possibly due to something blocking the camera lens.",

    "Camera": "This video captures a dynamic shot with a slightly unsteady camera that exhibits mild barrel distortion. The scene resembling a dash camera point of view, as it focuses consistently on a toy robot inside a model rocket. The camera then moves backward and ascends, transitioning to a high-angle, aerial perspective while maintaining deep focus on both the foreground robot and the background environment.",
    "Subject": "The central subject is a black, toy rocket with a bright red interior, inside of which stands a black, retro-style toy robot with red feet, a silver ribbed head, and a square torso. To the right, the partial face of a young man with fair skin and dark, shaggy hair, wearing a dark jacket, is visible in the foreground. In the background, several other people are present in a grassy field: a man in a blue jacket, a woman in a dark coat, and another person standing near a camera tripod. A red car and a dark SUV are also visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "The toy rocket, carrying a robot, ascends and moves forward, providing a panoramic view of a grassy field. In the background, several people stand and watch, while a red car and a black SUV are parked beside the road.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, fixed to a central object, shows a black, vintage-style toy robot with red feet standing inside an open-fronted, rocket-shaped container. The container is black on the outside with a bright red interior. The scene is set outdoors in a grassy, rural landscape under an overcast sky, with bare trees in the background. As the object is lifted and moves, the perspective pans across the scenery, revealing a narrow paved road with a parked red car, a black SUV, and a few people observing from a distance in the field. There is an obstruction partially covering the upper right corner of the frame, possibly due to something blocking the camera lens.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
