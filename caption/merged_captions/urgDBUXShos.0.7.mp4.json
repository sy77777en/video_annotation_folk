  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot in a dimly lit, spacious area, possibly a ballroom or large hall during an evening event. A man with white face paint, dark circles around his eyes, and greasy, medium-length dark hair with lighter streaks, wearing a dark purple suit jacket, is positioned in the left foreground, shown in profile facing right. A woman with long hair pinned up, revealing part of her neck, and wearing a dark green top, is in the right foreground, in profile facing left. The man's dark-gloved hand is in the center foreground, pressing firmly against the woman's left cheek and neck, while a small, metallic, blade-like object is slightly to the right, held near her cheek and mouth. The woman trembles slightly, her gaze shifting downward at first, then slowly rising to meet the man's intense stare. Both are shown in profile, facing each other. In the left background, a prominent, textured, light-colored pillar or wall section is visible, with indistinct figures of people suggesting a gathering. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle with a shallow depth of field, keeping the two people in the foreground in focus. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The overall lighting is subdued, creating a dark ambiance.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the two people in the foreground in focus. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "In the video, a man with white face paint, dark circles around his eyes, and red paint extending from his mouth in a smile, is shown in profile facing right. He has greasy, medium-length dark hair with some lighter streaks and is wearing a dark purple suit jacket. He is very close to a woman who is in profile facing left. The woman has long hair pinned up, revealing part of her neck, and is wearing a dark green top. The man's dark-gloved fingers press against her cheek while he holds a small, metallic, blade-like object near her cheek and mouth.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit, elegant setting with a blurred background, a man with white face paint and dark circles around his eyes, wearing a dark purple suit jacket, grips a woman's face tightly with his gloved hand, his fingers pressing firmly against her cheek and neck. In the same hand, he holds a small blade, hovering near her face and lips. The woman, with long hair tied back and wearing a dark green top, trembles slightly. Her gaze shifts downward at first, then slowly rises to meet his intense stare. Both are shown in profile, facing each other.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, spacious area, possibly a ballroom or a large hall during an evening event. In the blurred background, indistinct figures of people can be seen, suggesting a gathering. A prominent, textured, light-colored pillar or wall section is visible on the left. The overall lighting is subdued, creating a dark ambiance.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium close-up shot. A man is positioned in the left foreground, shown in profile facing right. A woman is in the right foreground, in profile facing left. The man's dark-gloved hand is in the center foreground, pressing against the woman's left cheek, while a small, metallic, blade-like object is slightly to the right, held near her cheek and mouth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
