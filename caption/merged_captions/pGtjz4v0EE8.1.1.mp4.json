  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot capturing a large cathedral, specifically the Florence Cathedral, under a clear, deep blue sky during the day. Initially, a low-angle wide shot frames the ornate facade, which occupies the center and right portions of the frame in the middle ground. The Gothic structure is adorned with a polychrome marble pattern of white, green, and light brown. The intricate facade features multiple pointed arches, detailed carvings, and large circular rose windows. Statues are situated in niches across the building's front, with a prominent relief sculpture and a mosaic positioned above the central arched entrance. A portion of another building is visible on the far left, with the sky in the background at the top of the frame. The camera begins by moving forward and to the right, then executes a forward-rightward movement, shifting the composition and causing the building on the left to move out of the frame. The camera then trucks left while simultaneously panning right and tilting upward, bringing the upper, more detailed sections of the cathedral's central facade, including its large rose window, into full view. Throughout this movement, the camera glides across the ornate and detailed facade, allowing viewers to appreciate the intricate sculptures, carvings, and polychrome marble work. The shot concludes with a subtle zoom-in to highlight a specific architectural pattern on the building, with the central part of the facade filling the majority of the frame from a subtler low angle. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment itself, showcasing the building's artistic complexity and historical significance against the backdrop of a brilliant, clear blue sky.",

    "Subject": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, capturing a low-angle, panning view across the highly ornate facade of a massive cathedral. There is no single main subject, as the camera's deliberate movement across the vast, detailed surface is intended to convey the overwhelming scale and artistic complexity of the entire structure. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment itself, showcasing the building's intricate polychrome marble work in shades of white, green, and light brown, set against a brilliant, clear blue sky. The Gothic facade is densely decorated with pointed arches, numerous statues set within elaborate niches, detailed carvings, and large, circular rose windows, creating a powerful impression of historical and artistic significance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
