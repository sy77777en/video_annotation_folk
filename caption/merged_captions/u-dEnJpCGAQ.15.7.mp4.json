  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a young lion with tawny fur and light-colored eyes, positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame, standing amidst tall, dry grass with a hint of green. The lion occupies the middle ground, with the grass extending into the background, creating a natural savanna setting. The camera is at the lion's eye level, capturing its facial expressions as it opens its mouth, revealing its teeth and pink tongue, and wrinkles its nose. The lion's expression evolves as it narrows its eyes slightly, furrows its brows subtly, and draws back its lips slightly. The surrounding grass, with thin, leafless branches and sparse green shoots, fills the frame, providing texture and depth. Bright, natural light illuminates the scene, casting a slight sheen on the lion's tan fur and highlighting the texture of the surrounding grassland. The framing remains consistent throughout, maintaining focus on the lion's expressions and the immediate environment. The camera is slightly unsteady with some minor shaking but shows no clear or intentional movement. The shallow depth of field keeps the lion in focus, with dry grass visible in the lower left corner of the foreground, enhancing the scene's vividness.",

The camera is slightly unsteady with some minor shaking but shows no clear or intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "A young lion with tawny fur and light-colored eyes is shown in a close-up view. It stands amidst tall, dry grass, its mouth open, revealing its teeth and pink tongue. The lion's expression evolves as it wrinkles its nose, its eyes narrowing slightly, its brows subtly furrowing, and its lips drawing back slightly.",
    "Motion": "The young lion stands amidst tall, dry grass with a subtle hint of green, its mouth open, revealing its teeth and pink tongue. Its expression changes as it wrinkles its nose, narrows its eyes slightly, furrows its brows subtly, and draws back its lips slightly.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit savanna, a young lion stands amidst a field of tall, dry grass with a hint of green. The dense vegetation is punctuated by thin, leafless branches and sparse green shoots. Bright, natural light illuminates the scene, casting a slight sheen on the lion's tan fur and highlighting the texture of the surrounding grassland.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
