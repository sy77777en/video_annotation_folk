  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban intersection, capturing a broad view of the scene. The crosswalks are positioned towards the bottom left and the bottom right of the frame, extending from foreground to middle ground. Traffic lights are located in the middle ground, specifically in the top left corner and the center of the frame. Trees with sparse foliage line the left side of the frame, situated in the middle ground, while buildings appear in the background on the right side. Vehicles are entering the intersection, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead, and employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The video begins with a view of a street intersection featuring a crosswalk that extends from the foreground to the midground, with traffic lights positioned in the midground. The camera pans from left to right with slight unsteadiness, exhibiting some shaking, revealing more of the intersection and the surrounding area, including trees, buildings, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. A car is seen approaching the intersection from the right side of the frame, moving towards the center of the intersection. The car appears to be preparing to make a turn as it approaches the intersection. The environment is clean and organized, with clear road markings and pedestrian pathways. The scene maintains a neutral color palette, with the gray of the pavement contrasting against the greenery of the trees and the brick and concrete of the buildings. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, preserving a stable and comprehensive view of the intersection and its surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
