  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with minor camera movement, including zooming in and a slight clockwise roll. A large, ornate, golden-bronze statue of a male figure adorned with a laurel wreath occupies the foreground, positioned across the bottom half of the frame from the left towards the center. The statue's metallic surface reflects the ambient light. In the middle ground, the dark Seine River flows horizontally across the scene, with shimmering reflections from the city and several other bridges visible along its banks. Traffic moves rapidly across the bridge, and boats travel quickly along the river. The illuminated Eiffel Tower is centered in the background, rising above the sprawling, lit-up Parisian landscape against the dark night sky. The camera is positioned at a level angle relative to the scene, captured from an overhead, second-floor height. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground statue to the distant Eiffel Tower sharp. The shot features a very smooth and minor camera movement, slowly zooming in while rolling clockwise. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it. The video captures the grand scale, romantic atmosphere, and iconic beauty of the Parisian environment, with no single main subject, focusing instead on the breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from the Pont Alexandre III.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from the Pont Alexandre III. In the foreground, a large, ornate golden-bronze statue of a male figure adorned with a laurel wreath gazes out over the scene. Beyond the statue, the dark Seine River reflects the shimmering golden lights of the city, with several other bridges visible in the mid-ground. The background is dominated by the brilliantly illuminated Eiffel Tower, which stands as a beacon against the dark night sky, surrounded by the sprawling, lit-up Parisian landscape. The shot does not have a single main subject; instead, its focus is on capturing the grand scale, romantic atmosphere, and iconic beauty of the Parisian environment.",

    "Scene": "This outdoor night scene in Paris is captured from a bridge overlooking the Seine River. In the distance, the illuminated Eiffel Tower stands against the dark sky, with city lights lining the riverbanks. The foreground is dominated by a large, ornate, golden-bronze statue of a figure wearing a laurel wreath, its metallic surface reflecting the ambient light. The dark water of the river below shows shimmering reflections from the city and other distant bridges. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
