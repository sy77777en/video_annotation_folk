  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a rapid forward movement through a crowded street, with the camera positioned above eye level within the crowd. The dense crowd occupies both the center and bottom of the frame, extending from the middle ground towards the foreground. Tall buildings flank the scene on the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background, while market stalls are positioned along both sides in the middle ground. Suspended in the top center of the frame, several red lanterns are visible in the middle ground and background, appearing to move towards the foreground as the camera advances. A glowing green pharmacy cross is positioned on a building on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, eventually passing through the foreground and moving out of sight. The camera uses time-lapse photography to move through a crowded pedestrian street market, creating a significant motion blur effect as it navigates through the dense crowd of people. This steady, eye-level time-lapse video progresses through a bustling street market. The camera consistently maintains a level angle and employs deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp despite the rapid movement. The individuals in the crowd are indistinct due to motion blur, but they appear to be wearing a variety of casual and winter clothing, including dark jackets and hoodies. The market stalls, positioned along the sides of the street, have white awnings and display blurred goods. The scene, captured during the daytime, shows numerous people walking between shops and outdoor market stalls covered by white awnings. Wall lamps are visible across the street, although they are turned off. The entire perspective is characterized by a significant motion blur, creating a dynamic sense of speed through the bustling urban environment.",

    "Subject": "A large, dense crowd of people moves through a narrow street lined with market stalls and tall, light-colored stone buildings. The individuals in the crowd are indistinct due to motion blur, but they appear to be wearing a variety of casual and winter clothing, including dark jackets and hoodies. The market stalls, positioned along the sides of the street, have white awnings and display blurred goods. Suspended above the crowd are several round, red paper lanterns. A glowing green cross, indicative of a pharmacy, is visible on a building on the left side of the street.",
    "Motion": "The camera uses time-lapse photography to move through a crowded pedestrian street market, creating a significant motion blur effect as it navigates through the dense crowd of people.",
    "Scene": "A rapid forward-moving view travels down a narrow, crowded pedestrian street flanked by multi-story European-style buildings. The scene, captured during the daytime, shows numerous people walking between shops and outdoor market stalls covered by white awnings. Strung across the street above the crowd are several red, spherical paper lanterns. A glowing green cross, indicating a pharmacy, is visible on a building on the left. Wall lamps are visible across the street, although they are turned off. The entire perspective is characterized by a significant motion blur, creating a dynamic sense of speed through the bustling urban environment.",
    "Spatial": "A wide shot captures a rapid forward movement through a crowded street, with the camera positioned above eye level within the crowd. The dense crowd occupies both the center and bottom of the frame, extending from the middle ground towards the foreground. Tall buildings flank the scene on the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background, while market stalls are positioned along both sides in the middle ground.

A glowing green pharmacy cross is positioned on a building on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, eventually passing through the foreground and moving out of sight. The camera's swift forward motion creates significant motion blur primarily within the crowd, causing peripheral elements to streak past as the camera advances."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
