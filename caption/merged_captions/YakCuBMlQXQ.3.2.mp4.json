  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman with long, straight, platinum blonde hair and light skin, wearing a dark-colored jacket, positioned centrally in the frame, moving through a dense forest environment with tall, slender trees and a ground covered in grass and scattered fallen branches. The camera is at her height, capturing her upper body and head as she advances through the wooded area. The lighting suggests daytime, though the scene is shaded by the tree canopy, creating a subdued, cool-toned atmosphere. Trees and the forest floor fill the background, visible on all sides of the frame. The camera follows her from behind with unsteady, noticeably shaky movement, maintaining a level angle. As she continues moving, the camera pans from behind to the side, and the woman shifts from the center right to the left, then back to the center. The shot transitions to a close-up from the side, with her head and shoulders filling most of the frame, slightly shifted to the right. Her face is in sharp focus, with her head slightly lowered, revealing her neutral expression. The background trees remain visible but are more blurred, occupying the upper and left portions of the frame, while the forest floor is less prominent. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, starting with focus on the background and then performing a rack focus to bring the woman in the foreground into sharp focus. As the woman continues, the camera arcs counterclockwise around her, ending in a side profile as she stops. Throughout, the camera maintains a steady, eye-level perspective, with the woman consistently in the foreground as the central subject, her dark clothing contrasting with the natural surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level, consistently maintaining a level angle as it follows a woman with long blonde hair walking forward in a forest. The camera tracks her from behind and to the side, with unsteady, noticeably shaky movement. As the woman continues, the camera arcs counterclockwise around her, ending in a side profile as she stops. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, starting with focus on the background and then performing a rack focus to bring the woman in the foreground into sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with long, straight, platinum blonde hair and light skin, wearing a dark-colored jacket. Initially, the camera captures her from behind, where she is slightly out of focus. As the angle shifts to a side profile, the focus sharpens, revealing her facial features with her head slightly lowered. Her neutral expression is visible in these moments, and she remains the central focus throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The woman walks forward through a wooded area, with the camera following her from behind. As she continues moving, the camera angle shifts to her side, capturing her in profile as she lowers her head slightly while walking. She remains in motion throughout the video, with the camera adjusting its position to keep her in view.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a dense forest with tall, slender trees and a ground covered in grass and scattered fallen branches. The lighting suggests daytime, though the scene is shaded by the tree canopy, creating a subdued, cool-toned atmosphere. The environment features a mix of green and brown hues, with tree trunks displaying rough, dark bark. The forest floor is uneven, with visible roots and logs. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video. Motion is present as a figure with long, light-colored hair moves through the forest, their dark clothing contrasting with the natural surroundings.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman from behind, positioned centrally in the frame, moving through a forest environment that extends into the background on both sides. The camera is at her height, capturing her upper body and head as she advances through the wooded area. Trees and the forest floor fill the background, visible on all sides of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera pans from behind to the side, and the woman shifts from the center right to the left, then back to the center. The shot transitions to a close-up from the side, with her head and shoulders filling most of the frame, slightly shifted to the right. Her face is in sharp focus, with her head slightly lowered. The background trees remain visible but are more blurred, occupying the upper and left portions of the frame, while the forest floor is less prominent. Throughout, the camera maintains a steady, eye-level perspective, with the woman consistently in the foreground as the central subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
