  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a person's right hand, covered in a smooth, white glove, grips a small, black toggle switch with a distinct yellow band near one end and a metallic, silver-colored tip. The hand is positioned in the middle ground, moving a lever downward on a dark, industrial-looking control panel that occupies the center and right of the background. The panel features bold white text that reads \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" next to three large, yellow, downward-pointing arrows in the center, with an ON/OFF switch to the right, a red rectangular light at the top right, and a partially visible yellow warning sign at the bottom right. The lower left corner of the frame shows a blurred right forearm in the foreground, while the left side of the background is a blurred dark gray, making it difficult to discern any specific objects. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, with a smooth, level-angle, eye-level perspective and a shallow depth of field, focusing on the gloved hand in the midground as it interacts with the control panel. The camera moves forward slightly as the gloved hand adjusts the toggle switch from the upward position to the downward position on the control panel. The overall scene is characterized by low, cool-toned lighting in a dimly lit indoor setting.",

    "Subject": "A person's right hand, covered in a smooth, white glove, grips a small, black toggle switch with a distinct yellow band near one end and a metallic, silver-colored tip. The hand is moving a lever or joystick downward on a dark, industrial-looking control panel. The panel features yellow text that reads \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" above three yellow, downward-pointing arrows. To the right of this, there is a switch with \"ON\" and \"OFF\" labels, and a red rectangular light is visible at the top of the panel.",
    "Motion": "A gloved hand adjusts a toggle switch from the upward position to the downward position on a control panel.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a gloved hand moves the toggle switch on a dark control panel from the up position to the down position. The panel features a red indicator light at the top and bold white text that reads \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" next to three large, yellow, downward-pointing arrows. At the bottom of the panel, a yellow warning sign is partially visible. The overall scene is characterized by low, cool-toned lighting.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up shot, a gloved hand holding a cylindrical toggle switch is positioned in the middle ground, moving a lever downwards on a dark control panel that occupies the center and right of the background. The text \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" and three yellow arrows are visible in the center of the panel, with an ON/OFF switch to the right, a red light at the top right, and a partially visible warning sign at the bottom right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
