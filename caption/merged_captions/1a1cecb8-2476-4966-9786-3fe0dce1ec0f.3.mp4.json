  "merged_caption": "The video captures a shot of a street scene, focusing on a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask on the far left, occupying approximately 10% of the frame's width. This individual is positioned in the foreground on the left side, with their upper body visible and their head slightly turned towards the right. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the sequence, featuring mild barrel distortion with straight lines near the edges bowing outward. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves rightward to track the subject from the side, with noticeable shaking indicating unsteady movement. The person with pink hair is walking along a sidewalk, raising their right hand as they walk. The decorative metal railing with a stone base runs horizontally across the middle ground, extending from the left edge towards the center-right of the frame. In the background, a multi-story brick building with large windows is situated on the left side, while trees with green and purple foliage line the far side of the pedestrian walkway, occupying the background. The trees are positioned centrally and towards the right side of the frame. Street lamps with a warm glow are placed along the path, appearing in the middle ground on the right. The sky, overcast and diffused, forms the top portion of the background. The scene is set in an outdoor urban setting during the early evening, with a calm environment and no visible movement, suggesting a peaceful moment in the city. The camera maintains a steady perspective while moving rightward, capturing the serene ambiance of the street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
