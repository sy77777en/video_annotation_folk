  "merged_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person point-of-view, looking straight ahead from underneath a large, white structure that occupies the top and right portions of the frame. The structure extends from the top of the frame in the foreground, sweeping into the middle ground towards the center. A held white block is visible in the foreground at the bottom right. The background consists of a light blue sky on the left and a distant landscape visible far below in the bottom center. Several UI elements are overlaid: an inventory bar at the bottom center, prompts in the bottom left and right corners, a character avatar in the top left, and a crosshair in the center. The camera flies forward along the large, white structure, executing a sudden, brief upward movement. The player's view is aimed at the structure in the sky, with the view continuing to move forward until reaching a white column at the edge of the structure. The video shows a first-person perspective from the video game Minecraft, focusing on the construction of a large structure high in the sky. The structure is made of smooth, white blocks and is built in a stepped, layered fashion, creating a sweeping arc. The player appears well-prepared to actively add to the structure, as seen from the viewpoint of holding a white block. At the bottom of the screen, an inventory bar displays a selection of available blocks, including white, light blue, diamond, red, and black blocks. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the player character is visible, showing a figure with light skin, brown hair, a green shirt, and dark grey pants. The focus is deep, keeping the entire digital environment sharp.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a scene high in the sky of a Minecraft world. The view looks up along the underside of a massive structure made of white blocks. Far below, a flat landscape with some trees is visible. A light blue sky with blocky clouds can be seen behind and above the structure. Overlays are present on the screen. In the bottom center, an inventory hotbar displays various colored blocks, with the white block selected, next to an \"Inventory\" prompt in the bottom left. In the bottom right, controller prompts for actions like \"Drop\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small character icon is in the top left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
