  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures a bedroom where a light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a mustard-yellow and white striped, long-sleeved top with a peplum waist and blue jeans, is initially positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. She stands by the bed, which is covered by a large pile of clothes, many still on white hangers, dominating the left side of the bed that extends across the frame. The scene is set during the daytime, with a grey upholstered headboard, a wooden dresser on the far right holding a yellow candle and a tissue box, and several picture frames hanging on the white wall above. To the far left, a nightstand is in the middle ground with a round, black-framed mirror on the wall behind it, and a lit lamp with a white cylindrical shade. The woman grabs clothes from the bed and walks to the open sliding closet, initially empty, to hang them on the rack. She then turns and walks forward out of the closet, moving into the middle ground on the right side of the frame, where she stops beside the bed and leans over the pile of clothes, taking an item from the top and placing it on the bed. This fast-motion video, playing at a slightly accelerated speed, is captured from a static, eye-level, high-angle perspective, using a deep focus to keep the entire bedroom scene, including the woman and the pile of clothes, in sharp detail.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a bedroom during the daytime, where a large bed with a grey upholstered headboard is covered by multiple piles of clothing, much of it on white plastic hangers. To the right of the bed, a wooden dresser holds a yellow candle and a tissue box, with several picture frames hanging on the white wall above. To the left, a round, black-framed mirror is mounted on the wall above a nightstand featuring a lit lamp with a white cylindrical shade. In the background, an open sliding closet is initially empty until a woman with long dark hair, wearing a yellow and white striped top and jeans, places a pile of clothes inside.",

A large pile of clothes dominates the left side of the bed, which extends across the frame. To the far left, a nightstand is in the middle ground with a mirror on the wall behind it, while a dresser occupies the middle ground on the far right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
