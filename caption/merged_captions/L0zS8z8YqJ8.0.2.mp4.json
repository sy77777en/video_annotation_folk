  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of five metallic soldier figures, showing them from the waist up. They are arranged in a diagonal line, with the soldier on the right positioned in the foreground and the others receding into the middle ground towards the left against a light-colored, vertically paneled wooden wall. The figures appear to be made of a shiny, silver-colored metal, giving them a statuesque quality. Each soldier wears a military helmet and a uniform with a high collar and straps crossing the chest. The camera, positioned at the soldiers' level, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground row of silver soldier figurines. From a level, fixed Dutch angle, the shot begins with a very slow, smooth backward dolly away from the soldiers, which then accelerates quickly. As the camera continues to pull back, it pans slightly to the left, revealing that the soldiers are framed within a white window, which is located in the center of the screen. In the final composition, the white window frame occupies the foreground, while the soldiers are now seen in the middle ground through the window. The view is from outside a train car looking in, and bright light reflects off their polished surfaces. The statues remain motionless throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A row of at least five identical, human-like soldier figures are shown from the waist up. The figures appear to be made of a shiny, silver-colored metal, giving them a statuesque quality. Each soldier wears a military helmet and a uniform with a high collar and straps crossing the chest. They are all positioned standing at attention in a straight line, facing forward and slightly to their left. The view pulls back to reveal that the soldiers are seen through a white-framed window, as if they are passengers inside a train car.",
    "Motion": "The view gradually pulls back from a shot of a row of stationary, silver-colored soldier statues shown from the waist up, revealing that the scene is contained within a white frame. The statues remain motionless throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting against a light-colored, vertically paneled wooden wall, a row of silver, metallic soldier figurines stands at attention. The figurines wear helmets and uniforms with straps across their chests, and bright light reflects off their polished surfaces. The view slowly pulls back to reveal that the scene is actually seen through a train window.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of five metallic soldier figures, showing them from the waist up. They are arranged in a diagonal line, with the soldier on the right positioned in the foreground and the others receding into the middle ground towards the left against a background wall. The camera, positioned at the soldiers' level, then pulls back slowly. This movement reveals that the soldiers are framed within a white window, which is located in the center of the screen. In the final composition, the white window frame occupies the foreground, while the soldiers are now seen in the middle ground through the window."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
