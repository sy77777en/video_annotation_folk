  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot featuring the Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical sculpture with a distinctive greenish patina, standing tall on its multi-tiered, light brown stone pedestal on Liberty Island. The statue holds a torch aloft in its right hand and a tabula ansata in its left. Positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, the statue is surrounded by calm, gray-green water that extends from the foreground all the way to the background, occupying the lower portion of the frame. In the background, a distant city skyline with various buildings is visible under a pale blue sky with wispy white clouds, situated above the water and below the sky, which fills the upper portion of the frame. Bare trees and low-lying buildings are present on the island. The camera, positioned above the water at a level angle, maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. It executes a very smooth, shake-free movement, arcing around the Statue of Liberty while gradually moving forward to approach it. As the camera moves quickly across the water, the viewing angle of the monument shifts, and the water in the foreground ripples. The fast-motion video (1x-3x speed) captures the iconic landmark within its setting, maintaining a steady position at a moderate elevation, looking across the water towards the island.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot featuring the Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical sculpture, standing tall on its pedestal on Liberty Island. The statue, with its distinctive greenish patina, holds a torch aloft in its right hand and a tabula ansata in its left. The island is surrounded by gray-green water, and in the distant background, a hazy city skyline with various buildings is visible under a pale blue sky with wispy white clouds. The focus is on the iconic landmark within its setting.",
    "Motion": "The Statue of Liberty remains stationary as the camera moves quickly across the water, causing the viewing angle of the monument to shift. The water in the foreground ripples.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows the Statue of Liberty, a green, metal figure holding a torch, standing atop a multi-tiered, light brown stone pedestal on Liberty Island. The island is surrounded by calm, gray-green water. In the background, a distant city skyline is visible under a light blue sky with wispy white clouds. Bare trees and low-lying buildings are present on the island.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a wide scenery shot. The Statue of Liberty, on its pedestal on Liberty Island, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Water extends from the foreground all the way to the background, occupying the lower portion of the frame. In the background, a distant city skyline extends horizontally across the frame, situated above the water and below the sky, which fills the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a steady position at a moderate elevation, looking across the water towards the island."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
