  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a light-skinned, middle-aged man with short, dark hair is positioned slightly to the left of the center of the frame, viewed from outside his car through the front windshield. He is sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a dark collared shirt or jacket, and has both hands on the steering wheel as he looks forward. The windshield, with reflections of buildings on its surface, is in the foreground, while the man in the driver's seat occupies the middle ground. The camera remains locked at the man's level as the car moves through a city street, with a shallow depth of field prominently highlighting the car's windshield. The camera smoothly tracks the car from its front-right side, trucking right and backward to follow its movement, effectively showcasing the car's interior and the person inside. The interior of the car is dark, and the overall lighting of the scene is cool and subdued. Suddenly, an explosion occurs in the background, visible behind the man, causing him to turn his head to the left to observe it. As debris from the explosion approaches and nearly hits him, he quickly turns his head back and slightly lowers it to avoid the debris, while the car continues moving forward.",

    "Camera": "This is a locked-on POV shot with an eye-level, level-angle perspective. The camera features a shallow depth of field, prominently highlighting the car's windshield in the foreground. It smoothly tracks the car from its front-right side, trucking right and backward to follow its movement, effectively showcasing the car's interior and the person inside.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned, middle-aged man with short, dark hair is seen from the side, through the reflective glass of a car's windshield and driver-side window. He is sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a dark collared shirt or jacket, and has both hands on the steering wheel as he looks forward.",
    "Motion": "A man holds the steering wheel with both hands and looks forward while driving a car. Suddenly, an explosion occurs in the background, causing him to turn his head to the left to observe it. As debris from the explosion approaches and nearly hits him, he quickly turns his head back and slightly lowers it to avoid the debris, while the car continues moving forward.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on point of view mounted to the exterior of a vehicle, a man is seen at the wheel through the front windshield. The car moves through a city street, where reflections on the glass reveal passing buildings along the roadside. In the middle of the video, an explosion occurs in the background. The interior of the car is dark, and the overall lighting of the scene is cool and subdued.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned slightly to the left of the center of the frame, viewed from outside his car through the front windshield. The windshield, with reflections of buildings on its surface, is in the foreground, while the man in the driver's seat occupies the middle ground. The camera remains locked at the man's level as the car moves. In the middle of the video, an explosion occurs in the background, visible behind the man."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
