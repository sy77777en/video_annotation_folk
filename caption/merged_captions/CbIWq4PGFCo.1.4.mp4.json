  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a light-skinned young man with short, dark brown, slightly messy hair and light stubble on his face, wearing a dusty black shirt. He is positioned in the center of the foreground, with his head slightly turned toward the left, displaying a somber expression. The scene is set outdoors in a barren, sunlit landscape, with dry, light-brown earth creating a dusty and uneven surface. In the out-of-focus background, indistinct mounds of similar terrain are visible under warm, natural light, extending from the middle ground into the background. The camera, positioned at the man's level, employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on him. It performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around him, transitioning from a side view to a back view as he remains completely still, with his head slightly turned to the side.",

    "Camera": "At a level, eye-level angle, the camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the man in the foreground. The camera then performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around him.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned young man with short, dark brown, and slightly messy hair is shown from a side and back view. He has some light stubble on his face and is wearing a dusty black shirt. His head is slightly turned towards the left, and he has a somber expression.",
    "Motion": "The man remains completely still throughout the video, with his head slightly turned to the side.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a barren, sunlit landscape. The ground consists of dry, light-brown earth, creating a dusty and uneven surface. In the blurred background, indistinct mounds of similar terrain are visible under warm, natural light.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot frames a man from the shoulders up, positioning him in the center of the foreground. The camera performs a subtle counterclockwise arc around him, transitioning from a side view to a back view as he turns his head toward the left side of the frame. In the out-of-focus background, a barren, sunlit landscape extends from the middle ground into the background. The camera is positioned at the man's level throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
