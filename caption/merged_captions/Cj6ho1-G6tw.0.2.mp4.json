  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a full shot of a man on a bicycle, initially positioned in the middle ground, riding from the left side of the frame towards the right. He is wearing a red t-shirt with a white graphic on the chest, black pants, red and black gloves, and a multi-colored helmet, predominantly white with red, blue, and yellow sections and a Red Bull logo. The bicycle has an orange frame, black handlebars, a black seat, and black tires with distinctive bright green rims. He is framed between a stone pillar in the left foreground and another stone pillar in the right foreground. As he rides towards the camera, he moves into the foreground, becoming larger in the frame, before exiting at the bottom right corner. A stone wall is visible in the middle ground behind his initial path, with a black metal railing to its right. The camera follows his movement, initially positioned at the subject's eye level, and transitions smoothly upwards, shifting from eye level to an overhead position while maintaining a slightly elevated angle and using deep focus with a large depth of field. As the camera continues to move upward, it reveals a scenic view of a distant cityscape with various buildings, prominent spires, Calton Hill with its monuments, and the Firth of Forth in the distance, under an overcast sky. The cityscape and the sea are visible in the background, framed between the pillars and above the middle ground wall. Throughout the scene, the camera moves upward, transitioning to a wide shot as the man exits. This reveals more of the stone wall across the middle ground, now occupying the lower portion of the frame, and a more expansive view of the distant cityscape and the body of water in the background, which fills the upper portion of the frame, still framed by the two foreground stone pillars.",

    "Subject": "The video opens with a man on a bicycle. He is wearing a red t-shirt with a white graphic on the chest, black pants, and red and black gloves. A multi-colored helmet, predominantly white with red, blue, and yellow sections and a Red Bull logo, protects his head. The bicycle he rides has an orange frame, black handlebars, a black seat, and black tires with distinctive bright green rims. As the man rides from the midground to the foreground, he becomes more prominent in the frame before disappearing between two stone pillars. The camera then moves upward, revealing a view over a stone wall of a distant cityscape under an overcast sky, featuring various buildings and a body of water in the far background.",
    "Motion": "A man wearing a red t-shirt, black pants, and a multi-colored helmet rides an orange bicycle through a stone corridor. The camera follows his movement, moving upward as he moves out of the frame. The camera continues to move upward, revealing a scenic view of a distant cityscape with various buildings and a body of water in the background.",
    "Scene": "The video is set outdoors on a stone-paved area, likely a balcony or rampart of an old stone structure in Edinburgh, characterized by rough-hewn, grey and brown stone walls. A simple black metal railing lines part of the area. In the background, a panoramic view of the city unfolds under an overcast sky, featuring a mix of buildings, prominent spires, Calton Hill with its monuments, and the Firth of Forth in the distance. A person wearing a red t-shirt and a multi-colored helmet rides an orange and black bicycle, moving across the scene from left to right between stone pillars. As the camera continues to move upward, more of the cityscape is revealed beyond the stone wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
