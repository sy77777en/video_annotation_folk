  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot focused on the back of a woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a teal top, who occupies the right side of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the woman using a shallow depth of field, with the background blurred. To her left, a group of young women stands in a line in the middle ground, situated on the left side of the frame. They are dressed in various athletic outfits and have their heads turned to the right, facing the woman in the teal top, while their bodies are oriented towards the wall opposite them. The camera remains completely static, capturing the upper bodies of the group, indicating a medium shot for them. The woman in the foreground remains relatively still, while the young women exhibit slight arm movements. The background includes the interior of a spacious, well-lit room with white walls and a high ceiling, featuring exposed pipes and fluorescent lights. The environment appears to be a gym or studio, suggesting a setting related to sports or training. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene conveys a sense of organized activity or instruction, with the woman in the teal top as the central figure, seemingly observing or engaging with the group. The camera maintains a consistent angle throughout the scene, with no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position within the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
