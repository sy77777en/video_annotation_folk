  "merged_caption": "From a locked-on, full shot, a kayaker is positioned in the bottom center foreground, viewed from a back-facing perspective. The camera, mounted above this subject, captures their paddling movements as their arms and paddle move across the upper half of the frame. The kayaker, wearing a red, long-sleeved waterproof jacket, a black and green life vest, and a black helmet featuring a red and white \"Teva\" logo, holds a paddle with black blades. In the middle ground, a second kayaker in a red kayak and red attire remains consistently at the far right of the frame. The scene is flanked by dark, rough-textured canyon walls on the left and right sides, with turbulent whitewater filling the remaining space as the main kayaker moves forward through the gorge. From a high, eye-level perspective, the camera smoothly follows the kayaker from behind as they navigate through a narrow, shadowy canyon. The perspective follows a descent through the canyon, with the camera using various Dutch angles that align with the kayaker's paddling motion, though there is some noticeable shakiness. The kayaker paddles through the turbulent whitewater, using their paddle to make strokes on both sides, propelling the red kayak forward through the churning current. As they move downstream, the kayaker raises their right arm and makes a rock hand sign. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, capturing the fast-moving, foamy current in which the kayaker paddles. Further down the gorge, the second kayaker is visible navigating the same rapids.",

    "Subject": "A person is shown from a back-facing, point-of-view perspective while kayaking. This individual wears a red, long-sleeved waterproof jacket, a black and green life vest, and a black helmet featuring a red and white \"Teva\" logo. They are holding a paddle with black blades. In the distance ahead, another person in a red kayak and red attire is also visible navigating the water.",

    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a kayaker, the perspective follows a descent through a narrow, shadowy canyon. Dark, rough-textured rock walls rise steeply on both sides, confining a turbulent river of churning whitewater. The kayaker, clad in a red jacket and a helmet, paddles through the fast-moving, foamy current in a red kayak. Further down the gorge, another person in a red kayak is visible navigating the same rapids.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
