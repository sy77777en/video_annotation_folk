  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a dimly lit room with walls and a ceiling made of horizontal wooden slats, creating a moody and mysterious atmosphere. The scene opens with a close-up shot, where a black and white photograph of two intertwined hands hangs in the center middle ground from a wire stretched across the top of the frame, held by a binder clip. A string of small red bulbs is positioned in the top middle ground, casting a reddish glow on the scene, while a table occupies the bottom foreground. The camera starts by moving slightly backward from the photograph, maintaining sharpness throughout the scene with deep focus, then slowly pulls back and pans to the left, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals more of the environment. In the final framing, a piece of furniture covered by a white sheet is visible in the center-right middle ground, with a narrow hallway appearing in the right background. A lamp on a table is now seen in the bottom left foreground. The camera remains at a straight-on, eye-level height throughout the shot. The room is enveloped in an eerie red glow from the string of lights across the wooden-slatted ceiling, complemented by a prominent red lamp. A single bulb on the side of the hallway emits a contrasting white glow, adding to the ambiance. The dark, horizontal wooden panels of the walls and ceiling enhance the claustrophobic feel. A painting depicting two figures from behind hangs from a string, while a piece of furniture is shrouded under a white sheet. The focus is on establishing the environment's atmosphere, with the collection of objects and oppressive lighting telling a story about the space itself rather than highlighting a specific character or item.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
