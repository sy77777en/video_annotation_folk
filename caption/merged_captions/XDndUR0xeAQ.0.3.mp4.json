  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle close-up shot of a person's feet in black shoes and the cuffs of wide-legged black trousers, centered in the frame. A crumpled piece of purple fabric with a white swirling pattern is positioned in the top left corner on a plain, light-colored floor. The camera smoothly tilts upward, revealing the muscular upper body of an extremely muscular, dark-skinned man. As the perspective transitions into a low-angle medium shot, the man remains centered and towers over the camera's perspective. The expansive room is illuminated by overhead light fixtures and flanked on both sides by tall, dark bookshelves filled with books. The man, who has hair in the middle of his head, a thin mustache, and a slight smile, is shirtless, displaying a highly defined chest, abdomen, and arms. He wears the black trousers with a silver belt buckle and stands facing forward. The camera movement continues to reveal his powerful torso and face as he speaks in the library.",

    "Camera": "A smooth camera tilts upward, starting from a high angle on a muscular man's feet and turning to a low angle to reveal his powerful torso and face.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a high-angle shot of a person's feet in black shoes and the cuffs of wide-legged black trousers. On the floor to the left is a crumpled piece of purple fabric with a white pattern. The view tilts upward to reveal the full figure of an extremely muscular, dark-skinned man. He is shirtless, displaying a highly defined chest, abdomen, and arms, and wears the black trousers with a silver belt buckle. The man has hair in the middle of his head, a thin mustache, and a slight smile as he stands facing forward.",
    "Motion": "The camera tilts upward from a high-angle shot of a stationary, muscular man's feet, revealing his shirtless, muscular torso and arms, and finally framing his face as he speaks in a library. A piece of purple clothing falls to the ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a large room, illuminated by overhead light fixtures. The video begins with a high-angle view of a plain, light-colored floor, where a crumpled cloth made of purple fabric with a white swirling pattern rests on the left. The perspective slowly tilts upward, revealing the expansive room flanked on both sides by tall, dark bookshelves filled with books.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a high-angle close-up shot of a person's feet and lower legs, centered in the frame. A crumpled purple cloth is positioned in the top left corner. The camera then tilts upward, revealing the muscular upper body of a man. This movement transitions the frame into a low-angle medium shot, with the man remaining centered and towering over the camera's perspective."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
