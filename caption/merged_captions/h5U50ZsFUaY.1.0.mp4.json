  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, framing a person in a blue and black wingsuit slightly left of and above center from a low angle, wearing dark blue pants and a helmet. A large, reddish-brown rock formation dominates the bottom right of the foreground, set against a deep blue sky with wispy white clouds. The camera, in a very smooth aerial shot, begins at a low angle, looking up at the person against the sky, before tilting down to follow their descent past the large rock formation. The person is seen in a freefall position with their arms and legs spread out, gliding through the air and flying past the rock formation. As the camera rotates counter-clockwise while tilting down, transitioning to an extreme wide shot, it reveals the expansive desert terrain below, dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock formations with rugged, layered textures. A varying Dutch angle is used throughout, causing the horizon to roll dynamically. This movement repositions the person, who continues to move forward in free fall, to the center-left of the frame and at the camera's level. The vast canyon now occupies the foreground and middle ground at the bottom and left, with the rock formation remaining on the bottom right. The person then deploys a bright yellow-green parachute, gradually slowing their descent. The shot features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping both the skydiver and the expansive canyon below sharp and clear. The scene unfolds during the daytime near a prominent rock spire, with the perspective shifting to show the vast canyon below, completing the dynamic and visually engaging sequence.",

    "Subject": "A person is shown wingsuit flying, wearing a blue suit, dark blue pants, and a helmet. They are seen in a freefall position with their arms and legs spread out. Later, this person deploys a parachute that is bright yellow-green.",
    "Motion": "A person in a wingsuit glides through the air, flying past a large red rock formation. As the camera rotates to show a vast canyon below, the person continues to move forward in free fall before deploying a bright yellow-green parachute and gradually slowing their descent.",
    "Scene": "Set against a deep blue sky with wispy white clouds, the scene unfolds in a vast, arid canyon. The landscape is dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock formations with rugged, layered textures. During the daytime, a person in a blue and black wingsuit is seen in freefall near a prominent rock spire. The perspective shifts, revealing the expansive desert terrain below.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a wide shot, framing a person in a wingsuit slightly left of and above center from a low angle. A large, reddish-brown rock formation dominates the bottom right of the foreground, set against a sky background. The camera then rotates counter-clockwise while tilting down, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. This movement repositions the person, who has now deployed a parachute, to the center-left of the frame and at the camera's level. The vast canyon now occupies the foreground and middle ground at the bottom and left, with the rock formation remaining on the bottom right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
