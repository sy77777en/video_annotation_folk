  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a quiet residential street in Japan on a sunny day. Initially, a silver minivan occupies the foreground on the bottom left. Further into the scene on the left, in the middle ground, are a black car and then a white kei truck. Adjacent to these vehicles, a house with reddish-brown siding is in the left middle ground, bordered by a wooden slat fence that extends towards the center of the frame. Behind this fence, a prominent green tree stands in the center middle ground. The paved street begins in the middle-right of the foreground and shifts to the center as the camera, at eye level and maintaining a level angle, moves forward along the street. Initially facing slightly to the front left, the camera pans right to align with its forward direction, using a deep focus to keep a large depth of field sharp. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the camera moves forward, the vehicles, the adjacent house, the fence, and the tree on the left progressively shift towards the left edge of the frame. The tree remains partially visible, while the street reveals more of its length ahead. On the right side, a light blue house becomes more defined in the right middle ground, with power lines running along the street in the right middle ground and extending upwards. Distant communications towers are visible in the background, center-right, against the top sky. Shadows are cast on the pavement, indicating the bright sunlight. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the neighborhood, highlighting the typical suburban setting with traditional-style houses with tiled roofs lining the street.",

The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "This is a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet residential road in Japan on a sunny day. The camera moves forward along the paved street, which is lined with traditional and modern Japanese houses, some with wooden fences, small gardens and trees. Parked vehicles, including a silver minivan and a white kei truck, are visible in driveways. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the neighborhood, rather than a specific object or person, highlighting the typical suburban setting.",
    "Motion": "This video shows a quiet residential street in Japan on a sunny day. There are houses on either side of the road, with cars parked in driveways. The camera moves slowly down the street.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow, paved residential street in a Japanese neighborhood on a sunny day. On the left, a small parking area next to a house with a dark tiled roof and reddish-brown siding contains, from nearest to farthest from the camera, a silver minivan, a black car, and a white kei truck. The parking area is beside a wooden slat fence that borders a property with a prominent green tree. Traditional-style houses with tiled roofs line the street. Further down the road, a light blue house is visible on the right. Power lines and poles run alongside the street, and in the distance, other houses and two red and white communications towers can be seen against a clear blue sky. Shadows are cast on the pavement, indicating the bright sunlight.",

The power lines maintain their relative position on the middle-right, and the distant towers remain in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
