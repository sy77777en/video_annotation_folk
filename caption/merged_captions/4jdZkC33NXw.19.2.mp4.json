  "merged_caption": "This video presents a stationary wide shot of a suburban street scene, captured from an eye-level perspective. In the foreground, a paved sidewalk occupies the bottom left, while a flowerbed with yellow and purple flowers extends from the bottom right across the lower portion of the frame, with a black lamppost positioned in the center-right. The middle ground is dominated by a wet, two-lane road that curves from the right side of the frame towards the center-left, where cars are seen driving. This road is flanked by residential buildings, trees, and a small traffic island in the center-left. In the background, a large, netted golf driving range is visible in the center, with more houses and a dense network of power lines filling the upper portion of the frame against a cloudy sky. A blue and white sign is attached to a building in the top right. The camera moves forward and to the left with slight unsteadiness and shaking, capturing the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject. The focus is on the tranquil, everyday ambiance of the scene, with the lush flowerbed contrasting with the grey, wet conditions. The distinctive netting of the large golf driving range stands out against the cloudy sky, contributing to the scene's composition. The deep focus keeps the entire street scene sharp, allowing the viewer to take in the entire scene. The first-person POV shot captures the rainy day on a street in a Japanese suburb, with the pavement dark from the rain under an overcast sky. The video effectively conveys the movement and dynamics of the cars traveling along the wet road, enhancing the sense of a quiet suburban road in Japan on a rainy day.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot captures a rainy day on a street in a Japanese suburb. From a paved sidewalk, the view looks across a flower bed filled with yellow and purple blossoms towards a wet, two-lane road where cars are driving. The pavement is dark from the rain under an overcast sky. In the background, residential houses with tiled roofs, numerous overhead power lines, and a large, netted structure resembling a golf driving range are visible. A blue and white sign with Japanese characters is attached to a building on the right. A black lamppost stands in the flower bed, and green trees and shrubbery line the roadside.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
