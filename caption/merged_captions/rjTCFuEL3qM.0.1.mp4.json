  "merged_caption": "The scene features a static shot against a dark blue background, with a bright, cyan light source fixed at the top center of the frame. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light and a dense field of small, sparkling blue particles originate from various positions within the frame and continuously ascend towards this light source. The particles, resembling a dense starfield, twinkle as they drift upwards, while the longer, more defined streaks of light rise in parallel lines, creating a visual effect akin to a celestial or digital ascent. The streaks of light are present in the foreground, middle ground, and background, moving upwards in parallel lines. The sparkling particles are scattered throughout the frame, creating a sense of depth as they drift upwards and twinkle during their ascent. The camera remains completely static, capturing this view of ascending blue light particles against the dark background. A bright cyan glow radiates from the top center of the scene, enhancing the visual effect of a gentle, constant light shower converging towards the bright center across the dark expanse.",

    "Subject": "This video features an abstract animation set against a dark, deep-blue background. A bright, glowing light source is positioned at the top center, towards which countless small, sparkling blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of light ascend. The particles, resembling a dense starfield, twinkle as they drift upwards, while the longer, more defined streaks of light rise in parallel lines, creating a visual effect akin to a celestial or digital ascent.",
    "Motion": "Countless small, sparkling blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of light continuously ascend from various positions throughout the entire frame toward a bright light source at the top center. The particles twinkle as they drift upward, while the streaks of light move in parallel lines.",
    "Scene": "Against a dark, deep blue background, a bright cyan glow radiates from the top center of the scene. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light and a cascade of small, sparkling particles continuously ascend towards this light source. The particles glitter as they move upwards, creating a visual effect of a gentle, constant light shower converging towards the bright center across the dark expanse.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
