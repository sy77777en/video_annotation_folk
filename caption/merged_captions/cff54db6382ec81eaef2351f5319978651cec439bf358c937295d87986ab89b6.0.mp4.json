  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot with no main subject, presented as a close-up. Green, unripe wheat stalks are positioned in the foreground and extend into the background, occupying the lower two-thirds of the frame from the bottom edge upwards. A line of dark green trees and rolling hills is visible in the background, forming a horizontal band above the wheat field and below the main expanse of the sky. The sky fills the top third of the frame, featuring dark clouds towards the top and a band of lighter, warm-toned light along the horizon, directly above the distant trees, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The camera is positioned slightly higher than the wheat stalks, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on the midground wheat stalks. The camera is at a level angle and remains fixed throughout the video, but there is some unintentional shakiness. The scene is still, with no apparent movement in the wheat, emphasizing the scale of the wheat field and the atmospheric quality of the light rather than a specific object within it. The wheat in the middle ground is in focus and sharp, while the foreground and background elements are slightly blurred.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at a level angle, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on the midground wheat stalks. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a landscape scenery shot, featuring a vast field of green, unripe wheat stalks under a cloudy sky tinged with the warm hues of either dawn or dusk. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive natural environment and the atmospheric quality of the light, emphasizing the scale of the wheat field rather than a specific object within it.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a field of green wheat stalks under a cloudy sky at dusk. The camera provides a mostly static view of the landscape, with some unintentional shakiness.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a field of green wheat stalks, with their heads visible, extending towards a line of dark green trees and rolling hills in the distant background. The sky above is overcast with dark clouds, but a band of lighter, warm-toned light is visible along the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The wheat in the middle ground is in focus and sharp, while the foreground and background elements are slightly blurred. The scene is still, with no apparent movement in the wheat.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
