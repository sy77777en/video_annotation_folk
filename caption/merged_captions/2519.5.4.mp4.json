  "merged_caption": "A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 30s or 40s, is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupying the foreground. He has dark, somewhat messy hair and stubble on his face, wearing a dark jacket over a patterned sweater and a light-colored, unbuttoned collared shirt. The scene is set within a dark, enclosed interior, almost entirely consumed by shadow, with a single, direct light source from the left side of the frame illuminating his right face. This lighting highlights a sheen of sweat on his skin and a distressed expression with furrowed brows and a downturned mouth as he looks downward. The background is almost entirely dark, with the faint texture of a wooden surface, possibly a beam or part of the ceiling, discernible in the dimly lit upper right portion of the scene. The camera remains fixed at the man's level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on him in the foreground. This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from a low, eye-level angle. The man remains still and looks downward for most of the clip, but begins to move forward at the end.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, enclosed interior, almost entirely consumed by shadow. A single, direct light source from the side illuminates a man, casting the other half of his face and the background into near-total blackness. In the dimly lit upper right portion of the scene, the faint texture of a wooden surface, possibly a beam or part of the ceiling, is discernible.",
    "Spatial": "A man is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupying the foreground. The background is almost entirely dark, with a faintly visible wooden surface in the top right. The camera remains fixed at the man's level. At the end of the video, the man begins to move."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
