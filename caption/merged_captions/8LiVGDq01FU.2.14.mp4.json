  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot, positioning a man in the center-left foreground, viewed from his back and right side as he extends his arms forward and outstretched. He wears a light-colored helmet, a dark grey jacket with lighter grey or white straps forming a harness, light grey pants, and dark gloves. The scene unfolds within a dark, complex indoor environment characterized by seemingly infinite, parallel structures resembling vast stacks of books or files with varied muted colors, arranged in dense horizontal and vertical layers. The floor is a dark, reflective surface. The camera is positioned at hip level relative to the man, with a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man in the foreground. As the scene progresses, the parallel structures in the middle ground and background begin to fold, roll, expand, and shift in front of the man, with the metal sheets appearing to shift and rotate. The lighting changes, becoming brighter and more intense. The camera exhibits minor, smooth backward movement with minimal shaking, slowly rack focusing to the background. The focus shifts to the structures in the background, resulting in a transition to a wide shot, making the man appear smaller in the center-left foreground, while the vast, complex environment fills more of the frame. Finally, a bright white-yellow light erupts from the center background, expanding to engulf the background and silhouetting the man in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, enhancing the sense of motion as the horizontal elements rush past, culminating in an intense burst of light that transforms the intricate details into a bright, abstract expanse.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at hip level relative to a floating human, with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man in the foreground before slowly rack focusing to the background. The camera exhibits minor, smooth backward movement with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "A man, seen primarily from the back and side, wears a light-colored helmet, a dark grey jacket with lighter grey or white straps forming a harness, and light grey pants. He also wears dark gloves. His arms are often extended forward as if reaching or bracing himself.",
    "Motion": "The man is in a dimly lit industrial setting with metal sheets stacked in the background. As the frames progress, the background begins to change, with the metal sheets appearing to shift and rotate. The lighting also changes, becoming brighter and more intense. The man remains in a similar position throughout, with his arms extended forward and outstretched widely, suggesting he is either balancing or reaching out.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds within a dark, complex indoor environment characterized by seemingly infinite, parallel structures. These structures, resembling vast stacks of books or files with varied muted colors, are arranged in dense horizontal and vertical layers, creating a labyrinthine effect. The floor is a dark, reflective surface, mirroring the intricate geometry and sparse, bright lights that pierce the gloom. A figure, clad in a light helmet and a dark suit with light-colored harnesses, appears to float in this abstract space. As the environment shifts and expands, the horizontal elements rush past, enhancing the sense of motion. The scene culminates in an intense burst of bright, white-yellow light that engulfs the background, transforming the intricate details into a bright, abstract expanse.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium full shot, positioning a man in the center-left foreground, viewed from his back and right side as he extends his arms forward and outstretched. Surrounding him are dark, parallel structures in the middle ground and background, arranged in dense horizontal and vertical layers, with a dark, reflective floor at the bottom of the frame. As the scene progresses, the parallel structures in the middle ground and background begin to fold, roll, expand, and shift in front of the man. The focus shifts to the structures in the background, resulting in a transition to a wide shot, making the man appear smaller in the center-left foreground, while the vast, complex environment fills more of the frame. Finally, a bright white-yellow light erupts from the center background, expanding to engulf the background and silhouetting the man in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
