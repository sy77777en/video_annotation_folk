  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, extreme wide shot, the scene captures a bustling waterside plaza at St. Mark's Basin in Venice. Initially, the Doge's Palace is positioned in the upper right and center of the frame in the middle ground, with a large crowd of people filling the plaza to its left. The individuals are indistinct but are collectively seen wearing a variety of colorful casual attire in shades of red, blue, green, and white. In the middle ground on its left, two tall columns, each topped with a statue, stand amidst the crowd, although only one is visible. The foreground is dominated by the dark teal water of the lagoon, where numerous long, slender, blue gondolas are docked side-by-side along wooden docks, bobbing on the water. A single black gondola carrying several seated passengers is propelled across the water from right to left by a gondolier standing at its stern. As the camera performs a slight zoom-out and then trucks to the left, the Doge's Palace shifts to occupy only the right edge of the frame, and both columns become visible, with one near the center and the other on the left. The camera, while maintaining its elevated position, subtly trucks to the left to follow the gondola's path as it moves leftward across the foreground water. The time-lapse video captures the dynamic movement of the crowd walking in various directions, enhancing the bustling atmosphere of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video captured from a high-angle, aerial-level with a deep focus. The camera performs a slight zoom-out and then trucks to the left, tracking a boat as it moves along the water.",
    "Subject": "From a high-angle, extreme wide perspective, a large crowd of people populates a waterside plaza. The individuals are indistinct but are collectively seen wearing a variety of colorful casual attire in shades of red, blue, green, and white. Along the waterfront, numerous long, slender, blue gondolas are docked side-by-side. A single black gondola carrying several people moves across the water. A figure, the gondolier, stands at the stern, propelling the boat forward, while a few passengers are seated in the main body of the vessel.",
    "Motion": "In a bustling waterside plaza, a large crowd of people walks in various directions. While numerous blue gondolas remain docked along the waterfront, bobbing on the water, a single black gondola carrying several seated passengers is propelled across the water from right to left by a gondolier standing at its stern.",
    "Scene": "An elevated, observational shot captures a bustling daytime scene at St. Mark's Basin in Venice. On the right, the distinctive Doge's Palace features an orange and white diamond-patterned upper level above a white stone loggia with Gothic arches. To the left of the Doge's Palace, two tall columns, each topped with a statue, stand amidst a large crowd of people on the stone-paved waterfront. The foreground is dominated by the dark teal water of the lagoon, where numerous blue gondolas are moored along wooden docks. A single gondola with passengers glides across the water.",

The camera, while maintaining its elevated position, subtly trucks to the left to follow the gondola's path."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
