  "merged_caption": "This close-up, high-angle shot shows a white sheet of paper positioned centrally in the foreground, resting on a dark brown wooden surface in the background. The paper, which fills most of the frame, has the text \"WRITING SECTION\" at the top center and the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" below it, followed by several blank horizontal lines. A full light-skinned hand with a short, clean nail holds the paper at the bottom right corner of the frame, while another hand holds a pencil in the bottom left corner. To the right, a partial, stylized illustration of a DNA double helix with cross-hatching is visible on a second sheet of paper tucked underneath the top one. The video features a static image with the paper held steady on the wooden surface. From a high angle, the smooth camera zooms in on the piece of paper, offering a clearer view of the text and focusing more closely on the details of the paper and illustration. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping all text sharp. The scene is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, showing the white sheet of paper held over the dark brown wooden surface.",

    "Subject": "A white sheet of paper labeled \"WRITING SECTION\" rests on a dark brown wooden surface. The heading is in a black, capitalized, serif font, followed by the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" and several blank horizontal lines. A full light-skinned hand with a short, clean nail holds the paper at the bottom right corner. In the bottom left corner, another hand holds a pencil. Beneath the \"WRITING SECTION\" paper, there is a separate sheet featuring a partial, stylized illustration of a DNA double helix with cross-hatching.",
    "Motion": "The video features a static image with a piece of paper containing a writing prompt, held steady on a wooden surface. The camera effectively zooms in on the writing prompt, offering a clearer view of the text.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a white sheet of paper held over a dark brown wooden surface. At the top of the paper, the heading \"WRITING SECTION\" is printed in bold, capital letters. Below it, the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is written, followed by several blank lines. A small, black-and-white illustration resembling a DNA helix is visible on a sheet of paper beneath the top page. Two hands are holding the paper in place.",

The paper, which fills most of the frame, has the text \"WRITING SECTION\" at the top center and the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" below it. A finger holds the paper at the bottom right corner of the frame. To the right, a partial illustration of a DNA helix is visible on a second sheet of paper tucked underneath the top one.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
