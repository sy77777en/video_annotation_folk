  "merged_caption": "The camera slightly moves forward in an over-the-shoulder shot, maintaining a smooth, eye-level perspective. In the foreground, the shoulder and side of a person's head, who is wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt, occupy the left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at their shoulder height, looking forward into the middle ground and background, which consists of a dark forest. A focused light source illuminates the center of the frame, revealing a single, light-colored shoe with a dark sole hanging partway up one of the tree trunks in the middle ground, surrounded by other bare tree trunks. The person in the foreground and the shoe hanging from the tree remain stationary throughout the video. The view is into a dense forest at night, where a focused beam of light cuts through the darkness to illuminate a small area. The light reveals numerous tall, slender, and bare tree trunks rising from a ground covered in dry, brown leaves and underbrush. The camera's focus is indistinct due to the low-light conditions, and the camera angle is level.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, eye-level perspective, the camera moves forward slightly, pointed towards trees in a dark forest. The camera's focus is indistinct due to the low-light conditions. Additionally, the camera angle is level.",
    "Subject": "An over-the-shoulder shot shows the back of a person's shoulder and head. The person is wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt. In the distance, a light illuminates a dark forest of bare trees, revealing a single, light-colored shoe with a dark sole hanging from a tree branch.",
    "Motion": "The person in the foreground and the shoe hanging from the tree in the middle ground remain stationary throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character wearing a blue hooded garment, shows the scene ahead. The view is into a dense forest at night, where a focused beam of light cuts through the darkness to illuminate a small area. The light reveals numerous tall, slender, and bare tree trunks rising from a ground covered in dry, brown leaves and underbrush. In the center of the illuminated patch, a small, grey and black shoe is visible hanging partway up one of the tree trunks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
