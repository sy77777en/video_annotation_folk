  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, positioning one man in the left foreground with his side and back to the camera, and a second man in the right middle ground, facing him. The man on the left has a buzz cut and is wearing a dark denim jacket, while the man on the right has short, curly hair and is dressed in a dark leather jacket over a brown shirt. The background is filled with the ornate architecture of a building's interior, including decorative columns and intricate moldings, with a decorative column in the center-right. The environment is a grand, ornate building with classical architectural elements, and the walls are adorned with detailed carvings and a mix of soft, muted colors like beige and cream. The setting appears to be well-lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through unseen windows. The floor is scattered with debris, adding a slightly neglected feel to the otherwise elegant surroundings. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground using a shallow depth of field. The man on the right, wearing a leather jacket and brown shirt, smiles and looks down, then looks up at the man on the left, conversing with him and making natural hand gestures while holding an item in his hand. The man in the foreground then begins to walk to the right, and the camera gently pans to follow, transitioning the framing into a close-up that focuses more on the man in the foreground. The camera pans from left to right, following the movement of the two men engaged in conversation, capturing a sense of historical grandeur with its elaborate design and spacious layout.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
