  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a man in a clown mask in the foreground at the center, with a third masked man visible in the middle ground through a central doorway, while the second man is obscured by the first man. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle with a handheld perspective. Initially stationary with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground, it begins a smooth pan to the left as three masked intruders enter the building. The first man, positioned more to the left, wears a clown mask with blue paint around the eyes, red paint around the mouth, and no eyebrows, and is dressed in a dark jacket. A second man, initially behind the first, also wears a similar clown mask and dark clothing, and is seen raising a dark handgun. A third man, also in a clown mask and dark attire, is briefly visible running. His mask features red paint around the eyes, blue paint around the mouth, and blue eyebrows. As the men run forward, the camera follows them, and the shot transitions to a full shot. In this new framing, all the men are seen running away from the camera down a long corridor, moving from the foreground toward the background sequentially. The scene unfolds within a long indoor corridor, characterized by light-colored walls. The floor is smooth, light-colored, and highly reflective. Bright, even illumination fills the space, supplemented by light from windows visible in the background. The second and third men wear masks with blue eyebrows. The third man glances over his shoulder as they all sprint down the long hallway, with none of them removing their masks during the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",

    "Motion": "Three men in clown masks exit a room sequentially into a hallway. The second and third men wear masks with blue eyebrows. The third man glances over his shoulder as they all sprint down the long hallway, with none of them removing their masks during the scene.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds within a long indoor corridor, characterized by light-colored walls. The floor is smooth, light-colored, and highly reflective.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
