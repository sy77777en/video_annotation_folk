  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a lone skier positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera, which exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains deep focus, begins at an overhead level and smoothly descends to eye level while tracking the skier from the front and above. The skier, wearing a bright orange jacket over dark pants, along with a dark-colored helmet and goggles, is holding a ski pole in each hand and is on two dark skis. They descend a wide, groomed, snow-covered slope, moving directly toward the camera in a straight line, maintaining a consistent downward path without making any turns, and gliding smoothly over the snow. The camera's movement is backward and down the slope, following the skier's descent. Trees line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background, where snow-covered mountains are visible across the top of the scene. Dense lines of evergreen and bare trees border both sides of the slope. In the distance, snow-covered mountain peaks rise against a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. A distinct shadow cast by a ski lift tower appears on the snow in the lower right portion of the view, transitioning from the lower right foreground to the right side of the middle ground. The vast expanse of white snow is marked with tracks, and the skier remains in the middle ground throughout the shot, descending the mountain on a sunny day.",

    "Camera": "This video, which exhibits mild barrel distortion, is shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera begins at an overhead level and smoothly descends to eye level while tracking a skier from the front and above. The camera's movement is backward and down the slope, following the skier's descent.",
    "Subject": "A person is seen skiing down a wide, snow-covered slope, facing the camera. The skier wears a bright orange jacket over dark pants, along with a dark-colored helmet and goggles. They are holding a ski pole in each hand and are on two dark skis, descending the mountain.",
    "Motion": "A skier descends a wide, snow-covered slope, moving directly toward the camera in a straight line. They maintain a consistent downward path without making any turns, gliding smoothly over the snow.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone follows a lone skier down a wide, groomed ski slope on a sunny day. The vast expanse of white snow is marked with tracks, and the skier, wearing an orange jacket, is positioned in the center, descending the mountain. Dense lines of evergreen and bare trees border both sides of the slope. In the distance, snow-covered mountain peaks rise against a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. A distinct shadow cast by a ski lift tower appears on the snow in the lower right portion of the view.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme wide shot captures a lone skier positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera, facing a steep ski slope, follows the skier as they descend, remaining in the middle ground throughout the shot. Trees line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background, where snow-covered mountains are visible across the top of the scene. A large shadow cast by a ski lift tower transitions from the lower right foreground to the right side of the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
