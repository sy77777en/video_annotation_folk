  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of an anime character's lower body in a crouch, positioned in the center of the frame on a green soccer field with vibrant, bright green turf marked by a white line. The character, a young man with very long, flowing black hair and light-colored eyes, is wearing a red sleeveless athletic jersey with black stripes over a black long-sleeved undershirt that has purple stripes on the arms, along with matching red shorts over black leggings, and black and white cleats. Black nail polish is visible on his fingernails, and a patch is visible on his left sleeve. The camera then performs a quick, smooth upward tilt, capturing the character as he rises from his crouch. As the camera moves up, it frames his face against a stark, overexposed white background. The character begins to speak, and his long black hair flows and spins dynamically around his head as he turns to look forward with a focused expression. His hair occupies the top and left portions of the frame, while his left arm is raised in the foreground on the left. The setting is brightly lit, enhancing the dynamic motion of his hair and the intensity of his focused gaze.",

    "Subject": "An anime character, a young man with very long, flowing black hair and light-colored eyes, is depicted on a green field. He wears a red sleeveless athletic jersey with black stripes over a black long-sleeved undershirt that has purple stripes on the arms. His attire is completed with matching red shorts over black leggings, and black and white cleats. The character, who has black nail polish on his fingernails, is initially seen in a low crouch before transitioning to a more upright, dynamic pose where his hair whips around his face as he looks forward with a focused expression. A patch is visible on his left sleeve.",
    "Motion": "An anime character initially crouches slightly on a green field. As the camera executes a quick, smooth upward tilt, it captures the character rising. The character begins to speak, and their long black hair flows and spins dynamically around their head as they turn to look forward with a focused expression.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds on a soccer field with vibrant, bright green turf marked by a white line. The setting is brightly lit. The perspective shifts to a medium shot to show an anime character's upper body against a stark, overexposed white background, where a person's long black hair flows dynamically. The individual is wearing a red jersey with black stripes over a black long-sleeved undershirt, along with black and white cleats.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person's lower body in a crouch, positioned in the center of the frame on a green field. The camera then performs a quick, smooth upward tilt, starting from the crouching soccer player and moving up to frame their face against a solid white background. Their long hair flows dynamically, occupying the top and left portions of the frame, while their left arm is raised in the foreground on the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
