  "merged_caption": "This video opens with a wide, eye-level shot of a street scene, captured from a forward-moving perspective that pans left. Captured from an unsteady, eye-level perspective with a fisheye lens, this video showcases significant distortion and a deep depth of field. Initially, the frame features a distorted view of the road in the foreground, with a stone wall positioned in the middle ground at the center of the scene. As the pan progresses, the road extends from the bottom of the frame into the left background. The stone wall, a park-like area, and a traffic light are situated in the middle ground on the right side of the scene. The park area extends along the road from the right side to the left middle ground. This point-of-view video captures a journey along a tree-lined city street, passing a low stone wall and a traffic light under an overcast sky. A paved road with white lane markings runs alongside a low, light-colored stone wall. Beyond the wall is a park-like area with numerous tall, mostly bare-branched deciduous trees and some dark green evergreen trees. A traffic light on a yellow pole is green, and a white \"ONE WAY\" sign is visible. As the view moves, a person with pink hair, black glasses, and a black face mask comes into view on the left. As the pan concludes, a person with pink hair enters and occupies the bottom-left foreground, while the composition settles with the road stretching into the left background. The camera consistently moves forward, maintaining a dynamic perspective as it crosses a road and briefly pans left to view the street. The focus is on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the street, presenting the scale and character of the location rather than highlighting a specific individual or object.",

The road is bordered by a low stone wall and a park-like area with numerous trees—some still bare-branched and others with new green leaves.

    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the perspective initially pans left along an urban street on an overcast day. After panning, the camera maintains its leftward orientation while continuing to move forward in the original direction. A paved road with white lane markings runs alongside a low, light-colored stone wall. Beyond the wall is a park-like area with numerous tall, mostly bare-branched deciduous trees and some dark green evergreen trees. A traffic light on a yellow pole is green, and a white \"ONE WAY\" sign is visible. As the view moves, a person with pink hair, black glasses, and a black face mask comes into view on the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
