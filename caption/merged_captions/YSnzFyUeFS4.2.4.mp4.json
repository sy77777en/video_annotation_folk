  "merged_caption": "This shot is framed from a bird's-eye view, first-person perspective, looking down towards the ground. The lower body of the person filming occupies the bottom-center foreground, with their right hand holding a black camera in the bottom-right and their left hand visible in the bottom-left. As the person walks forward along a paved sidewalk, their legs move in a steady walking gait, and a white-sneakered foot moves in the center of the frame, while the concrete sidewalk that fills the scene appears to move from the top of the frame towards the bottom. The movement is unsteady and shaky, and noticeable fisheye distortion curves the lines of the pavement. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The individual is wearing a dark gray t-shirt and mauve-colored shorts. The camera maintains a steady downward angle, showing the person's legs and feet moving forward with each step. The ground is paved with large, light gray concrete slabs. The right hand holds a black camera with a lens, secured by a black wrist strap, while the left hand swings naturally at their side.",

    "Camera": "This first-person, bird's-eye view shot is filmed from around eye level, pointing directly down at the ground as the person walks forward. The movement is unsteady and shaky, and noticeable fisheye distortion curves the lines of the pavement. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person point of view, a person with a light skin tone is seen walking. He is wearing a dark gray t-shirt and mauve-colored shorts, and a white sneaker. In his right hand, he holds a black camera with a lens, secured by a black wrist strap, while his left hand is visible at his side.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective looking down, a person walks forward along a paved sidewalk. Their legs move in a steady walking gait, and their left arm swings naturally at their side while their right hand holds a camera, which moves in rhythm with their steps.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view looking down as a person walks along a sidewalk during the day. The ground is paved with large, light gray concrete slabs. The individual is wearing purple shorts, a dark t-shirt, and white sneakers. In their right hand, they hold a black camera secured with a wrist strap, while their left hand swings by their side. The camera maintains a steady downward angle, showing the person's legs and feet moving forward with each step.",
    "Spatial": "This shot is framed from a bird's-eye view, first-person perspective, looking down towards the ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
