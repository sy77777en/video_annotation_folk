  "merged_caption": "In a static, wide, high-angle shot, a single, white, semi-translucent toilet with its lid open is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. It sits on a continuous dark, slightly reflective surface that extends seamlessly from the foreground to the background, though the lack of detail and lighting makes it challenging to confirm this with certainty. The background is completely black. The toilet remains completely stationary in the center of the frame throughout the video. From a high, overhead angle, the camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves slowly and smoothly forward, downward, and arcs slightly counterclockwise, gradually approaching the glowing toilet at the center of the frame. The interior of the toilet bowl emits a soft blue glow, representing water, and a soft light source highlights the surface directly beneath the toilet, creating a gentle glow that fades into the darkness. A white text subtitle displaying the number \"[7]\" is located at the bottom left of the screen.",

    "Subject": "A white, semi-translucent toilet is positioned in the center of a solid black background. The toilet has its lid open, revealing the interior of the bowl, which is illuminated from within by a bright, cool blue light that seems to represent water. A soft light source highlights the surface directly beneath the toilet, creating a gentle glow that fades into the darkness.",

    "Scene": "A single, white toilet with its lid open is positioned in the center of a dark, undefined space. The toilet rests on a dark, slightly reflective surface, illuminated by a soft spotlight from above. The interior of the toilet bowl emits a soft blue glow. The background is entirely black. A white text subtitle displaying the number \"[7]\" is located at the bottom left of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
