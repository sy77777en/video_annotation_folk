  "merged_caption": "The video features a snowboarder captured in a full shot, positioned centrally within the frame, wearing a gray ski hat, goggles, a blue jacket, and dark pants. A visible selfie stick is in the foreground at the center bottom of the frame, held in the snowboarder's right hand, while their left hand is extended for balance. The snowboarder is in the foreground, with snow-covered trees on both sides of the frame, snow-laden slopes, and an overcast, snowy sky forming the background. The camera, positioned at hip level, employs a low angle that looks upward and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves smoothly backward and downward, leading the snowboarder from the front. As the snowboarder swiftly navigates through deep, powdery snow in a forested area, they maneuver between snow-covered trees, creating a spray of snow that partially obscures the view. This dynamic movement demonstrates skillful snowboarding and adds a sense of motion. The tall evergreen trees, heavily laden with snow, frame the scene, enhancing the depth and creating a tunnel-like effect as the snowboarder moves dynamically through the snowy landscape. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, highlighting the whiteness of the snow and the dark green of the trees. The camera remains steady, focusing on the snowboarder's swift maneuvers and the surrounding environment, while the mild barrel distortion subtly affects the video. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic movement and skillful maneuvering through the snowy landscape, with the snowboarder's high speed causing snow to spray up around them, adding energy and partially obscuring the view.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at hip level, employing a low angle that looks upward. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly backward and downward, leading the subject (a snowboarder) from the front.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person snowboarding through deep snow in a forested area. The snowboarder is wearing a gray ski hat and goggles, a blue jacket, and dark pants. They are captured from a selfie angle, likely using a selfie stick, as they navigate through snow-covered trees. The snowboarder is holding the selfie stick with their right hand while using their left hand to maintain balance. They are moving at a high speed, creating a spray of snow around them, which partially obscures the view. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic movement and skillful maneuvering through the snowy landscape.",
    "Motion": "The snowboarder swiftly navigates through deep snow in a forested area, holding a selfie stick in their right hand.

As they move at high speed, they create a spray of snow that partially obscures the view, demonstrating dynamic and skillful snowboarding.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a dynamic scene in a snowy, forested landscape during the day. It is shot from a selfie POV, with the camera facing the person holding it, who is snowboarding through deep, powdery snow. Tall evergreen trees, heavily laden with snow, frame the scene, creating a dense, wintry backdrop. The snowboarder, dressed in blue and wearing goggles, moves swiftly, causing snow to spray up around them, adding a sense of motion and energy. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, showing the whiteness of the snow and the dark green of the trees.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a snowboarder captured in a full shot, positioned centrally within the frame. A visible selfie stick is in the foreground at the center bottom of the frame. The snowboarder is in the foreground, with snow-covered trees on both sides of the frame, snow-laden slopes, and an overcast, snowy sky forming the background. The camera, held at the snowboarder's level using the selfie stick, maintains a consistent angle as the snowboarder moves dynamically through the scene. The snowboarder's movement causes snow to spray, partially obscuring the view and adding a sense of motion. The trees frame the scene on both sides, enhancing the depth and creating a tunnel-like effect as the snowboarder navigates through the snowy landscape. The camera remains steady, focusing on the snowboarder's swift maneuvers and the surrounding environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
