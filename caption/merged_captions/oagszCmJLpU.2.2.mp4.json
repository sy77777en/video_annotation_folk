  "merged_caption": "This scenery video features a dynamic extreme wide shot from a low angle, looking up at the sky. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left, capturing a vast expanse of dark, roiling storm clouds that occupy the top and central portions of the frame in the background. The video is a time-lapse of a powerful thunderstorm at night, with massive, turbulent clouds illuminated from within by frequent flashes of pink, purple, and white lightning. The primary visual activity consists of these frequent lightning flashes that illuminate the base of the clouds from within, concentrated in the bottom-center of the frame just above the horizon. The dramatic atmospheric event dominates the entire sky, creating a spectacular and ominous light show against the dark horizon. A thin, dark silhouette of a flat landscape runs along the bottom of the frame in the foreground, with the ground below appearing as a dark silhouette. A single, small, stationary yellow light is visible in the far background on the bottom left, situated on the horizon line, accentuating the vastness of the landscape. The sky is filled with deep blue and black turbulent clouds, which are continuously and dramatically illuminated from within by pulsating flashes of pink, purple, and white lightning. The light from the storm flashes continuously as the cloud structures churn and evolve, creating pulsing glows that spread across the horizon. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the immense scale and power of the storm rather than a specific main subject.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video captures a dramatic storm from a low angle, positioned somewhere between eye-level and overhead. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left, following the movement of the storm clouds.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night over a vast, dark plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the immense scale and power of the storm rather than a specific main subject. The sky is filled with deep blue and black turbulent clouds, which are continuously and dramatically illuminated from within by pulsating flashes of pink, purple, and white lightning, creating a spectacular and ominous light show against the dark horizon. A single, tiny, steady yellow light is visible in the far distance on the left, accentuating the vastness of the landscape.",
    "Motion": "This video is a time-lapse of a powerful thunderstorm at night. The camera pans from right to left across a dark, flat landscape as massive, turbulent clouds are illuminated from within by frequent flashes of pink and white lightning. The dramatic atmospheric event dominates the entire sky.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse shows a thunderstorm at night over a flat, dark landscape. The sky is filled with massive, roiling storm clouds in shades of deep blue and black. Frequent flashes of intra-cloud lightning illuminate the cloud base from within, creating pulsing glows of pink, purple, and bright white light that spread across the horizon. The ground below is a dark silhouette, with a single, distant yellow light visible on the far left. The light from the storm flashes continuously as the cloud structures churn and evolve.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
