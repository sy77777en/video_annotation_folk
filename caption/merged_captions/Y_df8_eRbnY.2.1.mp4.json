  "merged_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a broad riverside landscape, with the winding river occupying the left and bottom left of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while the narrow road runs parallel to the river along the lower and middle right of the frame, also in the foreground and middle ground. Dense, leafless trees fill the right and upper portions of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background, while low hills and a clear sky are visible in the distant background at the top of the frame. A white car is visible on the road near the lower center, but it remains small and secondary within the expansive scene. The camera is positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looking down over a river bend and adjacent forest. It uses deep focus, keeping both the river and the surrounding landscape sharp. The camera trucks right while simultaneously panning left to showcase the natural scene, maintaining very smooth and steady movement throughout. The video captures a sweeping view of a winding river bordered by dense, leafless trees and a narrow road that curves alongside the water. The river has a calm, reflective surface with a deep blue-green color, bordered by rocks and sparse vegetation. On one side of the road, there is a dense area of leafless trees and shrubs in muted brown and gray tones, suggesting late autumn or early winter. The terrain is mostly flat, stretching into the distance with low hills visible on the horizon under a clear, pale blue sky. The emphasis remains on the expansive setting and tranquil atmosphere, rather than any specific object or individual.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a sweeping view of a winding river bordered by dense, leafless trees and a narrow road that curves alongside the water. A white car travels along the road, adding a subtle dynamic element, but it is not the primary focus. The scene extends into the distance, revealing a vast expanse of forested terrain and low hills under a clear sky, emphasizing the natural environment and the scale of the landscape. The emphasis remains on the expansive setting and tranquil atmosphere, rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "Motion": "This video features a scenic view of a winding river bordered by a road and dense, leafless trees, likely in late autumn or early winter. A white car is driving along the road adjacent to the river. The landscape extends into the distance with a clear sky overhead.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor riverside landscape during the day, with a winding road running parallel to the water’s edge. The river has a calm, reflective surface with a deep blue-green color, bordered by rocks and sparse vegetation. On one side of the road, there is a dense area of leafless trees and shrubs in muted brown and gray tones, suggesting late autumn or early winter. The terrain is mostly flat, stretching into the distance with low hills visible on the horizon under a clear, pale blue sky. There are no overlays or visible weather effects, and the scene remains steady as the drone moves smoothly above the landscape, capturing the natural features and the quiet, expansive environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a broad riverside landscape, with the winding river occupying the left and bottom left of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while the narrow road runs parallel to the river along the lower and middle right of the frame, also in the foreground and middle ground.

A white car is visible on the road near the lower center, but it remains small and secondary within the expansive scene. The camera, positioned high above the landscape, maintains a steady, elevated perspective throughout, emphasizing the scale and spatial relationships between the river, road, forest, and distant hills without significant changes in shot size or subject position."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
