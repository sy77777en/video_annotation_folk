  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot frames a light-skinned man's head in the bottom center foreground, with a long, green celery stalk extending vertically from his mouth up through the center of the frame. He wears a red baseball cap backward and looks directly upward. In the middle ground, another person's hand is positioned to the left of the celery, and a portion of their head with short brown hair is visible to the right. The background is composed of dark, blurred foliage. The camera is static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, and employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The video uses a speed ramp effect, alternating between slow and regular motion. A playing card enters from the center, travels horizontally across the middle of the frame, and slices the celery stalk in the center. The hand throws the playing card, which flies through the air and slices the vertically balanced celery stalk in half. The impact sends the top portion of the celery flying, while the bottom half remains balanced in the mouth of the man in the foreground. The card continues its trajectory and falls away to the left after cutting the stalk. The top portion of the celery then falls downward, while the man and the bottom half of the celery remain stationary in their initial position at the bottom center of the frame. The man holding the celery in his mouth remains still throughout the event. The scene is set outdoors against a dark, blurred background of green foliage, and the playing card is thrown from off-screen, slicing through the celery stalk in slow motion.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The video uses a speed ramp effect, alternating between slow and regular motion. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground as he holds the celery vertically upward by gripping it with his mouth.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with some facial hair is shown from the neck up, looking directly upward. He wears a red baseball cap backward and is holding a long, green celery stalk vertically upward by biting it with his mouth. The celery stalk is then sliced in half by a playing card that is thrown through the air. Partially visible behind this man is another person's hand, which throws the card, and a portion of their head with short brown hair.",

    "Scene": "Set outdoors against a dark, blurred background of green foliage, a long, green celery stalk is balanced vertically on a person's face. The person is wearing a red baseball cap worn backward and looking upward. In slow motion, a playing card is thrown from off-screen, slicing through the celery stalk. The top half of the stalk and the card are seen falling away, while the bottom portion remains momentarily in place.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
