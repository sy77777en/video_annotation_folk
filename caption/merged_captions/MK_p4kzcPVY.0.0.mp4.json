  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a smooth leftward camera movement, revealing a beige wall on the right and a yellow door on the left, framing a central view into a hallway. A person with a light skin tone enters the frame from the right, their back to the camera, wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a longer, patterned tunic with a curved hem in shades of grey, black, and white, along with black leggings. They settle in the center of the frame, establishing a medium shot that captures them from the mid-torso down. As they walk directly away from the camera, moving from the middle ground deeper into the background of the hallway, their arms are held down at their sides. The camera, positioned at hip-level and maintaining a level-angle perspective, smoothly trucks left, revealing a blurry foreground and a slightly clearer part of the door in the middle ground. The scene is captured with warm, ambient lighting, and the walls are painted in shades of beige and yellow. The overall focus is soft, creating a shallow depth of field. As the person recedes, they shift slightly to the center-right and become progressively smaller and more out of focus. In the distant background, visible through a doorway, are a wooden stool and a dark curtain next to a window with blinds. The entire scene ultimately remains out of focus, with the camera maintaining the subject's height throughout the action.",

    "Camera": "This hip-level, level-angle shot begins with a shallow depth of field, leaving the scene out of focus. As a person enters the frame, they briefly come into focus before blurring again as they walk into the background. The camera smoothly trucks left, revealing a blurry foreground and a slightly clearer part of the door in the middle ground, with the entire scene ultimately remaining out of focus.",
    "Subject": "A person with a light skin tone is shown from the back, walking away from the camera. They are wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a longer, patterned tunic with a curved hem. The tunic has an abstract pattern in shades of grey, black, and white. The individual is also wearing black leggings. Their arms are held down at their sides as they walk.",
    "Motion": "A person enters the frame from the right side and is then seen from behind as they walk away from the camera down a hallway, viewed from a level-angle perspective.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle, moving leftward viewpoint, the scene captures an indoor hallway with warm, ambient lighting. The walls are painted in shades of beige and yellow. In the foreground, a soft, out-of-focus surface frames the view. A person, seen from the back, walks away down the hallway. In the background, visible through a doorway, are a wooden stool and a dark curtain next to a window with blinds. The overall focus is soft, creating a shallow depth of field.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
