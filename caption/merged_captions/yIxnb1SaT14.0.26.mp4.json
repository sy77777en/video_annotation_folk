  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of an urban scenery at night, framed from a low angle looking up at the buildings. In the foreground, the curved facade of an illuminated stone building occupies the left side of the frame, highlighted by a warm, yellow light that accentuates its blocky texture, open yellow shutters, and a black, wrought-iron balcony. Positioned in the middle ground are a tall, turreted building in the center-right, appearing mostly in silhouette, and a railway overpass that occupies the bottom right. The deep blue night sky primarily fills the top and right portions of the frame. The video is a time-lapse played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, capturing the passage of time over a long period. Vehicle lights occasionally create streaks of blue lines as they flash past, and the clouds are in motion, adding dynamic elements to the scene. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up from below, with the railway appearing in the bottom-right corner of the frame. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera exhibits minor movement, smoothly and slowly zooming in and rolling clockwise. An overlay of white text is present in the bottom right corner, reading \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" above the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\". The composition emphasizes the majestic and atmospheric quality of the urban environment, using the interplay of light, shadow, and architectural forms to evoke a feeling of nocturnal grandeur.",

    "Camera": "The video is a time-lapse played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, capturing the passage of time over a long period. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up from below, with the railway appearing in the bottom-right corner of the frame. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera exhibits minor movement, zooming in and rolling clockwise, with very smooth and slow motion.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a low angle looking up at grand European architecture against a deep blue night sky. On the left, a curved stone building is warmly illuminated, highlighting its detailed facade, open shutters, and an ornate iron balcony. In the middleground, a taller, turreted structure stands mostly in silhouette, its dark form creating a sense of imposing scale, while a railway on an overpass is also situated in front of it. The deep blue sky serves as the background. There is no single main subject; instead, the composition emphasizes the majestic and atmospheric quality of the urban environment, using the interplay of light, shadow, and architectural forms to evoke a feeling of nocturnal grandeur.",
    "Motion": "This is a low-angle shot of two ornate, European-style buildings against a dark blue night sky. A railway on an overpass is visible in the bottom-right middleground. In the time-lapse, vehicle lights occasionally create streaks of blue lines as they flash past. Only the building in the foreground is illuminated by an unseen warm light source from below, while other structures remain in silhouette. The camera shows minor movement, smoothly and slowly zooming in and rolling clockwise.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, nighttime shot looks up at three ornate buildings against a deep blue sky. On the left, the curved facade of a stone building is illuminated by a warm, yellow light, highlighting its blocky texture. This building features a window with a black, wrought-iron balcony and completely open yellow shutters. In the middle ground, a taller, darker building is visible, topped with a prominent domed turret, appearing mostly in silhouette. In front of it, a railway on an overpass is also in the middle ground. An overlay of white text is present in the bottom right corner, reading \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" above the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of an urban scenery at night, framed from a low angle looking up at the buildings. In the foreground, the curved facade of an illuminated stone building occupies the left side of the frame. Positioned in the middle ground are a tall, turreted building in the center-right and a railway overpass that occupies the bottom right. Vehicle lights transform into streaks of blue lines flashing by, and the clouds are in motion, adding dynamic elements to the scene. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in and rolls clockwise. The deep blue night sky primarily fills the top and right portions of the frame. A text overlay is situated at the bottom right corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
