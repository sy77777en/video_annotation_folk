  "merged_caption": "The scene features a large, dark, silhouetted abstract form that dominates the center of the frame, extending towards the top, left, and right edges. Smaller silhouetted elements are visible: one near the top left and another near the bottom center. The background consists of bright blue light beams radiating outwards from behind the central silhouette, creating a dramatic backlight effect. The video begins with this view, and as the camera steadily moves forward while rolling clockwise, the form becomes more defined, revealing its irregular shape and the presence of protruding elements. The light continues to shine through the form, highlighting its contours and casting shadows that enhance the sense of depth. The camera's movement is smooth and gradual, maintaining the focus on the form while the light remains the primary source of illumination. Throughout the shot, the large central silhouette subtly shifts and rotates, altering its specific shape within the frame while maintaining its prominent position. The lighting suggests a controlled, artificial source, casting long shadows and emphasizing the texture of the silhouetted object. The overall color scheme is dominated by deep blacks and vibrant blues, contributing to a moody and enigmatic ambiance. The video concludes with the camera getting very close to the form, emphasizing its intricate details and the contrast between the dark silhouette and the bright light. In the bottom left corner, there is an overlay of white text reading \"[2],\" which provides additional context or information not directly related to the scene itself. The overall composition suggests a mysterious or otherworldly atmosphere, with the focus on the interplay between the dark silhouette and the luminous background.",

    "Camera": "The camera steadily moves forward while rolling clockwise, with very smooth motion and no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a silhouetted, abstract form that appears to be a large, irregularly shaped object or structure. It is predominantly dark, with a few protruding elements that suggest a complex, possibly mechanical or organic nature. The object is set against a backdrop of bright, diffused blue light, creating a stark contrast that emphasizes its outline. The light radiates outward, adding a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The overall composition suggests a mysterious or otherworldly atmosphere, with the focus on the interplay between the dark silhouette and the luminous background.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a dark, abstract form illuminated by a bright, radiant light source from behind, creating a dramatic backlight effect.

    "Scene": "The video opens with a view of a dark, abstract form illuminated by a bright, radiant light source from behind, creating a dramatic backlight effect. The setting features a silhouette of an indistinct object or structure, possibly draped fabric or a large piece of equipment, set against a backdrop of intense, blue-tinted light beams. These beams create a striking contrast, highlighting the silhouette's edges and adding depth to the scene. The lighting suggests a controlled, artificial source, casting long shadows and emphasizing the texture of the silhouetted object. The overall color scheme is dominated by deep blacks and vibrant blues, contributing to a moody and enigmatic ambiance. In the bottom left corner, there is an overlay of white text reading \"[2],\" which provides additional context or information not directly related to the scene itself.",
    "Spatial": "The scene features a large, dark, silhouetted abstract form that dominates the center of the frame, extending towards the top, left, and right edges.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
