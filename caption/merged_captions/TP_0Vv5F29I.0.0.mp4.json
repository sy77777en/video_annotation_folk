  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a long freight train is centered in the middle ground, moving forward at a consistent speed along a single track that divides the frame vertically through a vast, flat landscape of plowed brown fields. Vast, plowed fields extend from the foreground to the background on both the left and right sides, while a line of trees, buildings, and low hills sits on the horizon in the distant background under a clear blue sky. The black locomotive at the front features a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo and pulls a series of flatbed cars carrying a custom-built course constructed from dark blue shipping containers, all displaying Red Bull logos, and a series of connected white and blue ramps. A man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and red pants sits on a black mountain bike atop a tall blue structure on the first cargo car, just behind the locomotive. On-screen text identifies him as \"DAWID MTB ATHLETE\" and states the objective: \"I'm going to ride on a moving train attempting one single run from start to finish.\" As the train approaches, the aerial, high-angle drone camera smoothly moves downward and arcs counterclockwise around the cyclist, transitioning the view to a wide shot of the cyclist. This brings the locomotive into the bottom left of the frame and the cyclist, positioned on a high platform on a cargo car, to the top left. The ramp course extends from the center of the frame towards the right. As it descends to an overhead, level-angle perspective, the camera pans left to track the cyclist, causing him to become larger in the frame. The shot is very smooth and maintains a deep focus throughout.",

    "Camera": "This aerial, high-angle shot begins by looking down at an approaching train. A drone camera smoothly moves downward and arcs counterclockwise around the cyclist on top of a train carriage. As it descends to an overhead, level-angle perspective, the camera pans left to track the cyclist, causing him to become larger in the frame. The shot is very smooth and maintains a deep focus throughout.",
    "Subject": "A long freight train with a dark blue locomotive travels along a single track. The front of the locomotive is adorned with a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo, and its side displays the text \"GRUPA AZOTY\" and \"KOLTAR.\" The train's cargo consists of blue shipping containers and flatbed cars, which have been modified to form a continuous course of white ramps and platforms. At the beginning of this course, a man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and red pants sits on a black mountain bike. He is positioned atop a tall blue structure on the first cargo car, just behind the locomotive. On-screen text identifies him as \"DAWID MTB ATHLETE.\" Several of the blue containers along the train also feature the \"Red Bull\" logo.",
    "Motion": "An aerial camera follows a long freight train as it travels forward at a consistent speed along a single track through a rural landscape. A man seated on a black mountain bike atop the first cargo car takes a sip from a cup as the train moves through the countryside.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a long freight train moving along a single, straight track that cuts through a vast, flat landscape of plowed brown fields. The scene takes place during the day under a clear blue sky. The black locomotive at the front features a Red Bull logo and pulls a series of flatbed cars carrying a custom-built course. This course is constructed from dark blue shipping containers, all displaying Red Bull logos, and a series of connected white and blue ramps. A person on a bicycle is visible at the start of the course, positioned on a high platform above a container. In the distance, a faint line of trees, buildings, and low hills marks the horizon. White text overlays appear on screen, identifying the rider as \"DAWID MTB ATHLETE\" and stating the objective: \"I'm going to ride on a moving train attempting one single run from start to finish.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a long train is centered in the middle ground, moving forward along a single track that divides the frame vertically. Vast, plowed fields extend from the foreground to the background on both the left and right sides, while a line of trees and buildings sits on the horizon in the distant background. As the train approaches, the camera arcs and descends, transitioning the view to a wide shot of the cyclist. This brings the locomotive into the bottom left of the frame and the cyclist, positioned on a high platform on a cargo car, to the top left. The ramp course extends from the center of the frame towards the right. The camera's perspective, initially high above the train, lowers to a position at the cyclist's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
