  "merged_caption": "The video captures an urban street scene with a wide shot, focusing on a portion of the sidewalk and surrounding buildings. Initially, an individual in dark clothing and a hooded jacket appears slightly to the right of center, walking away from the camera. This person holds an umbrella and moves steadily forward, eventually shifting to slightly left of center, remaining in the middle ground. As the video progresses, two additional individuals enter from the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground, walking side by side and each carrying a coffee. These three figures maintain their respective positions throughout the video, with the initial individual slightly ahead. The left half of the frame is lined with buildings, including a McDonald's identifiable by its yellow 'M' logo and large windows, and further down, \"Miller's Pub\" marked by a prominent red neon sign with white lettering. A small portion of the sky is visible above, while the right side features a staircase resembling a pedestrian overpass and buildings in the distance. Illuminated signs, such as a fast-food logo slightly to the left of center in the middle ground and a pub sign further back in the center, are visible. Streetlights cast a warm glow, reflecting off the wet pavement at the bottom of the frame. Pigeons are scattered across the middle ground. The camera features a forward-moving perspective at eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus, capturing a large depth of field. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, as it progresses down the street, focusing on the urban environment and pedestrians. The overall scene is dimly lit, with artificial lights piercing the haze, creating a dynamic flow along the urban street.",

    "Camera": "The video features a forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus, capturing a large depth of field. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, as it progresses down the street, focusing on the urban environment and pedestrians.",
    "Subject": "The video depicts a dimly lit urban street scene with three distinct individuals. One person, holding an umbrella, walks ahead, while the other two walk side by side behind, each carrying a bag on their back and holding a paper bag in their left hand. The person on the left is adjusting their hair with their right hand, and the person on the right is holding a cup of coffee in their right hand. All three individuals are dressed in dark-colored clothing. The street is lined with buildings featuring illuminated signs, including a recognizable fast-food logo and a pub sign. A few pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a typical city street with pedestrians and ambient lighting.",
    "Motion": "On a dimly lit, wet street, a man holding an umbrella walks forward, passing by a McDonald's in the midground. As he continues walking, two other individuals appear from the left side of the frame, both holding paper cups, and follow him. The street is lined with buildings, and the scene is illuminated by streetlights and the glow from nearby signs.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a walk along a wet city sidewalk during foggy or misty conditions with a somewhat dark and overcast sky, making it difficult to determine the exact time. Multi-story buildings line the left side, including a McDonald's identifiable by its yellow 'M' logo and large windows, and further down, \"Miller's Pub\" marked by a prominent red neon sign with white lettering. The concrete sidewalk reflects the warm yellow glow from streetlights and storefronts. To the right, a large, dark, elevated structure casts a shadow over the walkway, and an overpass with staircases for pedestrians is visible on the sidewalk. Two rows of parked vehicles line the sides of the street. Several pedestrians in dark clothing move along the sidewalk, and pigeons are visible on the wet ground. The overall scene is dimly lit, with artificial lights piercing the haze.",

The camera remains at eye level relative to the subjects, providing a consistent perspective of the scene. The spatial arrangement and movement of the subjects create a dynamic flow along the urban street."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
