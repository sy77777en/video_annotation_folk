  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a man with long, dark hair, wearing a red, short-sleeved shirt with a yellow pineapple print over striped pants, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To his left, the arm and torso of a partially visible man with dark skin, wearing a red t-shirt, are visible in the foreground. The red interior of a sports car occupies the foreground and middle ground, while a canopy densely covered with small, warm, glowing lights fills the background at the top of the frame, creating a bright, blurred backdrop. The entire scene is warped by significant visual distortion, characterized by chromatic aberration at the edges. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise, rising from hip level to eye level, maintaining a shallow focus to keep the man in the red pineapple shirt sharp. As the scene unfolds at night, the man in the red pineapple shirt rises from a seated position, exits the sports car, and turns away from the camera. The warm tones of red and yellow dominate the scene, enhanced by the distorted lens effect. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamic motion and the unique visual composition of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly arcs clockwise, rising from hip level to eye level. It maintains a shallow focus, keeping the person in the red pineapple shirt in the middle ground sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man with long, dark hair is standing out from a car, wearing a red, short-sleeved shirt with a yellow pineapple print over striped pants. To his left, a partially visible man with dark skin, wearing a red t-shirt, is also present.",
    "Motion": "A person in a red, pineapple-print shirt rises from a seated position, exits a sports car, and turns away from the camera.",
    "Scene": "A nighttime scene unfolds with a Black man exiting a sports car, characterized by significant visual distortion that warps the entire view. The middle ground features a wavy, white molded seat inside the red car. Overhead, a canopy is densely covered with small, warm, glowing lights, creating a bright, blurred background. The scene is filled with warm tones of red and yellow, and the distorted lens effect creates chromatic aberration at the edges.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a person in a red pineapple shirt is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To their left, the arm and torso of another person are visible in the foreground. The red interior of a car occupies the foreground and middle ground, while a canopy of bright lights fills the background at the top of the frame. The entire scene is warped by a significant visual distortion. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
