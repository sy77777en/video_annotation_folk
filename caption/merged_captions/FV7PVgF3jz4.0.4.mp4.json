  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from behind two audience members in the right foreground, with the left side of the frame obscured. The camera moves smoothly to the right, revealing a full view of a stage in the middle ground, framed by a red curtain in the background. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks from the left side of the stage to the center middle ground, stopping behind a small, cloth-covered table. The camera continues to truck right as the man walks to the center of the middle ground, illuminated by a circular spotlight, while the backs and clapping hands of the audience are visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. As the audience begins to applaud, he picks up a golden, stylized statuette with an abstract design from the table. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the audience in the foreground and the man on stage sharp and clear. Camera flashes from the audience direction occur periodically, shifting the scene's color from warm tones to a cool blue. After a moment, the man smiles slightly before turning and walking off-screen to the right with his award.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, eye-level perspective, the camera moves smoothly to the right, revealing a man on a stage accepting an award. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the audience in the foreground and the man on stage sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "Several people are seen from behind, seated in red theater chairs and facing a stage. One man has short, graying hair and wears a dark suit jacket. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He stands behind a small table and, as the audience members, whose hands are briefly visible, begin to applaud, he picks up a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design that is already on the table. The young man smiles slightly before walking away with his award.",
    "Motion": "A young man with curly hair walks from the left side of the frame, in front of a red curtain, onto a stage and stands behind a small table. As the audience begins to applaud, he picks up a golden statuette from the table. He holds the award and smiles slightly before turning and walking off the stage with it.",
    "Scene": "From an audience perspective, the scene unfolds in a dark theater looking towards a small stage framed by heavy, red velvet curtains. A circular spotlight illuminates a man in a black turtleneck and jacket who walks to a small, cloth-covered table. On the table rests a golden, stylized statuette, which he picks up as audience members in the foreground clap from their red, upholstered seats. Camera flashes from the audience direction occur periodically, shifting the scene's color from warm tones to a cool blue.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium shot from behind two audience members in the right foreground, with the left side of the frame obscured. The camera trucks to the right, revealing a full view of a stage in the middle ground, framed by a red curtain in the background. A man, shown from the upper torso up, walks from the left side of the stage to the center middle ground, stopping behind a small table. The camera continues to truck right as the man walks to the center of the middle ground, illuminated by a circular spotlight, while the backs and clapping hands of the audience are visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. After a moment, the man picks up a statuette from the table and walks off-screen to the right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
