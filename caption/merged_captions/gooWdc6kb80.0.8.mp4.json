  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, with the camera at the subject's height, capturing a man with dark hair, a mustache, and black-rimmed glasses, wearing a grey patterned t-shirt. He is positioned in the center middle ground, holding a silver pocket watch on a chain forward. A wooden table occupies the bottom foreground, while six lit incandescent lightbulbs hang from black cords at the top of the frame in the foreground, with three on the left and three on the right against a solid black background. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the man and the hanging lightbulbs sharp and in focus. The man releases the watch and moves out of the frame to the right. As the watch falls toward the center of the table, the text \"macro room\" appears as an overlay in the center, with \"macro\" in white and \"room\" in teal, and remains visible. The camera remains static, positioned at a height between the falling watch and the hanging bulbs. In a slow-motion sequence, the watch hits the table and bounces back up in the bottom-center of the foreground. Simultaneously, the six lightbulbs at the top of the frame explode in a sequence of bright flashes, shattering and sending shards of glass and puffs of smoke outwards. The watch, featuring a white face and black hands, lands back on the table as the debris settles around it, with the text remaining stationary in the center. Throughout the event, the camera maintains a level angle, capturing the dynamic motion of the watch and the dramatic explosion of the lightbulbs in a coherent and visually striking composition.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the man holding the stopwatch in the middle ground and the hanging lightbulbs in the foreground sharp and in focus.",
    "Subject": "A man with dark hair, a mustache, and black-rimmed glasses, wearing a grey patterned t-shirt, holds a silver pocket watch on a chain. After he releases the watch and moves away, the words \"macro room\" appear, with \"macro\" in white and \"room\" in teal. The silver pocket watch, featuring a white face and black hands, is shown in a slow-motion shot where it falls onto the table and bounces back up. Above it, several incandescent lightbulbs hanging from black cords simultaneously explode, shattering into pieces with flashes of light and puffs of smoke.",
    "Motion": "A man holds a pocket watch on a chain and then releases it, letting it fall toward a wooden table as he moves out of the frame. In a slow-motion sequence, the watch hits the table and bounces back up. Simultaneously, several lightbulbs hanging from cords above the table explode, shattering and sending glass fragments and smoke outwards. The watch lands back on the table as the debris settles around it.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting against a solid black background, a wooden surface occupies the foreground. A man with glasses and a patterned shirt holds a swinging silver pocket watch and a film clapperboard before moving out of view. Several lit incandescent light bulbs hang from black cords above the table. The bulbs then explode in a sequence of bright flashes, sending shards of glass and puffs of smoke into the air. Throughout the event, the silver pocket watch slowly falls onto the table and bounces back up in the foreground. A text overlay appears, reading \"macro\" in white and \"room\" in a teal color.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, with the camera at the subject's height. A man is positioned in the center middle ground, holding a pocket watch forward. A wooden table occupies the bottom foreground, while six lit lightbulbs hang from the top of the frame in the foreground, with three on the left and three on the right against a black background. The man releases the watch and moves out of the frame to the right. As the watch falls toward the center of the table, the text \"macro room\" appears as an overlay in the center and remains visible. The camera is now positioned at a height between the falling watch and the hanging bulbs. The six lightbulbs at the top of the frame then explode simultaneously, while the pocket watch lands and bounces in the bottom-center of the foreground, with the text remaining stationary in the center."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
