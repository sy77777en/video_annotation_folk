  "merged_caption": "This wide shot opens on a rural landscape with a large, round, golden hay bale made of straw resting in the right foreground of a harvested field covered in dry stubble. In the left middle ground, a white camper van with a raised roof section is initially positioned next to a tall, leafy green tree. The van drives horizontally from left to right along a road that borders the field, passing the tree before eventually disappearing from view as it exits the frame on the right. As the shot progresses, the camera, using a deep focus to keep the entire rural landscape sharp, begins at a level angle, eye-level height and then smoothly pedestals upward. This transition reveals a line of dark green hedges and distant fields stretching across the horizon, with a faint view of a body of water in the far background, while maintaining the view of the harvested field, the hay bale in the foreground, and the distant tree line. The partly cloudy sky forms the backdrop to this serene rural scene.",

    "Camera": "This shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire rural landscape, from the hay bale in the foreground to the camper van in the mid-ground, sharp. The camera begins at a level angle, eye-level height and then smoothly pedestals upward, transitioning to an overhead view of the scene.",
    "Subject": "In the foreground of a harvested field, a large, cylindrical hay bale made of golden straw rests on the right side. In the midground, a white camper van with a raised roof section is already in motion, driving from the left past a tall, leafy green tree, and continues to move from left to right along a road, eventually moving completely out of the scene on the right.",
    "Motion": "A white camper van travels from left to right along a road in the midground, passing a large tree before driving completely out of the frame on the right. A large, round hay bale in the foreground remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "In a rural landscape under a partly cloudy sky, a large, round, golden hay bale rests in the foreground of a harvested field covered in dry stubble. In the mid-ground, a white campervan drives from left to right along a road that borders the field, passing a lone, leafy green tree. As the camera ascends, a line of dark green hedges and distant fields becomes visible, stretching across the horizon with a faint view of a body of water in the far background.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot opens on a rural landscape with a large, round hay bale in the right foreground. In the left middle ground, a white camper van is initially positioned next to a tree. The van drives horizontally from left to right along a road in the middle ground, eventually disappearing from view as it exits the frame on the right. As the shot progresses, the camera gradually ascends, revealing a large body of water in the distant background while maintaining the view of the harvested field, the hay bale in the foreground, and the distant tree line."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
