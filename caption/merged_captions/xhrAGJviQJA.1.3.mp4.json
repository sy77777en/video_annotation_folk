  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and initially silhouetted by a bright opening of the cave in the middle ground. He is shirtless, has a muscular build, and is equipped for freediving or snorkeling, wearing a mask over his face and a snorkel tube extending upwards. A watch is visible on his left wrist. As he moves slowly forward, deeper into the dark underwater cave, the opening shifts to the background and appears smaller, while he remains centered in the frame. The dark, rough walls of the cave occupy the foreground and middle ground, extending into the background as the man progresses further. The camera is positioned at the man's level, maintaining a view from the front as it moves backward, leading him out of the cave. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the person and the surrounding cave walls sharp. Sunlight streams down through the water from the bright opening, where the water is a brilliant blue. The man holds a long pole, likely a selfie stick, with both hands, pointing it towards the camera. A pole extends from the man in the center towards the camera in the foreground, occupying the bottom center of the frame. Both fins alternately appear behind his head as he swims steadily away from the bright opening that leads to the water's surface. The rough, dark rock walls of the cave create a silhouette around the bright opening behind. The camera's perspective remains level with him, maintaining a smooth, underwater shot as he progresses further into the cave.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, underwater shot from a level angle. The camera moves backward, leading a person who is swimming forward out of a cave. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the person and the surrounding cave walls sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man is seen from a level-angle perspective while underwater, silhouetted against a bright opening to the surface from within a dark, narrow space that appears to be a cave. He is shirtless and has a muscular build. He is equipped for freediving or snorkeling, wearing a mask over his face and a snorkel tube extending upwards. Both fins alternately appear behind his head. He holds a long pole, likely a selfie stick, with both hands, pointing it towards the camera. A watch is visible on his left wrist.",
    "Motion": "A man, holding a camera on a pole, swims slowly forward inside a dark underwater cave, moving steadily away from the bright opening that leads to the water's surface. The camera's perspective remains level with him, maintaining a view from the front as he progresses.",
    "Scene": "The camera is positioned in front of a person inside a dark, underwater cave, looking towards them. The rough, dark rock walls of the cave create a silhouette around the bright opening behind, where the water is a brilliant blue. Sunlight streams down through the water from this opening. The person, holding the camera on a pole, is also in silhouette as they move further into the cave. Two swim fins alternately appear behind their head.",
    "Spatial": "In this wide shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and initially silhouetted by a bright opening of the cave in the middle ground. As he moves forward, deeper into the cave, the opening shifts to the background and appears smaller, while he remains centered in the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
