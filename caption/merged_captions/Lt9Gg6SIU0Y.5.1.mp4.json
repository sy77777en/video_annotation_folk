  "merged_caption": "The video showcases numerous small, glowing blue dots distributed throughout a dark space, forming a three-dimensional grid. Initially, the dots are arranged along straight lines that extend from the left side of the scene toward a central vanishing point near the center-right, creating a tunnel-like effect. The dots fill the entire view, with higher density toward the center and sparser distribution at the edges, enhancing the sense of depth. As the perspective shifts, the lines of dots radiate symmetrically from the center outward in all directions, intensifying the starburst effect. The dots remain distributed across all depths, but the central convergence point is now at the center, with lines extending toward the top, bottom, left, and right edges. The small blue dots move steadily along straight lines that converge toward a central point, creating the appearance of traveling through a tunnel or toward the vanishing point. As the motion continues, the dots maintain their paths, with some dots appearing to approach the viewer while others recede, enhancing the sense of depth and perspective throughout the video. The camera appears to be positioned within the same plane as the dots, at the level of the grid, and the transition involves a shift in the camera’s orientation, moving from an angled view toward the vanishing point to a direct, head-on view of the central convergence. The video features artificially generated moving light dots, making it challenging to discern camera motion. However, if the camera is moving, the movement is exceptionally smooth and free of any shaking. The overall composition is abstract, with no recognizable people, animals, or objects, and the visual focus is on the geometric arrangement and luminous quality of the blue dots as they form dynamic, radiating structures.",

    "Subject": "The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming intricate patterns that suggest depth and perspective. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, with some appearing more prominent than others, and are distributed along lines that converge toward a central vanishing point, creating a tunnel-like or starburst effect. The overall composition is abstract, with no recognizable people, animals, or objects, and the visual focus is on the geometric arrangement and luminous quality of the blue dots as they form dynamic, radiating structures.",

As the motion continues, the dots maintain their paths, with some dots appearing to approach the viewer while others recede, enhancing the sense of depth and perspective throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an abstract, indoor environment filled with countless small, glowing blue dots arranged in a three-dimensional grid pattern. These dots appear suspended in a dark space, creating a tunnel-like effect with lines of light converging toward a central vanishing point. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, and their arrangement forms geometric shapes and radiating lines, giving the scene a sense of depth and motion. The overall color scheme is dominated by shades of blue and black, with the glowing dots providing the primary illumination against the dark background. The visual elements are smooth and uniform, with no visible texture or markings beyond the luminous quality of the dots. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its abstract, digital appearance without any discernible natural or architectural features.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
