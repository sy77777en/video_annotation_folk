  "merged_caption": "This medium full shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the back of a person's head and left shoulder occupying the foreground on the right side of the screen. The person has dark hair tied back in a ponytail and wears a dark blue top. In the middle ground, an elderly man with long white hair in a topknot and a long, full white beard stands in the center of the frame, wearing a long, dark gray, open-front robe over white undergarments, with a black sash at his waist. He stands with a stern expression, his hands held behind his back. To his left stands a younger man with black hair, a mustache, and a goatee, wearing a dark blue robe with light gray sleeves and a white yin-yang symbol on the chest. The two men are situated near the exit of a dimly lit, traditional East Asian hall filled with dark, intricately carved wooden latticework screens and partitions that extend from the middle ground into the background. Small, decorative lanterns and pagoda-like structures are visible amongst the wooden framework, with hints of red and gold in the deep background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level, focusing on the two men in the midground from a slightly unsteady, low, eye-level angle. The use of a shallow depth of field keeps the person in the foreground out of focus. The elderly man in the center appears to shift slightly, as if taking a step back and lifting his head a little, while the younger man to his side and the person in the foreground remain stationary throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The view looks into a dimly lit, traditional East Asian hall filled with dark, intricately carved wooden latticework screens and partitions. In the midground, two men stand. The central figure is an older man with long white hair and a beard, dressed in a grey and white layered robe. To his side stands another man in a dark blue robe featuring a circular symbol on the chest and a flat-topped hat. Small, decorative lanterns and pagoda-like structures are visible amongst the wooden framework, with hints of red and gold in the deep background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
