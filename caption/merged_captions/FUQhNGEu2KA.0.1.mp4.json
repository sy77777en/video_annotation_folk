  "merged_caption": "This full shot is framed with a lit lamp on a nightstand in the left middle ground, while a bed occupies approximately 70% of the frame's width from the center-left to the right, also in the middle ground. A person, initially seen in the center middle ground, moves toward the center-right and gets into the bed. The person is wearing a light-colored, loose-fitting shirt and climbs into a bed with light green sheets and a matching pillow. As they lie down, they pull a patterned, dark green blanket over their body until they are nearly completely covered, with only some of their black hair visible outside of the blanket. Their form becomes obscured under the covers in the center-right of the frame. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level as they are bent over, and as they lie down, the fixed camera angle becomes positioned above them. Filmed from a level angle, eye-level perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera executes a very slow and smooth forward movement. In a dimly lit room, the only source of light is a lamp with a bronze-colored base and a white, trapezoidal shade, which sits on a dark nightstand featuring a greenish-blue top. To the left, a lit lamp with a white, trapezoidal shade and a bronze-colored, curved base sits on a dark nightstand with a greenish-blue top, casting a focused pool of light onto the wall behind it. A small, dark, cylindrical object is visible to the right of the lamp on the nightstand. The lamp illuminates a bed with a light green sheet and a pillow, leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.",

    "Scene": "In a dark bedroom at night, the only source of light is a lamp with a bronze-colored base and a white, trapezoidal shade, which sits on a dark nightstand featuring a greenish-blue top. Next to the lamp is a small, black, cylindrical object. The lamp illuminates a bed with a light green sheet and a pillow. A person wearing light-colored clothing gets into the bed and pulls a patterned blanket over themselves, leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
