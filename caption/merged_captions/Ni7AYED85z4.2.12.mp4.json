  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a light-skinned man and a light-skinned woman in the left foreground, walking toward the camera along a wet, stone-paved walkway in Venice on an overcast day. The man, with short, light brown hair, a short beard, and black sunglasses, wears a brown collared jacket, black pants, and light-colored sneakers with pink accents. The woman beside him has long, dark brown hair, a black jacket, and black pants, with her arms crossed and a black bag over her shoulder. They walk side-by-side along the path next to a body of choppy, grey-green water, moving toward the camera and then continuing past it, exiting the frame on the left. The scene features a weathered, light-colored building on the right side of the frame, with windows protected by black, ornate metal grilles. A black lamppost stands on the path, and in the misty distance, a small boat is docked at a pier. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing a static, slightly unsteady shot from an eye-level, level angle. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. As the couple walks forward and exits the frame on the left, the video leaves a static shot of the empty walkway, the building on the right, and the water on the left.",

    "Scene": "A scene in Venice on an overcast day shows a wet, stone-paved walkway alongside a body of choppy, grey-green water. To the right, a weathered, light-colored building features windows protected by black, ornate metal grilles. A black lamppost stands on the path, and in the misty distance, a small boat is docked at a pier. A man and a woman walk along the walkway and out of the frame, leaving the scene empty.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a man and a woman in the left foreground, walking toward the camera along a stone walkway that extends from the foreground into the background. A building occupies the right side of the frame, while a body of water is visible to the left in the middle ground, where a lamppost also stands. In the background, a docked boat is visible. The couple walks forward and exits the frame on the left, leaving a static shot of the empty walkway, the building on the right, and the water on the left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
