  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot of the cityscape, showcasing a panoramic view of numerous high-rise buildings. These buildings are arranged across the frame, with some in the foreground and others extending into the background, creating a sense of depth. The camera is at an aerial level, moving forward smoothly with minimal shaking, while also descending slightly. It maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, and uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The scene features a collection of high-rise buildings with a mix of modern and classic architectural styles, primarily composed of glass and concrete, with reflective surfaces that catch the sunlight. The sky is clear, adding a bright backdrop to the scene. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, focusing on a specific building with a glass facade. This building is centrally positioned in the frame, with the glass panel that shatters located in the center middle ground. The camera maintains a level height relative to the building, highlighting the dramatic effect of the shattering glass against the city backdrop. The video captures the essence of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the varied architectural designs of towering skyscrapers, and emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the geometric patterns of the windows and the grid-like arrangement of the structures. Notably, one building's glass facade shows evidence of an explosion of one of its glass panels, creating a contrast with the otherwise smooth surfaces. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or activity, emphasizing the static nature of the urban environment.",

    "Subject": "The video opens with a dramatic cityscape scene, focusing on a multi-story building with striking glass facades. As the camera approaches, one of the glass panels unexpectedly shatters, adding a surprising and dramatic element to the urban environment. The video captures the essence of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the varied architectural designs of towering skyscrapers, and emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video features a cityscape with tall buildings and a rooftop view. There is a moment where a glass window shatters, creating a dramatic effect.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an urban cityscape during the day. The scene features a collection of high-rise buildings with a mix of modern and classic architectural styles.

    "Spatial": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot of the cityscape, showcasing a panoramic view of numerous high-rise buildings. These buildings are arranged across the frame, with some in the foreground and others extending into the background, creating a sense of depth. The camera angle is level, likely captured from a drone, offering a comprehensive view of the urban environment. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, focusing on a specific building with a glass facade. This building is centrally positioned in the frame, with the glass panel that shatters located in the center middle ground. The camera maintains a level height relative to the building, highlighting the dramatic effect of the shattering glass against the city backdrop."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
