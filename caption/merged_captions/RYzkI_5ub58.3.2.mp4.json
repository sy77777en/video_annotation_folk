  "merged_caption": "A hyena is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame and situated in the middle ground. The spotted hyena, with light brown to reddish-brown fur that appears slightly damp on its head, stands mostly still in the tall grass, a vibrant mix of yellow and green hues, under bright daylight. It has prominent, rounded ears that are dark on the inside and a dark snout. Thin blades of grass in the foreground partially obscure the lower portion of the hyena's body and chest. The animal is surrounded by more grass in the middle ground, which extends into a softly blurred background. The camera remains static at the hyena's level throughout the shot, using an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the hyena in the midground while blurring the tall grass in the foreground and background. The shot is slightly unsteady, and the hyena's right ear slowly moves from the side of its head to facing forward. With slight movements of its head, it blinks, the ear moves slightly, and its mouth opens slightly. The hyena is facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, with some blades of grass partially obscuring its lower body and chest.",

    "Scene": "A hyena with coarse, orange-brown fur stands in a field of tall grass, a mix of bright yellow and vibrant green, under bright daylight. The animal has dark, rounded ears and a dark snout. Thin blades of grass in the foreground partially obscure the hyena's abdomen and part of its body. The background is a softly blurred expanse of the same sunlit, mixed-color grassland.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
