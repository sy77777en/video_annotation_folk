  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, featuring a silhouetted man positioned in the center-middle ground of a dimly lit room. In front of him, a large, dark tapestry with a prominent peacock design in black and yellow is visible in the center background. Cabinets and a partially obscured piece of furniture, possibly a sofa or bed draped with light-colored fabric, are situated in the background, while a window with curtains in the right background allows faint, hazy light into the scene. The camera is positioned at hip level, initially level, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the background. The silhouetted man, wearing a dark coat and glasses, appears to be taking a photograph with a flash. As the scene progresses, the camera moves slowly and smoothly forward towards the man, transitioning to a medium close-up as he becomes more prominent in the center-foreground. During this movement, the camera tilts up to a low angle and performs a rack focus to bring the man into focus. The man turns to face the camera while holding his own camera, and the outline of his glasses becomes visible against his head. Subsequently, he slowly turns his head to his left. The camera then tilts upward and pans to the right, maintaining the subject's level throughout.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at hip level. Initially, the camera angle is level, but as it moves, it tilts up to a low angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, starting with the background in focus. It then performs a rack focus to bring the man in the foreground into focus. The camera moves slowly and smoothly forward towards a man in a dark room. When the man turns to face the camera, it tilts upward and then pans to the right.",
    "Subject": "A bald man, seen in silhouette from the back, stands in a dimly lit room wearing a dark coat. A brief flash of light illuminates a tapestry with a peacock design on the wall behind him. As the viewpoint moves closer, the man remains in silhouette, and the outline of his glasses becomes visible against his head. He appears to be adjusting a camera he is holding in front of him.",
    "Motion": "The silhouetted man initially appears to be taking a photograph with a flash in the dimly lit room. He then turns to face the camera while holding his own camera. Subsequently, he slowly turns his head to his left.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a dimly lit interior room, viewed from an objective perspective. A large, dark tapestry with a prominent peacock design in black and yellow hangs on the back wall. In the center at the bottom, a piece of furniture, possibly a sofa or bed, is draped with light-colored fabric. Dark wooden cabinets are visible on both sides of the room. A window with curtains allows a faint, hazy light to enter the room. A silhouetted figure of a bald man wearing a coat and glasses is initially seen from the back, standing in the center of the room. As the scene progresses, the figure moves closer to the camera, remaining in silhouette.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
