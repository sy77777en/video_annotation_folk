  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young, light-skinned man with short, curly brown hair and light stubble in profile, positioned more centrally in the foreground. He wears a black, long-sleeved shirt and looks straight and slightly down with a pensive expression. The left side of his face is illuminated by a soft, warm light, while the rest of his form is cast in shadow. Behind him, a dark, sloping, and out-of-focus landscape occupies the background, consisting of a rocky or sandy terrain with a muted, earthy color palette of browns and grays. The scene is set in a dimly lit outdoor environment. The man remains stationary throughout the clip, holding a fixed pose as he looks straight ahead and slightly downward. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around him, revealing more of his facial features as his profile shifts slightly more toward the center. The camera movement adds a gentle dynamic to the scene, and the shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the man in the foreground. The wind causes the front of his hair to move slightly, enhancing the subtle motion within the frame.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the man in the foreground. The camera performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around him.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, curly brown hair and light stubble is shown in profile. He wears a black, long-sleeved shirt and looks straight and slightly down with a pensive expression. The left side of his face is illuminated, while the rest of his form is cast in shadow.",
    "Motion": "The man remains stationary throughout the clip, holding a fixed pose as he looks straight ahead and slightly downward. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc around him, and the wind causes the front of his hair to move slightly.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit outdoor setting, a young man is seen in profile against a dark, sloping, and barren landscape. The scene is cast in deep shadow, with a soft, warm light illuminating the side of his face and hair. He is wearing a black shirt, which blends into the surrounding darkness. The background consists of an out-of-focus, rocky or sandy terrain with a muted, earthy color palette of browns and grays. The camera moves with a subtle counterclockwise arc, adding a gentle dynamic to the scene.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot frames a man in profile, positioned more centrally in the foreground. Behind him, a dark, sloping, and out-of-focus landscape occupies the background. The camera slowly and subtly arcs counterclockwise around the man, revealing more of his facial features as his profile shifts slightly more toward the center.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
