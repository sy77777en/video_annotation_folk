  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a woman and a man outdoors at night, with the man positioned on the right and the woman on the left in the foreground. Both subjects are positioned close to each other, suggesting a dynamic conversation or interaction. The background consists of dark foliage, creating a serene and calm atmosphere. The scene is dimly lit, with a soft light source highlighting the subjects' faces against the shadowy surroundings. This lighting technique adds depth to the scene, drawing the viewer's attention to the subjects' expressions. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes their facial expressions and interactions. The camera is at eye level with a low angle, looking up at the subjects, and employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man and woman in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly backward, leading the subjects from the front. In this dark outdoor setting, the woman, wearing a colorful scarf, frequently turns her head to look at the man and appears to be speaking to him. The man, dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt, also turns his head occasionally, but not consistently looking at the woman. The background is dark with some foliage visible, and a building with a slanted roof is faintly visible in the distance. The woman has short, dark curly hair and is wearing a dark outfit with a colorful scarf. She frequently turns her head to look around or engage in conversation with the man. The man has short, curly dark hair and is dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He occasionally turns his head during the interaction, not consistently looking at the woman.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
