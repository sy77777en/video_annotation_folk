  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot where a white egret with a long neck, slender body, and a distinct yellow beak is positioned slightly right of center in the frame, standing in the shallow water in the middle ground. The water occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, reflecting the egret and the bank. An eroded bank composed of dark soil runs horizontally across the middle of the frame, situated in the background, and is topped with tall, dry, greenish-brown grasses. The egret remains relatively positioned in the frame but is wading towards the left of the frame. The camera is positioned above water, looking straight ahead with a level angle, using deep focus to maintain clarity across the scene. It pans slowly from right to left, focusing on the egret near the water's edge. The movement is smooth and steady. The egret's legs are partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. Its posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings. The egret begins to move slowly towards the left side of the frame, maintaining a steady pace. The background consists of a grassy bank with some vegetation, and the water reflects the surrounding environment. The egret's movement is consistent and deliberate, suggesting it is either searching for food or patrolling its territory. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The still water reflects the bird and the overhanging bank, capturing an outdoor daytime scene along the bank of a calm body of water.",

    "Subject": "The video features a white egret with a long neck and slender body, standing near the edge of a water body. Its plumage is smooth and bright, and it has a distinct yellow beak. The egret is positioned close to the water, with its legs partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a white egret standing near the edge of a water body, with its legs partially submerged in the water. The egret begins to move slowly towards the left side of the frame, maintaining a steady pace. The background consists of a grassy bank with some vegetation, and the water reflects the surrounding environment. The egret's movement is consistent and deliberate, suggesting it is either searching for food or patrolling its territory.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor daytime scene along the bank of a calm body of water. An eroded bank, composed of dark soil, rises steeply from the water's edge and is topped with tall, dry, greenish-brown grasses. A large white bird with a long neck, slender legs, and a yellow beak stands in the shallow water close to the muddy bank. The still water reflects the bird and the overhanging bank.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot where a white egret is positioned slightly right of center in the frame, standing in the shallow water in the middle ground. The water occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, reflecting the egret and the bank. An eroded bank runs horizontally across the middle of the frame, situated in the background. Tall grasses cover the top portion of the frame along the bank in the background. The egret remains relatively positioned in the frame but is wading towards the left of the frame. The camera is positioned at the egret's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
