  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a serval with a tawny, black-spotted, and striped coat, featuring exceptionally large, rounded ears with distinct black and white patches on the back. The camera is positioned at the animal's level, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the serval in the midground. The serval is located in the middle ground, surrounded by dense thicket of tall, dry, yellowish-brown grass and green, leafy bushes that fill the foreground, middle ground, and background. Initially visible with its head at the left of the frame, the serval consistently walks from left to right through the tall, dense grass, its body partially obscured by the vegetation. The unsteady camera pans right to track the animal as it moves, pausing briefly around the two-second mark when the serval stops momentarily and looks up. The pan then continues, tilting up slightly to keep the serval's head centered in the frame as it begins to move slightly away from the camera's direction. As it moves, its head ends up in the middle of the frame, while the rest of its body remains on the left side. The serval then re-emerges from behind a green bush and continues walking through the grassy area. The camera tracks the serval, focusing on its head and upper body as it navigates the grassy environment, although it is intermittently obscured by the foreground and middle-ground vegetation. The outdoor setting features a mixture of yellowish-brown stalks and vibrant green foliage, creating a contrasting environment. Despite the dense vegetation, some part of the serval remains visible throughout the video, with its large, rounded ears often visible above the grass.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the serval in the midground. The unsteady camera pans right to track the animal as it moves through the tall grass, pausing briefly around the two-second mark when the serval stops momentarily. The pan then continues, tilting up slightly to keep the serval's head centered in the frame as it begins to move slightly away from the camera's direction.",
    "Subject": "A serval with a tawny, spotted, and striped coat moves through a dense thicket of tall, dry, green, and yellow grass. The wild cat has a slender build and exceptionally large, rounded ears with distinct black and white patches on the back. As it walks, parts of its body are often obscured by the vegetation, but some part of the serval remains visible throughout the video. The camera tracks the serval, focusing on its head and upper body as it navigates the grassy environment.",
    "Motion": "A serval walks from left to right through tall, dense grass, its body partially obscured by the vegetation. It briefly pauses and looks up before continuing its path and moving behind a green bush. The serval then re-emerges from the foliage and continues walking through the grassy area.",
    "Scene": "A serval with a tawny, black-spotted coat moves through a dense thicket of tall, dry grass and green, leafy bushes. The outdoor setting features a mixture of yellowish-brown stalks and vibrant green foliage, creating a contrasting environment. The serval is partially obscured by the vegetation as it walks through the undergrowth, with its large, rounded ears visible above the grass.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a medium shot of a serval, with the camera positioned at the animal's level. The serval is located in the middle ground, surrounded by dense grass and bushes that fill the foreground, middle ground, and background. Initially visible with its head at the left of the frame, the serval consistently walks towards the right side of the frame. As it moves, its head ends up in the middle of the frame, while the rest of its body remains on the left side. The camera pans to follow its movement, keeping the animal's head and upper body as the focal point, although it is intermittently obscured by the foreground and middle-ground vegetation."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
