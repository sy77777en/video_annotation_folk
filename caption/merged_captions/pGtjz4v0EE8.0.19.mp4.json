  "merged_caption": "This wide shot begins from a high-angle, top-down perspective, with a group of people dining at an outdoor restaurant patio occupying the entire frame. The diners, consisting of men and women in casual attire of various colors, including red, blue, and pink shirts, are seated in dark chairs around square tables with light-colored tops, arranged in a grid. The tables are illuminated by small, glowing lamps and are set with white plates containing food and glasses. The restaurant's patio is a raised wooden deck, set upon a street paved with large, gray stone blocks. The diners and their tables are positioned in the middle ground, actively eating and socializing with one another. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly zooms out from the scene, revealing more of the surrounding gray stone pavement in the background at the top, bottom, and left edges of the frame. Multiple people walk past the frame, while the diners remain seated at their tables, with subtle movements as they eat, drink, and converse. This movement causes the patio and the group of diners to transition from filling the screen to being more centrally located, though they remain the dominant element. The camera's deep focus keeps the entire area sharp throughout the shot, capturing the warm, yellow glow cast by the small, downward-facing lights on each table.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
