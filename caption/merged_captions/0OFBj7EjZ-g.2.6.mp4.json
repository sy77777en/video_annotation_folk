  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a minimalist office environment with a wide shot capturing the entire room. The human subject, a person wearing a light blue outfit, is seated at a desk in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The person is focused on a computer screen in front of them, appearing engaged in work or study, and maintains a consistent posture throughout the video. The person is viewed from an aerial perspective, with the camera situated above them. The desk with a computer monitor is in the middle ground on the right, while another empty desk is located in the center, slightly to the left. Two bookshelves line the walls, one on the left side and the other near the subject, both in the middle ground. The tiled floor spans the entire scene, and the spotlight illuminates the central area, leaving the edges darker. The environment is static, with no visible changes in time or motion. The camera features a high-angle aerial view with deep focus, capturing the person seated at the desk. The camera moves upward smoothly, maintaining a fluid motion throughout, although the spatial framing remains unchanged. Overlay text \"[12,13]\" is present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene, and remains static, providing additional context without altering the visual composition. The lighting is focused, illuminating most of the room, while areas outside the room remain dark and are not visible.",

    "Subject": "The video features a single human subject, a person seated at a desk in a minimalist, tiled room. The person is wearing a light blue outfit and is focused on a computer screen in front of them. The desk is equipped with a monitor, and there are shelves and storage units on the walls. The person appears to be engaged in work or study, maintaining a consistent posture throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "A person is seated at a desk, focused on a computer screen in a room with no obvious motion.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor office setting with a minimalist design. The room features a tiled floor and neutral-colored walls. Two desks are positioned against the walls, each equipped with a computer monitor and a chair. Two shelving units are mounted on the walls, providing storage space. The lighting is focused, illuminating most of the room, while areas outside the room remain dark and are not visible. The environment is static, with no visible changes in time or motion.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
