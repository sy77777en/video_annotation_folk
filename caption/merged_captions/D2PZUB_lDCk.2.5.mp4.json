  "merged_caption": "An abstract scene features an undulating surface of shimmering golden particles at the bottom of the frame. A bright, horizontal light source is positioned on the horizon line, from which numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards. Smaller glowing particles are scattered throughout the frame, all drifting in a constant upward motion. The shimmering surface of golden particles at the bottom of the frame undulates gently like calm waves. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of light continuously rise toward the top of the screen. Simultaneously, smaller golden specks of light drift and float upwards throughout the scene, contributing to a constant upward flow. This is a static shot with no camera movement. The dark, brownish-gold background is filled with digital elements, and the bottom of the scene is composed of a dense, undulating surface made of countless tiny, glowing golden particles, resembling a shimmering digital sea. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each with a brighter point at its tip. Throughout the scene, smaller, out-of-focus golden specks of light float and drift, all rising, creating a sense of depth and movement. A bright, horizontal glow is present at the horizon line, serving as the source for the rising light streaks. The landscape of undulating, shimmering golden particles at the bottom features numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rising upwards, varying in length and brightness. A bright, horizontal light source glows at the center of the horizon line. Smaller, glowing golden and white specks drift throughout the space, rising with the light streaks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
