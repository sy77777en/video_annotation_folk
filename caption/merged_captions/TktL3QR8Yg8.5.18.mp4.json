  "merged_caption": "This full shot centers on a rectangular, black-and-white photograph positioned in the middle ground, held by a dark, metallic, multi-pronged, claw-like mechanism, parts of which are visible in the foreground at the bottom, top left, and top right, framing the image. The photograph, exhibiting signs of age such as creases and speckling, depicts a man with dark hair, a dark beard and mustache, and glasses, wearing a collared shirt and a patterned sweater or vest, alongside a young boy with dark hair and wide eyes, wearing a collared shirt and a dark jacket or sweater. Both figures are observing a small, intricate, multi-jointed mechanical contraption, composed of struts and levers, resembling a miniature crane or construction model. The background of the photograph is blurred, focusing attention on the subjects and the contraption. The surrounding environment outside the photograph features deep blue and purple hues and blurred, faint lights, creating a somber atmosphere. The camera is at a level angle, employing an extremely shallow depth of field with focus on the midground photograph. It slowly and smoothly zooms out, providing a broader view and revealing more of the surrounding environment. The background, occupying the periphery, remains dark and out of focus, featuring blurred deep blue and purple lights. The subjects and their framing remain static throughout the shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. Behind the subjects in the photograph, a branch is visible, adding depth to the indoor scene. The video begins with this full shot of the photograph pinned to a dark, metallic surface, and as the camera zooms out, the broader context of the scene is gradually revealed.",

The photograph shows a man and a young boy, both looking intently at a small, intricate mechanical contraption.

    "Scene": "A full shot captures an old, black and white photograph with a deckle edge, held by a dark, metallic, claw-like structure. The photograph, showing some creases and specks, depicts an indoor scene where a man with glasses and a mustache, alongside a young boy with wide eyes, are observing a small, intricate mechanical contraption. Behind them, a branch is visible. The surrounding environment outside the photograph features deep blue and purple hues and blurred, faint lights, creating a somber atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
