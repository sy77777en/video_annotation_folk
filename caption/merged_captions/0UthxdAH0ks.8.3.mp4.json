  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person with short, dark hair, wearing a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt, positioned in the center middle ground, bent over at the waist. The dimly lit room features a lower half of a wall covered in green and white checkered wallpaper, with a small, framed picture of a person blowing a bubble hanging on it. On the left side of the frame, this picture is visible in the middle ground. In the background, a small shelf is visible in the center-right, with a red curtain on the far right. A blurred wall is visible in the foreground on the right side. The person, mostly in silhouette, moves downward and slightly to the left, their back and head occupying the lower-center portion of the frame as they interact with an unseen object on the floor. They repeatedly bend down, adjust their grip, and place the objects on the ground, remaining visible in the middle and lower parts of the frame. The subject primarily occupies the center and bottom of the frame, with slight changes in composition due to the movement of both the camera and the subject. The camera, at eye-level and level-angle, is slightly unsteady, with some shaking as it follows the person's movement, tilting back and forth. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground in focus. The low lighting casts deep shadows throughout the space, making facial details difficult to discern. The person appears to struggle with or move a metal-framed object across the floor, their form mostly in shadow. The camera makes slight movements and shakes to follow the person throughout the action, capturing the dynamics of their interaction with the object.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot is slightly unsteady, with some shaking as the camera follows a person's movement, tilting back and forth. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "A person with short, dark hair is shown in a dimly lit environment, rendered mostly in silhouette. They are wearing a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt. Throughout the video, the individual is bent over at the waist, primarily facing the viewer from the front and side. The facial details are difficult to discern due to their posture and the low lighting. The person is engaged in a physical action, appearing to struggle with or move an unseen object on the floor.",
    "Motion": "A person, seen in silhouette, is bent at the waist, interacting with objects on the floor. They repeatedly bend down, adjust their grip, and place the objects on the ground. Throughout the process, they remain visible in the middle and lower parts of the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room, the lower half of a wall is covered in green and white checkered wallpaper, with a small, framed picture of a person blowing a bubble hanging on it. In the background, a red curtain is partially visible, and a small shelf is mounted on the far wall. A person in a dark t-shirt is bent over in the middle, their form mostly in shadow as they move a metal-framed object across the floor. The low lighting casts deep shadows throughout the space.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a person positioned in the center middle ground, bent over.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
