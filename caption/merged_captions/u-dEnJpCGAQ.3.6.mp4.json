  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a large tiger with vibrant orange fur and distinct black stripes lying on its right side on the ground. The tiger's hind legs and paws, which are white with black markings, are positioned in the left middle ground, while its striped torso extends across the middle ground from the center-left to the right side of the frame. Green plants are visible in the immediate foreground at the bottom and in the background to the left, with a rough, light-brown stone wall occupying the background. The slightly unsteady, fixed camera is positioned at a ground-level, level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire scene with the tiger sharp. The tiger's long, striped tail lifts up over the top of the frame, rotating counterclockwise before curling and lowering back down, seemingly splashing some liquid in the process. The outdoor setting is illuminated by natural light, and the tiger's tail moves up and down in a slow, deliberate motion. The camera remains steady throughout, capturing the tiger's still body and the gentle motion of its tail.",

    "Subject": "A large tiger with vibrant orange fur and distinct black stripes is lying on its right side on the ground. The inside of its legs and its paws are white with black markings. The tiger is resting amongst green plants, with its long, striped tail also visible.",
    "Motion": "A tiger lies on its side on the ground, its body still. Its long, striped tail lifts up into the air, rotating counterclockwise before curling and lowering back down, seemingly splashing some liquid in the process.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting with natural light, a tiger rests on its side near a patch of green grass and leafy plants. A rough, light-brown stone wall forms the background. The tiger's orange and black striped back and hind legs are visible as it lies on the ground. Its long, striped tail moves up and down in a slow, deliberate motion.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a tiger lying on its side. The tiger's hind legs and paws are positioned in the left middle ground, while its striped torso extends across the middle ground from the center-left to the right side of the frame. Green plants are visible in the immediate foreground at the bottom and in the background to the left. A stone wall occupies the background. The tiger's tail lifts up over the top of the frame and then lowers again. The camera is positioned at the tiger's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
