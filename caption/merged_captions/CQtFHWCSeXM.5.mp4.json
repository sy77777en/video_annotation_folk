  "merged_caption": "The video shows a wide shot of the scenery, maintaining a frame focused on a red brick building's exterior. A black wrought iron fence with fleur-de-lis finials is prominent in the foreground, spanning the lower portion of the frame. In the middle ground, to the left, a green bush with red flowers is situated beside an arched wooden door, which is positioned slightly left of the center. A light-colored wall pillar is located in the bottom right, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground. The red brick building itself occupies the background, featuring a black lantern-style light fixture mounted above the door in the center-left. To the right of the door, a tall, narrow arched window is visible, and a portion of another window with dark shutters can be seen in the top right. The camera is positioned at roughly the height of the fence, capturing footage that is shaky and unsteady. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead, using a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera slowly moves to the right, revealing more of the house's facade and the fence. As it moves, the scene captures the interplay of the built environment with the small patch of nature, highlighting the texture and design elements of the red brick building. The video is shot during the day, and the camera's unsteady motion lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static architectural scenery.",

    "Subject": "This architectural scenery shot highlights the exterior details of a red brick building, featuring an arched wooden door, a black wrought iron fence with fleur-de-lis finials, a green bush with red flowers, and a light-colored wall pillar in the lower right corner. The focus is on the texture, design elements, and the interplay of the built environment with the small patch of nature.",
    "Motion": "The video shows the front of a brick house with a wooden door arched by a red brick archway. A black iron fence is in the foreground, and a bush with red flowers is to the left of the door. A black lantern is mounted above the door. The camera slowly moves to the right, revealing more of the house's facade and the fence.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene focused on the entrance of a red brick building. In the foreground, a black metal fence with decorative finials and a white or light-colored stucco wall with a brick-capped top are visible. Behind the fence, a green bush with red flowers stands to the left of an arched wooden door, which has a small, dark window. Above the door, a black lantern-style light fixture is mounted on the brick wall. To the right of the entrance, a tall, narrow arched window is visible. Further right, another window with dark shutters is partially visible on the upper right of the building. The scene is captured during the day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
