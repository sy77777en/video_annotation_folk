  "merged_caption": "A full shot displays a seagull in the middle ground, positioned in the center-left of the frame, perched on a reddish-brown wooden structure that occupies the bottom-left quadrant. The seagull, with a white head and body, gray wings, and a yellow beak, bends its neck and lowers its head while opening its beak wide. Then, it raises its neck but maintains a forward-leaning angle as it closes its beak, as if calling out. The bird remains otherwise stationary throughout the clip. In the background, another white seagull is visible, positioned further away and appearing smaller due to the distance, standing centrally behind the main subject and in front of a low stone wall that stretches horizontally across the frame. A grey utility box is visible in the background on the right side of the scene. The camera, at an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, keeps the seagull in the midground in focus and performs a slight, smooth downward tilt at the subject's level throughout the shot. The scene is set at a harbor or pier during the day under an overcast sky, with the primary seagull's posture and actions as the main focus, its distinct coloring and features clearly visible.",

    "Subject": "The video features a seagull perched on a wooden railing. The seagull has a white head and body with gray wings, and its beak is yellow. It is standing with its body slightly angled, occasionally opening its beak. In the background, another seagull is visible, positioned further away and appearing smaller due to the distance. The primary seagull's posture and actions are the main focus, with its distinct coloring and features clearly visible.",
    "Motion": "At the beginning, the seagull bends its neck and lowers its head while opening its yellow beak wide. Then, it raises its neck but maintains a forward-leaning angle as it closes its beak, as if calling out. The bird remains otherwise stationary throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set at a harbor or pier during the day under an overcast sky. A white and grey seagull with a yellow beak stands on the edge of a reddish-brown wooden structure, its beak open. In the blurred background, another white seagull is visible, along with a low stone wall and a metal railing. To the right, a grey utility box is mounted on a post.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
