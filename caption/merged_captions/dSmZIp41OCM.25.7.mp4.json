  "merged_caption": "A wide, high-angle shot initially frames a humanoid character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head in the center-left middle ground, standing next to a tilled garden plot in the center-right. The character wears a long, hooded, blue-grey cloak covering its body, revealing slender, rod-like legs resembling mechanical rods, and dark brown shoes. A deer is partially visible in the bottom-right foreground, with a house situated in the background at the top of the frame. The scene is a third-person 3D game environment transitioning between outdoor and indoor settings. Outdoors, the scene features a small garden with a patch of tilled soil, surrounded by a white picket fence and a wooden house with a stone path leading to the entrance. The grass is lush and green, indicating a daytime setting with clear weather. The camera captures the avatar's movement from a high, overhead angle, smoothly trucking left and right and moving upward to follow the character as it exits the fenced field on the left side of the frame and runs across the grassy yard toward the entrance of a log cabin in the upper right direction. The character walks from its starting position toward the house at the top-center. As the character enters the house, the front wall becomes transparent, revealing the interior. Indoors, the environment is a cozy wooden room with a warm, rustic feel, featuring a lit fireplace casting a soft glow, a red circular rug, a small round table with a candle holder, and a framed picture on the wall. The character then moves to a workbench located in front of the upper wall of the frame, while the camera maintains its wide, high-angle perspective. Overlay elements include an item bar at the bottom of the screen, a gold icon with the number '471' in the lower left corner, and a status bar in the lower right corner.",

    "Camera": "In a video game scene, the camera captures the avatar's movement from a high, overhead angle. It smoothly trucks left and right and moves upward to follow the character as they walk from a garden plot into a house. The scene is captured with a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp.",
    "Subject": "A humanoid character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head is shown. The head has simple, carved-out eyes and a smiling mouth. This character wears a long, hooded, blue-grey cloak that covers its body, revealing slender, rod-like legs resembling mechanical rods, and it is wearing dark brown shoes. In the bottom right corner, the upper body of a brown deer with white spots and large antlers is partially visible.",
    "Motion": "A humanoid character with a pumpkin-like head exits a fenced field on the left side of the frame and runs across the grassy yard toward the entrance of a log cabin in the upper right direction. It proceeds to run directly through the closed wooden door, entering the house, and then walks a few steps inside.",
    "Scene": "The video is a third-person 3D game scene where the entire character is visible on screen, transitioning between outdoor and indoor settings. Outdoors, the scene features a small garden with a patch of tilled soil, surrounded by a white picket fence and a wooden house with a stone path leading to the entrance. The grass is lush and green, indicating a daytime setting with clear weather. Indoors, the environment is a cozy wooden room with a warm, rustic feel, featuring a lit fireplace casting a soft glow, a red circular rug, a small round table with a candle holder, and a framed picture on the wall. The character interacts with various objects, such as tending to plants outside and engaging with furniture inside. Overlay elements include an item bar at the bottom of the screen, a gold icon with the number '471' in the lower left corner, and a status bar in the lower right corner, which are not part of the scene itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
