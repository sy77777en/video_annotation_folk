  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot looking up at an ornate, coffered ceiling that occupies the top half of the frame, featuring intricate patterns and two large, bowl-shaped chandeliers with dark metalwork hanging in the foreground on the left and right. The camera, capturing a smooth, first-person view shot from eye-level, starts with a low-angle view of the ceiling, then tilts downward continuously, revealing a large, arched window in the center middle ground, framed by a string of small, bright lights. Through the window panes, a street scene with a parked car is visible in the evening light. As the camera continues to tilt down, it reveals a wide staircase with marble-like balustrades leading to a landing with an intricate mosaic tile floor. This movement transitions the frame to a medium shot of a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a brown coat and carrying a black bag, seen from behind. She is positioned in the center-right foreground on the mosaic-tiled landing, framed by staircase balustrades on the left and right. The woman continuously walks down the stairs and away from the camera, descending towards the tiled floor with a decorative design. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire ornate interior sharp, and transitions to a high-angle perspective looking down at the landing. The transition from the ceiling to the woman highlights the grandeur of the setting and her movement within it, suggesting an elegant interior space. The perspective and camera movement create a temporally coherent narrative, capturing the dynamics of the scene as the woman descends the staircase, facing away from the camera, towards the intricately designed floor.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking up at an ornate, coffered ceiling inside a grand, dimly lit hall. Two large, bowl-shaped chandeliers with dark metalwork hang from the ceiling, illuminating decorative friezes with inscriptions along the upper walls. The view tilts down to reveal a large, arched window framed by a string of small, bright lights. Through the window panes, a street scene with a parked car is visible in the evening light. The perspective continues downward, showing a wide staircase with marble-like balustrades leading to a landing with an intricate mosaic tile floor, where a person with blonde hair is seen from behind.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot looking up at an ornate ceiling that occupies the top half of the frame, with two chandeliers hanging in the foreground on the left and right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
