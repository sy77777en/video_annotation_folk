  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape during sunset, filmed by a drone with noticeable fisheye distortion curving straight lines outward. The camera captures a broad view of the urban environment, showing the entire construction site and surrounding buildings. Initially, a building with a red exterior occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground, while two large construction cranes dominate the center and slightly to the right in the middle ground. The cranes extend vertically, reaching into the sky. The construction site extends from the foreground into the middle ground, with various building materials scattered across it, including metal beams and concrete forms. In the background, a modern glass skyscraper is visible in the right-center, contributing to the urban skyline. The sky transitions from a bright blue to warm oranges and yellows, creating a dramatic atmosphere. The camera drone starts at an aerial level while maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, starting with a level angle, smoothly moves forward over the cityscape at dusk, providing a closer look at the crane and the construction materials scattered around the site. As the camera moves forward, the red building gradually exits the frame from the left, shifting the focus more towards the center where the cranes remain prominent. The red concrete pump, initially positioned in the center-right of the middle ground, also fades out of view. The camera continues to move forward, focusing on the crane and the buildings in the background, which include a tall glass building and other high-rise structures. The video concludes with a closer view of the crane and the surrounding buildings, highlighting the ongoing construction work against the backdrop of the setting sun, and finishes with a slight upward tilt to a low angle.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera drone starts at an aerial level while maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera drone, starting with a level angle, smoothly moves forward over a cityscape at dusk, and finishes with a slight upward tilt to a low angle.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban environment at sunset, with the focus on the expansive view rather than a specific object. The scene includes towering cranes and modern glass buildings, emphasizing the scale and development of the city. The sky is painted with a gradient of warm oranges and cool blues, creating a dramatic atmosphere. The composition highlights the interplay between the constructed environment and the natural beauty of the sunset, rather than centering on a single subject.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a construction site at sunset, featuring a large crane in the center, surrounded by partially built structures and high-rise buildings. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a closer look at the crane and the construction materials scattered around the site. The sky is a warm orange as the sun sets, casting a golden glow over the scene. The camera continues to move forward, focusing on the crane and the buildings in the background, which include a tall glass building and other high-rise structures. The video concludes with a closer view of the crane and the surrounding buildings, highlighting the ongoing construction work against the backdrop of the setting sun.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor construction site in a city at sunset. The sky transitions from a bright blue to a warm orange and yellow. Several tall buildings surround the construction site, including a modern glass skyscraper. Two large construction cranes stand prominently within the site, their metal frames reaching high into the sky. The construction site itself is filled with metal beams, concrete forms, and other building materials. A red concrete pump is also visible. As the camera moves forward, a building with a completed red exterior wall on the left side gradually disappears from the frame.",

The camera maintains a height above the construction site, providing a clear aerial perspective throughout the sequence. The sky, transitioning from blue to warm hues, serves as a backdrop, enhancing the depth of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
