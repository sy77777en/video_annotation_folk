  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. An extreme wide shot captures the top of a large, industrial bridge structure from a high-angle perspective, with the camera moving left throughout the video. From a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, the camera trucks left, maintaining a deep focus on a large bridge spanning over water, partially obscured by thick fog. The metallic, triangular framework is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The entire scene is enveloped by thick fog that fills the foreground and appears to continue into the background, moving from left to right across the frame like clouds carried by the wind. The bridge appears to be constructed over water, which extends from the middle ground to the background. The only discernible movement within the frame is the drifting fog and tiny vehicles traveling from left to right across the bridge deck below the central truss. The video captures a large metal bridge partially obscured by thick fog, creating a mysterious and atmospheric scene. The fog drifts slowly, revealing more of the bridge's intricate framework. This video presents an atmospheric, aerial scenery shot of a massive industrial bridge spanning over water. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the overwhelming environment, creating a sense of mystery and immense scale. A large, metallic, truss-like framework with a peaked roofline looms in the center, its full form obscured by thick, swirling grey fog that dominates the entire view, making the structure appear ethereal and ghost-like. A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a large, industrial metal bridge shrouded in thick, swirling grey fog or steam. The top of the bridge, which has a triangular, truss-like framework, is partially visible through the dense vapor. Cars can be seen traveling from left to right across the bridge, appearing small due to the camera's distance. The entire scene is monochromatic, dominated by shades of grey, as the fog obscures the surrounding environment and the base of the bridge.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
