  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a seated humanoid figure with a metallic silver, featureless head and silver forearms is positioned in the center middle ground at a brown desk, typing on a vintage beige keyboard. This figure wears a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants with a brown belt. A second standing figure, similarly styled with a silver head and arms, wearing a tan, short-sleeved shirt with chest pockets, a brown belt, and dark pants, is located behind it in the left side middle ground, looking down at the seated figure. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, executes a smooth truck to the left with a brief tilt upward at the start, revealing three additional standing figures entering the frame from the left. One of these figures, wearing a light grey, long-sleeved collared shirt and grey pants, stands beside the second figure, also looking down toward the desk. To the left of this third figure, there are two additional figures wearing tan collared shirts. All five figures have the same metallic, featureless heads and remain stationary throughout the clip. The camera movement forms a line from the middle ground to the foreground behind the seated figure. By the end of the movements, the seated figure and desk occupy the right side of the frame, while the line of standing figures fills the center and left, with the second standing figure moving to the center-right. The scene is set in an office-like environment against a solid black background, and the deep focus keeps the figures and the computer sharp. A white text overlay at the bottom-left of the screen provides the caption \"[4]\".",

    "Camera": "From a level, eye-level perspective, the camera executes a smooth truck to the left, with a brief tilt upward at the start. The scene appears to be in deep focus, keeping the figures and the computer sharp against the dark background.",
    "Subject": "A humanoid figure with a silver, featureless head and silver forearms sits hunched in a black office chair, typing on a vintage beige keyboard at a desk. This figure wears a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants with a brown belt. Standing directly behind it is a second humanoid figure, similarly styled with a silver head and arms, wearing a tan, short-sleeved shirt with chest pockets, a brown belt, and dark pants, looking down at the seated figure. A third humanoid figure, wearing a light grey, long-sleeved collared shirt and grey pants, enters from the left and stands beside the second figure, also looking down toward the desk. To the left of this third figure, there are two additional figures wearing tan collared shirts. All five figures have the same metallic, featureless heads.",
    "Motion": "A humanoid figure sits hunched over a desk, its silver fingers resting on a keyboard. A second, similar figure stands motionless behind it, looking down. As the camera shifts, a third humanoid figure becomes visible next to the standing figure, also looking down at the one seated. Two additional figures are partially visible on the far left, remaining stationary throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "In an office-like setting against a solid black background, a figure with a metallic silver head and hands sits in a black chair at a brown desk, posed in a typing posture on a vintage beige computer. The figure is dressed in a tan short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. Standing behind the chair, another similar figure in the same attire observes. As the scene moves to the left, more standing figures are revealed, one of whom is wearing a light grey shirt. All figures have featureless, metallic silver heads and hands. A white text overlay at the bottom-left of the screen provides the caption \"[4]\".",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a seated humanoid figure is positioned in the center middle ground at a desk, with a second standing figure located behind it in the left side middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly moves to the left. This movement reveals three additional standing figures entering the frame from the left, forming a line from the middle ground to the foreground behind the seated figure. By the end of the movements, the seated figure and desk occupy the right side of the frame, while the line of standing figures fills the center and left, with the second standing figure moving to the center-right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
