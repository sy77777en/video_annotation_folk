  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a red, featureless, mannequin-like figure lies on the ground in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Its legs are bent, and its arms are positioned in front of its torso. A blue, featureless, mannequin-like figure stands over it, also located in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with its arms bent in front of its torso, as if it is catching or interacting with the red figure. Both figures are illuminated by a spotlight from above, casting a cone of light onto them. The ground within the illuminated area shows a dashed white line visible in both the bottom left and top right corners, and a solid yellow line in the bottom right. The scene is captured at night on a dark asphalt surface, possibly a road or parking lot, with the surroundings in complete darkness. The video displays a static scene with no movement of the figures. From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly moves backward and upward while rolling counterclockwise to reveal a wider view of the scene. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp throughout.",

    "Subject": "In a dark setting illuminated by a single spotlight from above, a solid red, featureless, mannequin-like figure lies on its side on a paved surface. Its legs are bent, and its arms are positioned in front of its torso. Standing over the red figure is a solid blue, featureless, mannequin-like figure, with its arms bent in front of its torso, as if it is catching or interacting with the red figure.",
    "Motion": "The video displays a static scene with no movement. A red, mannequin-like figure lies on a paved surface, while a blue, mannequin-like figure stands over it, more brightly illuminated within a spotlight.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, a scene is captured at night on a dark asphalt surface, possibly a road or parking lot. A single, bright spotlight from above illuminates a section of the flat road, leaving the surroundings in complete darkness. Within the light, a solid red, featureless mannequin lies on the ground. A second, hazy blue mannequin stands over it. The ground within the illuminated area shows a dashed white line and a solid yellow line.",
    "Spatial": "In a high-angle wide shot, a red figure lies on the ground in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A blue figure stands over it, also located in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, illuminated by a spotlight from above, casting a cone of light onto the figures. A white dashed line is visible in both the bottom left and top right corners, and a yellow solid line is in the bottom right. The shot remains static throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
