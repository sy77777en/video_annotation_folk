  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a full shot of a television screen mounted to the ceiling, positioned in the center of the frame, displaying a news broadcast of a skyscraper with a large plume of dark smoke rising from it, accompanied by a news ticker at the bottom. This low-angle, eye-level shot starts out of focus before quickly sharpening into deep focus. The camera then performs a slightly unsteady zoom-out, revealing more of the office environment, including desks, overhead lighting, and a tiled ceiling with fluorescent lighting. As the camera zooms out, two people's heads are shown in close-up in the foreground, with one in the lower-left wearing a white shirt with a black plaid pattern and having short, dark hair, and the other in the lower-right wearing a blue shirt and glasses with short hair. Both individuals are looking up at the TV. The office environment is depicted in a wide shot in the middle ground and background, with the television now located in the upper-center of the frame. The spacious, open-plan office is filled with cubicles and desks, and a white pillar in the middle ground to the right has a sign that reads \"BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS.\" Several people are gathered in the background, likely watching a screen in front of them, while other office workers are visible at their desks. The office appears to be a professional setting, with people engaged in their work.",

    "Scene": "In a spacious, open-plan office with a tiled ceiling and fluorescent lighting, a black, boxy television is mounted and angled downward. Two people in the foreground, one on each side, look up at the TV. The screen displays news footage of a skyscraper with a large plume of dark smoke rising from it, accompanied by a news ticker at the bottom. The office space is filled with cubicles and desks, and a white pillar in the background has a sign that reads \"BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS.\" Several people are gathered in the background, likely watching a screen in front of them.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
