  "merged_caption": "A 2D animated red sports car with a sleek, low-profile body and a black roof is shown in the center of the frame, moving from left to right across a gray road marked with white dashed lines. The car features dark gray wheels with numerous thin, yellow spokes that spin as it travels. Positioned on the front hood is a black video camera attached to a white mount, oriented towards the car's windshield. The scene is set against a plain white background, with small, scattered black horizontal lines shifting leftward, resembling rocks being passed by the moving car. The camera provides a smooth side-tracking shot, moving rightward and zooming in on the vehicle as it travels. Throughout the shot, the view remains consistent, showing the car from the side. As the car continues its journey, the road scrolls past in the background, enhancing the sense of motion. At the end of the video, a black component extends from the back of the camera and connects to the car's hood, completing the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth side-tracking shot of a red car. The camera moves rightward and zooms in on the vehicle as it travels.",
    "Subject": "A 2D animation depicts a dark red, two-door sports car with a sleek, low-profile body. The car features a black roof and black lower body panels. Its wheels are dark gray with numerous thin, yellow spokes. Positioned on the front hood of the car is a black video camera attached to a white mount, oriented towards the car's windshield. The car is shown in profile, facing to the right, on a gray road with white dashed lines. At the end of the video, a black component extends from the back of the camera and connects to the car's hood.",
    "Motion": "The 2D animated red sports car moves forward from left to right across the screen. As the car travels, its wheels rotate, and the road scrolls past in the background. At the end of the video, a black object extends from the back of the camera and attaches to the hood of the car.",
    "Scene": "A two-dimensional animation shows a red sports car with a black roof and a camera mounted on its hood. The car moves from left to right across a grey road marked with white dashed lines, its dark grey wheels with yellow spokes spinning. The entire scene is set against a plain white background, featuring small, scattered black horizontal lines that shift leftward, resembling rocks being passed by the moving car.",
    "Spatial": "A 2D animated red sports car is shown in the center of the frame, moving from left to right across a gray road. Small black lines in the white background move in the opposite direction, from right to left, creating a sense of motion. The view remains consistent, showing the car from the side throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
