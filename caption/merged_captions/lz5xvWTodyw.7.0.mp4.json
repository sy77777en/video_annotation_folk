  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of an industrial corridor, centrally framed and extending from the foreground deep into the background, creating a strong sense of linear perspective as it recedes into a hazy, dark vanishing point. The camera is positioned at an eye-level height, offering a straight-on view down the length of the hallway. The shot is smooth and moves forward down the long, dimly lit hallway, maintaining a level angle with deep focus keeping the entire corridor, from the foreground to the distant end, clear and in focus. The corridor is illuminated by a series of wall-mounted lights, each positioned above a white door, casting cones of white light onto the dark, polished floor. The walls are made of painted cinder blocks with a greenish hue, and pipes run along the ceiling. The doors and lights are arranged symmetrically along the left and right walls, starting in the middle ground and continuing into the background. Yellow safety markings are visible on the floor, and industrial equipment, including pallet jacks and stacked boxes, is scattered in the shadows along the sides. At the end of the video, a pallet jack is partially visible in the bottom left foreground, another is on the right in the middle ground, and boxes are on both sides. The environment is bathed in an eerie, dim white light, and the hallway stretches into a hazy, indistinct distance. There is no main subject in the video, and the first-person POV shot gives the impression of looking through the character’s eyes as the scene unfolds.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot moving forward down a long, dimly lit hallway. The camera maintains a level angle, and a deep focus keeps the entire corridor, from the foreground to the distant end, clear and in focus.",
    "Subject": "This is an industrial corridor scenery shot depicting a long, straight hallway receding into a hazy, dark distance. The environment is bathed in an eerie, dim white light emanating from fixtures mounted above a series of identical white doors that line the cinder block walls. The light casts reflections on the dark, smooth floor, where yellow safety markings are visible, and industrial equipment, including pallet jacks and stacked boxes, are scattered in the shadows along the sides. There is no main subject in the video.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a long, dark hallway. The corridor is illuminated by a series of wall-mounted lights that cast a white glow, reflecting off the dark, polished floor. White doors line the cinder block walls, which have a greenish hue, and equipment like pallet jacks is scattered throughout.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down a long, dark indoor corridor. The walls are made of painted cinder blocks with a greenish hue, and pipes run along the ceiling, with the hallway stretching into a hazy, indistinct distance. The scene is illuminated by a series of wall-mounted lights, each positioned above a white door, casting cones of white light onto the dark, reflective floor. The doors are arranged symmetrically on both sides of the hall, and several pallet jacks are positioned intermittently along the walls.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
