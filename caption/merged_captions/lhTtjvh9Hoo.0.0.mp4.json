  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a light tan lioness lying down in the middle ground, facing slightly towards the camera. The lioness holds a dark, reddish-brown, slightly cylindrical object between its front paws, actively licking and gnawing on it, with its eyes partially closed and ears perked up. The foreground consists of the ground, a mix of light brown sand and patches of short green grass, along with a few small plants on the left side of the frame. In the background, dense green foliage is visible across the top right, while a rock formation or textured wall appears in the top left background, suggesting an enclosure. The video is set outdoors on a sunny day, with bright light casting shadows, and sunlight illuminating the lioness's fur, making the fur on the left side of the frame appear more radiant. Initially, the lioness's head is upright as she engages with the object. As she adjusts her posture, her head rolls downward to her left, and she extends her tongue to continue licking and gnawing, occasionally adjusting her grip and position. The camera is at ground level, maintaining a level angle and exhibits very smooth, minor forward movement. The focus is deep, with a large depth of field, keeping the lioness and her surroundings sharp. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the video.",

    "Motion": "A lioness is lying on a sandy surface with some grass and greenery in the background. She is holding a dark, reddish-brown object between her front paws and is licking and gnawing on it. Initially, her head is upright as she engages with the object. As she adjusts her posture, her head rolls downward to her left, and she extends her tongue to continue licking and gnawing, occasionally adjusting her grip and position.",
    "Scene": "The video is set outdoors on a sunny day, with bright light casting shadows. The ground is a mix of light brown sand or dirt and patches of short green grass. In the background, there is dense green foliage and what appears to be a rock formation or a textured wall, suggesting an enclosure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
