  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a snowy landscape, featuring a large concrete bunker slightly off-center in the upper-right background and a more distant, somewhat blurred bunker in the upper-left background. In the foreground, a thick rope extends from the left side into the middle ground, while bare branches occupy the right foreground. The camera starts from a relatively high angle with deep focus on the background bunkers and then transitions to a level perspective, pulling back to reveal the mid-torso and hands of a person entering the frame from the left foreground. This person, wearing a heavy coat, grips the rope with both hands, pulling it with force. The sequence begins with the rope already in motion across the snowy ground. A hand enters the frame from the left, grips the rope, and continues to pull it backward, with the camera's perspective moving in unison. The camera moves backward slowly and with some slight shaking, then pans slightly to the left and tilts upward, transitioning to a level angle. As this occurs, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, bringing the person in the foreground into focus. The ground in the middle ground is covered with uneven, trodden snow, revealing patches of dark earth. In the final composition, the person remains partially visible in the left foreground, with the bunkers appearing smaller in the background. A second, similar structure is visible in the distance to the left. The video, shot in black and white, captures the stark contrast of the scene, emphasizing the texture of the snow and the roughness of the rope. The bare branches of a bush are prominent in the foreground on the right, adding to the desolate atmosphere of the setting.",

    "Camera": "This is a hip-level shot that begins with a high angle and deep focus on the background bunkers. The camera moves backward slowly and with some slight shaking. It then pans slightly to the left and tilts upward, transitioning to a level angle. As this occurs, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, bringing the person in the foreground into focus.",
    "Subject": "The video, shot in black and white, initially focuses on a thick rope lying on a snowy ground, extending from the foreground towards the middle of the scene. As the perspective pulls back, a person becomes partially visible on the far left. This individual is seen from the waist to the hips, wearing a heavy coat. His right hand is gripping the rope and pulling with force, while his left hand is also assisting in the effort.",
    "Motion": "The sequence begins with a thick rope already in motion across the snowy ground. A hand then enters the frame from the left, grips the rope, and continues to pull it backward, with the camera's perspective moving in unison.",
    "Scene": "In a black-and-white outdoor scene, a large concrete bunker is situated on a small dune covered in snow and sparse grass. A second, similar structure is visible in the distance to the left. The ground in the middle ground is covered with uneven, trodden snow, revealing patches of dark earth. A thick rope lies across the snow, leading from the middle ground towards the left of the frame. A hand holding a coiled section of the rope enters the shot from the left, pulling it slightly. On the right, the bare branches of a bush are prominent in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a snowy landscape, featuring a large concrete bunker slightly off-center in the upper-right background and a more distant, somewhat blurred bunker in the upper-left background. In the foreground, a thick rope extends from the left side into the middle ground, while bare branches occupy the right foreground. The camera starts from a relatively high angle and then transitions to a level perspective, pulling back to reveal the mid-torso and hands of a person entering the frame from the left foreground. This person pulls the rope, which now stretches from their position across the middle ground. In the final composition, the person remains partially visible in the left foreground, with the bunkers appearing smaller in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
