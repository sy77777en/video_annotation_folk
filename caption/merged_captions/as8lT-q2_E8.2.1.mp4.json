  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures two riders on futuristic motorcycles positioned side-by-side in the foreground, with the camera tracking from in front of them. The rider with orange accents is on the left, wearing a form-fitting black suit and a matching helmet, both accented with glowing orange lines that trace the contours of their body and head. Their motorcycle is black with glowing orange highlights on its large, hubless wheels and body, and features two bright white headlights. The rider with green accents is on the right, in a similar racing posture, with a black suit and helmet detailed with glowing light green lines. Their motorcycle mirrors the design of the first but is accented with the same light green color and also has bright white headlights. Set against a dark background with out-of-focus stadium lights, the scene unfolds in a dark, futuristic arena at night, featuring a sleek, reflective ground plane. As both riders move forward in unison, the camera continues to track them from a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective, moving backward and maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the riders in the midground while blurring the background. The rider on the right gradually pulls ahead, moving into the foreground and to the right of the frame, eventually exiting the frame completely, while the rider on the left shifts further left. After a collision between the two, the rider on the orange motorcycle renders the other rider unconscious and subsequently adjusts the speed of the green motorcycle as they continue through the dark environment. The glowing tracks left beneath their wheels add a dynamic and visually striking element to the scene, illuminating the path ahead as they move forward.",

    "Camera": "From a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective, the camera moves backward, leading two figures on futuristic motorcycles. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the riders in the midground, blurring the background.",
    "Subject": "Two riders on futuristic motorcycles are positioned side-by-side, facing forward. The rider on the left wears a form-fitting black suit and a matching helmet, both accented with glowing orange lines that trace the contours of their body and head. They are leaning forward over their motorcycle, which is also black with glowing orange highlights on its large, hubless wheels and body, and features two bright white headlights. To the right, a second rider is in a similar racing posture on another motorcycle. This rider's black suit and helmet are detailed with glowing light green lines. Their motorcycle mirrors the design of the first but is accented with the same light green color and also has bright white headlights.",
    "Motion": "Two riders on futuristic motorcycles, one accented in orange and the other in green, travel forward in unison. After a collision between the two, the rider on the orange motorcycle renders the other rider unconscious and subsequently adjusts the speed of the green motorcycle as they continue through a dark environment.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a dark, futuristic arena at night, featuring a sleek, reflective ground plane. In the background, faint, out-of-focus lights hint at stadium architecture. Two figures ride side-by-side on futuristic motorcycles, leaving glowing tracks beneath their wheels that add a dynamic and visually striking element to the scene. The motorcycle on the left is black with bright orange neon accents, while the one on the right is black with greenish-cyan neon highlights. Both vehicles boast large, glowing, hubless wheels and bright white headlights, illuminating the path ahead as they move forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
