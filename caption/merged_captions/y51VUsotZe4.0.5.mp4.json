  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot captured from a level angle, resembling a dash-camera view from inside a vehicle. A wet road occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. Buildings with numerous neon signs line both the left and right sides of the frame, creating a corridor effect. These signs are positioned in both the middle ground and background, and their colorful lights reflect onto the wet pavement in the foreground and middle ground. The viewpoint advances forward, enhancing the sense of immersion. The video captures a dash-camera view from inside a car, moving forward along a wet city street at night, presenting an unsteady, eye-level perspective. The shot maintains a fixed Dutch angle, tilting the view of the neon-lit buildings. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp, and trucks slightly to the left as if changing lanes. This is a scenery shot from a moving vehicle's perspective, driving through a bustling Asian city at night. The streets are wet and reflective after a rain, amplifying the glow of the numerous, vibrant neon signs that line the buildings. The camera uses a wide, tilted lens, creating an immersive view of the urban landscape as it glides past. A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive through a city street at night. The pavement is wet, reflecting the vibrant glow from an abundance of colorful neon signs that adorn the multi-story buildings on both sides of the road. These signs, displaying Chinese characters, illuminate the scene in shades of red, green, yellow, and blue. As the vehicle moves forward along the dark street, it passes a white car parked on the right, with the lights of distant traffic visible ahead. The wide-angle lens provides an immersive perspective.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
