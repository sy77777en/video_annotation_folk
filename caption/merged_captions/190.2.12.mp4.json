  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of two men positioned side by side outdoors at night in an urban setting. The man on the left has a dark skin tone, short hair, and is wearing a dark jacket over a striped shirt, appearing to look slightly upward while speaking. The man on the right has a medium skin tone, short hair, a goatee, and is wearing glasses, a dark jacket, and a brown sweater, facing forward with a neutral expression. Both men are closely positioned, suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience or conversation. The background consists of dimly lit buildings and trees, creating a subdued atmosphere with dark silhouettes softened by the dim light. The lighting is soft, with a few artificial lights illuminating parts of the scene, casting subtle reflections on nearby surfaces. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones. The camera features a low-angle shot at eye level, focusing on the two men in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. It moves smoothly backward, leading the men from the front with minimal shaking, while both men move slowly forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
