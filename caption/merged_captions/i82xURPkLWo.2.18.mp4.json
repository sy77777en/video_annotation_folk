  "merged_caption": "This wide shot features a bald man in a light blue button-down shirt sitting on a brown leather couch in the middle ground, positioned on the right side of the frame. In the background center, a muscular Black man with short hair, wearing a mauve t-shirt and dark jeans, emerges from a doorway holding a red can and a green bottle. Behind the seated man and to the left, a mint-green tool cabinet occupies the background, with its doors open to reveal a neat arrangement of tools, and a workbench is positioned in front of it in the middle ground. A white sink is visible in the middle ground on the right, and a framed picture of a lighthouse hangs on the wooden wall. The man in the mauve t-shirt walks from the background into the middle ground, moving towards the left side of the frame and approaching the seated man. The seated man remains on the couch, gesturing with his hands and turning his head slightly to his right to face the other man. In the second half of the video, the seated man begins to speak while facing the camera, then looks slightly to his right as the other man approaches and offers the can. The seated man gestures with his hand to decline the drink. The scene is set inside a rustic, wood-paneled room during the daytime, illuminated by soft, natural light from several windows. The camera is positioned at hip level, using a static shot with deep focus to keep both the man sitting on the couch in the middle ground and the man walking from the background to the middle ground in sharp focus.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
