  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a Black woman with a muscular build, dressed in a grey sports bra and black shorts, positioned in the foreground of the frame as she executes a flip. Her long, black hair is styled in a high ponytail, and she wears small white earbuds. The scene takes place inside a spacious gymnastics training facility under bright, even lighting. The camera, positioned at her level, dynamically rotates clockwise to follow her movement, causing the background gym apparatus, including balance beams and uneven bars with blue and red elements, to spin and blur. As she moves through the air, her body remains centered in the frame, moving from the bottom to the top. The female gymnast executes three forward rolls as part of an intricate gymnastics routine, landing on a large blue floor mat with red and white boundary lines that extends from the middle ground to the background. The camera starts at a level angle and then rolls clockwise quickly and with some unsteadiness to follow her 360° rotations, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the background relatively sharp. Rolled-up mats are stored against a light grey wall, which features a grid-like pattern on its upper section. The shot ends with her standing in the foreground at the center of the frame, with her arms raised. Various pieces of gymnastics equipment are visible in the background.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion, eye-level video tracks a woman from the side as she performs flips in a gym. The camera starts at a level angle and then rolls clockwise quickly and with some unsteadiness to follow her 360° rotations. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the background relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "A Black woman with a muscular build is shown performing a gymnastics routine. Her long, black hair is styled in a high ponytail. She is dressed in a grey sports bra and black shorts, and she wears small white earbuds. Throughout the sequence, she is seen in various dynamic poses, flipping through the air.",
    "Motion": "The female gymnast executes three forward rolls as part of an intricate gymnastics routine, landing on a blue mat and raising her arms to finish.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a spacious gymnastics training facility under bright, even lighting. A large blue floor mat with red and white boundary lines covers the ground. In the background, various pieces of gymnastics apparatus are visible, including balance beams and uneven bars with blue and red elements.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
