  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, level-angle shot of a poolside at night. The pool extends from the foreground into the middle ground, occupying the bottom half of the frame. The pool's edge runs from the foreground into the middle ground. A house is visible in the background, positioned in the left and center of the frame, with palm trees silhouetted in front of it across the top. Initially, a single jet of water arcs from the right side of the frame at the pool edge in the foreground, landing in the left-bottom part of the pool. A second jet then appears to its left, followed by a third, larger jet that enters from the right side of the frame, also arcing into the pool. The camera continuously pans left throughout the shot. From an above-water, level angle, the camera smoothly pans left across a swimming pool at night. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, particularly the edge of the pool where water jets are active, and highlighting the arched streams of water being emitted. The pool is illuminated from below by a vibrant green light, with dark leaves floating on its surface. Several arcing streams of water, appearing a light turquoise color, spray from the stone edge and splash into the pool. In the background, a house with a tiled roof has warm lights glowing from its windows and from exterior lanterns. The area is surrounded by the dark silhouettes of palm trees and other foliage against the night sky, with lounge chairs visible on the pool deck. The primary motion in the video comes from fountains spraying arcs of water into the pool. The pool water glows with an ethereal green light from below, its surface dotted with dark leaves. Arcing jets of water, catching the green luminescence, spray into the pool from its stone edge.",

    "Subject": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a luxurious poolside at night. The focus is on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating an immersive environmental view. The pool water glows with an ethereal green light from below, its surface dotted with dark leaves. Arcing jets of water, catching the green luminescence, spray into the pool from its stone edge. In the background, a large house with a tiled roof is softly illuminated by warm wall lanterns, and tall palm trees are silhouetted against the dark, starry sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a nighttime scene of a swimming pool illuminated by a vibrant green light from below. In the background, a house with warm lights is visible behind several palm trees. The primary motion in the video comes from fountains spraying arcs of water into the pool.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
