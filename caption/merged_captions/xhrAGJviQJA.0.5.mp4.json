  "merged_caption": "A medium shot, taken from a selfie perspective, features a light-skinned woman with short, curly, bright orange hair in a bright blue, short-sleeved button-up shirt and green rectangular sunglasses, positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. Flanking her in the middle ground are two light-brown-skinned women: one with dark, curly, shoulder-length hair, dressed in a pink and red patterned long-sleeved shirt and yellow cat-eye sunglasses on the left, and another with long, dark hair pulled back, wearing a white t-shirt, blue earrings, and yellow-brown sunglasses, posing with one hand on her head on the right. Both are positioned slightly behind the central woman. The white, textured rooftop they are on occupies the middle ground, with a cityscape of numerous buildings of varying heights and architectural styles visible in the background under a clear, bright blue sky during the day. The scene is brightly lit by direct sunlight. The camera, held by the central woman, begins with a slight tilt downward before stabilizing and remaining stationary at the subjects' level for the rest of the shot. It then performs a slight clockwise roll. The woman in the middle adjusts the camera angle while the two women on either side alter their postures as they pose for a selfie on the rooftop. This eye-level, level-angle shot is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures three people on a white, textured rooftop under a clear, bright blue sky during the day. In the background, a cityscape with numerous buildings of varying heights and architectural styles is visible. The person in the center, wearing a blue shirt and green sunglasses, holds the camera, while two others pose on either side. The scene is brightly lit by direct sunlight.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot, taken from a selfie perspective, features a woman in a blue shirt positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. Flanking her in the middle ground are two other women: one in a pink and red shirt on the left and another in a white shirt on the right. Both are positioned slightly behind the central woman.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
