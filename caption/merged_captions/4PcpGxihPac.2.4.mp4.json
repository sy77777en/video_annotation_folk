  "merged_caption": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a close-up shot captures a middle-aged, light-skinned man with a full, dark beard and mustache, centrally framed and occupying the foreground. His face is covered in what appears to be red blood, with cuts and abrasions visible on his forehead and cheeks. His dark hair is unkempt, and he stares forward with wide, dark eyes and an intense expression, his mouth slightly open. He wears a light-colored, worn-looking garment. The camera is positioned at his eye level, capturing his head and shoulders against a dark, out-of-focus background. A cool, blue-green light from above illuminates the subject, creating a grainy texture. The framing remains static throughout the shot, with the camera using an extremely shallow depth of field to focus on the man's face in the foreground. The subject in the video remains completely still.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
