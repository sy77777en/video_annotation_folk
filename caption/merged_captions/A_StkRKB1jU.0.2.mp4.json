  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing in the center-middle ground on a city street corner. He is dressed in a dark suit jacket and matching trousers, with a large, blue, rectangular duffel bag slung over his right shoulder. In his left hand, he holds a white clown mask with red-rimmed eyes, a red nose, and blue markings on the forehead and cheeks. A large black pole occupies the left foreground. Buildings and pedestrians are visible in the middle ground and background on both sides of the frame. The scene is set on a wide city street corner under bright, clear daylight, with paved roads marked with white lines, flanked by sidewalks and tall, multi-story buildings constructed from light-colored stone and brick. In the background, taller skyscrapers and an elevated train track are visible. Various signs, including a green \"P\" for parking and a \"PAYDAY LOANS\" storefront, are seen along the street. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, focuses on the man in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field that blurs the city background. The camera executes a smooth forward dolly and downward tilt, transitioning from a level to a high angle as it moves closer to the man and the clown mask he is holding. The camera then moves in, reframing the subject into a medium shot. In this closer view, the man remains in the center, with the clown mask now positioned in the bottom-left of the frame and the duffel bag on the right. As the shot tightens, a white van with a black lower section enters from the left and moves across the middle ground from left to right. The man stands still as the camera gradually approaches him from behind, and at the end, he gets ready to move forward.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set on a wide city street corner under bright, clear daylight. The paved road, marked with white lines, is flanked by sidewalks and tall, multi-story buildings constructed from light-colored stone and brick.

A thick black pole stands in the foreground, and various signs, including a green \"P\" for parking and a \"PAYDAY LOANS\" storefront, are seen along the street.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
