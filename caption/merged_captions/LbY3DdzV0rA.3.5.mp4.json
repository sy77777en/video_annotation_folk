  "merged_caption": "This greatly accelerated time-lapse video presents an extreme wide, low-angle scenery shot captured from a static camera positioned high on a mountaintop, employing deep focus to keep the entire expansive landscape and the night sky in sharp detail. Initially, the frame is almost completely dark, showing only a faint orange glow on the horizon in the bottom center and a field of stars in the top right. Suddenly, a dramatic nighttime lightning storm erupts over the vast canyon, with flashes of lightning illuminating the dark, swirling storm clouds, the canyon's rugged terrain, and what appears to be a heavy downpour. A large, dark storm cloud is lit from within by a brilliant white flash of sheet lightning, and a distinct bolt strikes down into the chasm, just left of center. The foreground is defined by the dark silhouette of a cliff edge in the bottom left. In the middle ground, the vast canyon stretches across the frame, with a steady orange light on the horizon to the right. In the background, large storm clouds fill the upper half of the frame, with a column of rain descending and the starry sky remaining in the top right. Under a partially starry sky, massive, dark storm clouds gather, periodically erupting in brilliant flashes of lightning that illuminate the deep, layered rock formations of the canyon below. A distinct column of rain is visible within the storm, and a single, sharp bolt of lightning strikes down, while a mysterious, steady orange glow persists on the distant horizon. The scene then returns to darkness, with only the distant glow and stars visible. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring power of the natural environment and the atmospheric drama of the storm itself.",

    "Motion": "This video captures a dramatic nighttime lightning storm over a vast canyon. Flashes of lightning illuminate the dark, swirling storm clouds, the canyon's rugged terrain, and what appears to be a heavy downpour. The powerful electrical display is set against a backdrop of a star-filled night sky.",
    "Scene": "At night, a vast canyon is plunged into darkness, with only a faint orange glow on the horizon and stars dotting the upper sky. Suddenly, a powerful thunderstorm erupts over the canyon, dramatically illuminating the landscape. A large, dark storm cloud is lit from within by a brilliant white flash of sheet lightning, and a distinct bolt strikes down into the chasm. The foreground is defined by the dark silhouette of a cliff edge, and a small, steady orange light remains visible on the horizon to the right of the storm.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
