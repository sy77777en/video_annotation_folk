  "merged_caption": "The scene opens from a high-angle perspective, looking down at a burning decorative piece in the middle ground on the right and a red-carpeted staircase occupying the center. The camera, from an unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, starts at this high angle and then pans left while tilting up and rolling slightly counterclockwise, transitioning to a level angle. As the camera moves, the Dutch angle becomes more pronounced before settling back to a level view. This movement reveals two figures in camouflage uniforms in the lower right half of the frame, walking away down a burning corridor in the foreground and middle ground. On the left side of the frame, another room appears equally dilapidated. Small flames are scattered across the floor, walls, and some furniture in both the corridor and the adjacent room. As the camera pans, a white text overlay reading \"Captain Price\" appears in the center-right of the frame. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping everything sharp. Bright orange flames illuminate the surrounding ruins, and the steps are covered with a red carpet featuring dark, intricate patterns. The camera pans left across a burning staircase, where flames flicker from a decorative piece and other debris. The pan reveals two figures in camouflage uniforms standing one behind the other. The video begins with an unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, initially capturing a high-angle view of a section of stairs. The camera then pans left, tilting upward and rolling slightly counterclockwise, transitioning to a level angle. This movement reveals a dilapidated indoor corridor where two individuals in camouflage uniforms are walking ahead. On the left side of the frame, part of another room is visible. Flames are scattered throughout the scene in the foreground and middle ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
