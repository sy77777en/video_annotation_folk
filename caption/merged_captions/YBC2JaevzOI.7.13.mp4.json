  "merged_caption": "This video presents a smooth, eye-level perspective of a forest scene at night, with a slight upward tilt that allows the viewer to look into the dark woods. In the foreground, several thin, bare tree trunks with gray bark are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, faintly illuminated. The ground, covered in a thick layer of dry, brown leaves, occupies the bottom of the frame and slopes gently upward from the foreground into the middle ground, receding into pitch-black darkness that obscures the deeper parts of the woods. The camera subtly tilts up, providing a faint light on the tree trunks in the foreground and the leaf-covered ground, offering a view into the depths of the dark woods. The center and upper portions of the frame are completely dark, forming the background of the scene. The scene appears to be in deep focus, though the background is too dark to be certain. There is no movement from any subjects within the frame, and there is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a quiet, eerie atmosphere, focusing on the environment itself rather than a specific object or character. The camera maintains a consistent movement throughout the clip, enhancing the immersive experience.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a natural landscape scenery shot of a dark forest at night. The foreground is dimly illuminated, showing the trunks of several bare trees rising from a ground blanketed in dead leaves. Beyond this small patch of light, the woods recede into impenetrable blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a quiet, eerie atmosphere, focusing on the environment itself rather than a specific object or character.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
