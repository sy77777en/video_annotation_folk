  "merged_caption": "This full shot frames a woman on the left and a white horse on the right, both positioned in the foreground of a sandy enclosure. The woman, with brown hair tied back, wears a blue button-up shirt, dark pants, and dark boots, and holds a lead rope attached to the reddish-brown halter worn by the white horse, which has some grey flecks on its coat. In the background, a solid wall, houses with pitched roofs, green trees, and power lines are visible against a clear sky. The woman stands near the fence and the gate, pivoting in the left-center of the frame as the horse walks in a counter-clockwise circle around her, kicking up sand with its hooves. The camera, in a slow-motion, eye-level shot, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman and the horse in the foreground. The slightly unsteady, handheld camera pans left, briefly pauses, and then continues to pan left to follow the subjects. As the horse continues its circular path, it moves from the right side of the frame into the center, completing its circular path. The enclosure is constructed from horizontal metal pipes, with a taller, solid, light-colored wall visible behind it. The ground is covered in light brown sand, and the sunny day enhances the clarity of the scene.",

    "Camera": "In this slow-motion, eye-level shot, the camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman and the white horse in the foreground. The slightly unsteady, handheld camera pans left, briefly pauses, and then pans left again to follow them.",
    "Subject": "A woman with brown hair tied back is in a sandy enclosure with a white horse. The woman wears a blue button-up shirt, dark pants, and dark boots, and she holds a lead rope. The rope is attached to the reddish-brown halter worn by the horse. The horse is white with some grey flecks on its coat and is walking in a circle around the woman.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands near the fence and the gate of a sandy enclosure, holding a lead rope attached to a white horse. The horse walks in a circle around the woman, who pivots her body to follow its movement. As the horse continues its circular path, it kicks up sand with its hooves.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor, sandy round pen on a sunny day, a woman pivots her body to follow a white horse walking in a circle around her. The enclosure is constructed from horizontal metal pipes, with a taller, solid, light-colored wall visible behind it. The ground is covered in light brown sand. In the background, residential houses with pitched roofs, green trees, and power lines are visible against a clear sky. The white horse, wearing a reddish-brown halter, moves around the woman, kicking up dust from the sandy ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
