  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of a light gray, vintage-style claw machine, centered in the foreground against a dark, featureless background. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking down from a high angle, and moves smoothly forward and downward, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field to keep all elements sharp. Inside the machine, a white, three-pronged mechanical claw initially holds a dark brown, rough-textured piece of wood in the upper-center (middle ground) of the prize area. Below it, a white stuffed rabbit with long ears is positioned in the center-left (middle ground), facing forward. Two other partially visible white stuffed animals are to the right (middle ground), with one near the lower right corner and another further to the right, near the machine's side. The claw descends and moves towards the bottom left (middle ground) of the prize area. Upon reaching this position, the claw releases its grip, allowing the wood to naturally fall into the opening at the lower left corner of the prize area, where it then disappears. The claw remains static in this bottom left position after releasing the wood. The front panel of the arcade machine, located in the bottom center (foreground), is equipped with a joystick and control buttons. The scene is characterized by a monochromatic and minimalist aesthetic, with the claw machine's large glass window providing a clear view of the interior dynamics.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a light gray, upright claw machine, characteristic of an arcade game, with a large glass window on its front. Inside the machine, a white, three-pronged mechanical claw is initially holding an elongated, dark brown, rough-textured piece of wood. Below the claw, in the prize area, sits a white stuffed rabbit with long ears, facing forward. In front and to the left of this rabbit, near the lower right corner of the claw machine, another white, rounded stuffed animal is partially visible from the back. A small portion of a third white stuffed animal can be seen further to the right, near the machine's side. The video shows the claw moving from the center of the prize area to the lower left corner before releasing the piece of wood, which then falls. The claw remains static above the opening in the lower left corner. The front panel of the claw machine features a joystick and what appear to be buttons.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a claw machine with a large glass window, containing a white mechanical claw holding a piece of wood. The claw moves towards the lower left corner of the machine. Upon reaching this position, the claw releases its grip, allowing the wood to naturally fall into the opening at the lower left corner of the prize area, where it then disappears. The claw remains stationary after releasing the wood.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a light gray, vintage-style claw machine positioned against a dark, featureless background. Through its glass front, the interior reveals a white, three-pronged claw. Initially, this claw holds a dark brown, rough-textured log, which is subsequently released. Inside the machine, a white, soft-looking stuffed bunny is almost fully visible in the upper left corner, while two other white stuffed toys are partially visible on the right side. The front panel of the arcade machine is equipped with a joystick and control buttons. The scene is characterized by a monochromatic and minimalist aesthetic.",
    "Spatial": "The video shows a medium shot of a light gray claw machine, centered in the foreground. Inside, a mechanical claw, initially holding a piece of wood, is in the upper-center (middle ground) of the prize area. A white stuffed rabbit is positioned below it in the center-left (middle ground), with two other partially visible white stuffed animals to the right (middle ground). The claw descends and moves to the bottom left (middle ground) of the prize area, releases the wood, and then remains static in this bottom left position. A joystick and buttons are on the machine's front panel in the bottom center (foreground). The camera is at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
