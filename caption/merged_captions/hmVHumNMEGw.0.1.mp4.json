  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a Black man with a shaved head, positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a light-colored paved walkway in the foreground. He is wearing a long-sleeved sweater with a black and white checkerboard pattern, featuring a black collar, cuffs, and waistband, along with blue jeans, black boots, and a set of keys hanging from the side of his pants. He is framed by two concrete pillars and a gate in the middle ground, with modern apartment buildings with glass-paneled facades visible in the background. The scene unfolds during the day in a modern urban residential area, brightly illuminated by the sun, which creates a prominent lens flare and casts long, distinct shadows across the pavement. As the man dances, swaying his body from side to side and moving his arms rhythmically, the camera arcs counterclockwise from a smooth, hip-level, and level angle around him. This movement keeps the man as the central subject while the background elements shift, and the sun, moving behind him, creates a strong backlight and a prominent lens flare that sweeps across the screen. The perspective on the man transitions from a frontal view to a profile and then a partial back view as he turns to his right, looking away from the camera, and lowers his arms, standing still. The deep focus keeps both the man and the background city environment sharp, with the middle ground featuring a gated entrance flanked by two concrete pillars, each with a sign affixed to it, and a black metal fence and manicured green hedges behind him.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level, and level angle, the camera arcs counterclockwise around a man dancing in the foreground. A deep focus keeps both the man and the background city environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "A Black man with a shaved head is shown dancing outdoors. He is wearing a long-sleeved sweater with a black and white checkerboard pattern, which features a black collar, cuffs, and waistband. He is also wearing blue jeans, black boots, and has a set of keys hanging from the side of his pants.",
    "Motion": "A man dances on a sidewalk, swaying his body from side to side and moving his arms rhythmically. He then turns to his right, looking away from the camera, and lowers his arms, standing still.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds during the day in a modern urban residential area. In the background, contemporary apartment buildings with glass-paneled facades stand behind a black metal fence and manicured green hedges. The middle ground features a light-colored paved walkway with a gated entrance flanked by two concrete pillars, each with a sign affixed to it. The scene is brightly illuminated by the sun, which creates a prominent lens flare and casts long, distinct shadows across the pavement. A person in a black-and-white checkered sweater and blue jeans dances in front of the gate as the camera moves around them.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a paved walkway in the foreground. He is framed by two concrete pillars and a gate in the middle ground, with modern buildings visible in the background. As the man dances, the camera arcs from left to right around him. This movement keeps the man as the central subject while the background elements shift, and the sun, moving behind him, creates a strong backlight and a prominent lens flare that sweeps across the screen. The perspective on the man transitions from a frontal view to a profile and then a partial back view as he turns with the camera's motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
