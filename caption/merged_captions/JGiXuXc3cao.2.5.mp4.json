  "merged_caption": "This animated scene starts with a medium close-up of a light-skinned man sitting at a desk, leaning forward, wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt and a blue baseball cap with a white triangular logo on the front. Both of his hands are on his head, clutching the cap, and his face is creased with furrowed brows and a downturned mouth as he looks down and to his right at a partially unrolled sheet of paper on the desk before him. The desk, light-brown in color, holds a few sheets of white paper. Shelving units are visible in the background on the left, containing several dark, screen-like objects, while a built-in console with various slots and panels is on the right. The overall color palette is composed of muted blues and warm browns, rendered in a hand-drawn style with prominent black outlines. The camera, positioned at the man's height, smoothly zooms out from the man while simultaneously rolling clockwise, keeping both the man and the papers in focus. The scene is set in a dimly lit room, possibly an office or control room, and the shot slowly zooms out, revealing more of the environment.",

    "Camera": "This is an animated shot of a man at a desk. The camera smoothly zooms out from the man while simultaneously rolling clockwise.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man is depicted sitting at a desk, leaning forward.

    "Motion": "The camera moves while the subject in the image remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "This 2D animated scene is set in a dimly lit room, possibly an office or control room. In the foreground, a light-brown desk holds a few sheets of white paper. The background consists of shelving units; the one on the left contains several dark, screen-like objects, while the wall on the right features a built-in console with various slots and panels. The overall color palette is composed of muted blues and warm browns, rendered in a hand-drawn style with prominent black outlines. The shot slowly zooms out.",
    "Spatial": "This animated scene starts with a medium close-up of a man and a desk with papers, both positioned in the foreground of the frame. Shelving units are visible in the background on the left, and a console is on the right. The camera, positioned at the man's height, slowly zooms out, making both the man and the papers in focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
