  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured from a slightly unsteady, bird's-eye perspective, three people are grouped in the center of the frame, positioned from the foreground to the middle ground. One person, positioned on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeved shirt and grey pants, holding the child in the middle. The second individual, being held in the middle, is dressed in a green top and white shorts, and is also wearing red socks and brown shoes. The third person, clad in a white shirt, stands on the left, appearing to support the child in the middle. The scene is presented with a black-and-white checkerboard floor filling the background. A round table is located near the group in the middle ground, and a chair is visible to the left. The camera performs a continuous crane-up movement, starting from a bird’s-eye angle from eye level, looking down at the people. As it cranes up, the perspective inverts, transitioning through an upside-down high angle and then an upside-down low angle, before ending at a worm’s-eye angle from ground level. Throughout the shot, the figures remain stationary. As the camera shifts, the round table moves to the left foreground. A wall with glass blocks and framed pictures briefly appears as the camera moves. The floor is covered in a black and white checkerboard patterned design. Visible in the scene are a light-colored, round table and a simple chair. The walls are partially visible, showing a section of glass blocks and framed pictures. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders on the left and right sides. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady shot features a continuous crane-up movement. The camera begins at a bird’s-eye angle from eye level, looking down at the people. As it cranes up, the perspective inverts, transitioning through an upside-down high angle and then an upside-down low angle, before ending at a worm’s-eye angle from ground level. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "In a scene captured from a camera craning upwards, three people are grouped in the center. One person, positioned on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeved shirt and grey pants, holding the child in the middle. The second individual, being held in the middle, is dressed in a green top and white shorts, and is also wearing red socks and brown shoes. The third person, clad in a white shirt, stands on the left, appearing to support the child in the middle.",
    "Motion": "Starting from a bird's-eye perspective, the camera cranes upwards without any rotation. As it continues this upward movement, the checkered floor of the room gradually moves out of the frame. Framed pictures on the wall briefly appear near the center of the video. A person in a red shirt and another in a white shirt hold a child dressed in green between them, remaining stationary as the perspective changes.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene is captured from a bird's-eye view, with the camera craning upward to create a disorienting effect. The floor is covered in a black and white checkerboard patterned design. Visible in the scene are a light-colored, round table and a simple chair. The walls are partially visible, showing a section of glass blocks and framed pictures. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders on the left and right sides.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
