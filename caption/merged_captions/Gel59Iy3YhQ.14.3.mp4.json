  "merged_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a video game kitchen is centrally located in the middle ground, set within a snowy village in the background. The kitchen is bisected by a vertical conveyor belt that runs down the center of the frame. Two small, cartoonish Santa characters, depicted as player characters in a winter-themed game, are positioned on opposite sides of this conveyor belt; the left character, dressed in blue, moves from the bottom-left towards the top-left of their section, while the right character, dressed in red, moves around both the bottom-right and top-right areas of their section. The characters bustle around their respective kitchen areas, with the left character moving a cup from the bottom counter to the top, filling it with a drink, and placing it on the conveyor belt. Meanwhile, the right character initially takes a drink from the bottom to the top, places it on the conveyor belt, and then returns to the bottom to add some ingredients onto the belt. The conveyor belt efficiently transports the items between the two characters, enhancing their collaborative cooking process. Game interface elements are overlaid on the scene: order tickets are at the top, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom-left corner, and a timer is in the bottom-right corner. The camera makes very subtle movements to the right and left throughout the shot, maintaining a consistent, smooth, and gentle motion, offering a peaceful, observational view of the gameplay. The scene is set in a bustling outdoor kitchen within a snowy, winter village at night, with snow-covered pine trees in the foreground and large decorative candy canes and wooden stalls with warm lights in the background, creating a festive atmosphere.",

    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a bustling outdoor kitchen set in a snowy, winter village at night. The central gameplay area is a rectangular arrangement of wooden counters surrounding two snowy patches, bisected by a moving conveyor belt that is grey with blue icy block decorations. In the foreground, there are snow-covered pine trees. In the background, large decorative candy canes, and wooden stalls with warm lights create a festive atmosphere. Two small, cartoon-like characters, both dressed as Santa Claus, move around the kitchen, interacting with ingredients and appliances. Overlays are present on the screen. At the top, a series of panels displays drink orders. A score and tip multiplier are shown in the bottom-left corner, while a countdown timer is visible in the bottom-right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
