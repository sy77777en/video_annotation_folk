  "merged_caption": "The camera moves rightward, capturing a large, out-of-focus tree trunk in the foreground on the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, a wooden post with a rope railing appears on the bottom right. The background reveals a network of elevated wooden walkways and suspension bridges stretching from the center to the right side of the frame, weaving through a dense forest of tall, slender evergreen trees. The camera is positioned at the height of the walkways, looking out from one platform. With a shallow depth of field, the camera moves smoothly to the right at a level angle, keeping the focus on the treetop walkway in the background, leaving the foreground tree trunk out of focus. The perspective is from one of these platforms, with a heavily blurred, textured tree trunk in the immediate foreground, creating a sense of depth and drawing the eye towards the distant structures weaving through the dense, green canopy. The scene is framed by a large, out-of-focus tree trunk, offering a view of the rope bridges and platforms suspended high among the tall, green trees. In the background, a network of elevated wooden walkways and suspension bridges connects the tall, straight trunks of other trees. These structures feature rope-wrapped railings and netting. A wooden post with thick rope coiled around it stands in the mid-ground. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the immersive atmosphere and impressive scale of the treetop walkway within its natural forest setting.",

    "Motion": "This video captures a treetop walkway in a lush forest, featuring a rightward camera movement. The scene is framed by a large, out-of-focus tree trunk, offering a view of the rope bridges and platforms suspended high among the tall, green trees.",
    "Scene": "From a viewpoint partially obscured by the large, out-of-focus trunk of a tree, a dense green forest is visible. In the background, a network of elevated wooden walkways and suspension bridges connects the tall, straight trunks of other trees. These structures feature rope-wrapped railings and netting. A wooden post with thick rope coiled around it stands in the mid-ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
