  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a large, kinetic light sculpture positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The sculpture's stand rests on a light-colored rectangular board at the bottom center, with black and white wires and a small black control box in the foreground at the bottom left. In the background, workshop equipment like a white bucket and coiled cables is visible on the left. The camera, filmed from a fixed, eye-level position, maintains a level angle on the spinning light sculpture, though the shot is unsteady. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp as the sculpture's multi-colored, cup-shaped lights rotate on their rods, creating a dynamic, layered pattern of spinning concentric circles. The sculpture, constructed from a single silver-colored metal ring, features curved rods that support cup-shaped lights in shades of blue, yellow, green, and red. These rods rotate around their attachment points on the ring, creating the illusion of concentric layers of colored lights moving inward. The entire apparatus is mounted on a dark, three-legged stand, which rests on the board on the floor. The dimly lit indoor workshop has a green-blue floor, and the lights illuminate the spinning components, casting a vibrant glow on the surroundings. The large, circular kinetic light sculpture remains stationary on its central stand, while dozens of small, colorful, cup-shaped elements attached to its frame revolve steadily around their individual axes. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent view as the sculpture's multi-colored, cup-shaped lights rotate on their rods, creating a dynamic, layered pattern of spinning concentric circles.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a large, kinetic light sculpture with a three-dimensional, circular form. The sculpture is constructed from a single silver-colored metal ring. Along the edge of this ring are curved rods that support cup-shaped lights in shades of blue, yellow, green, and red. These rods rotate around their attachment points on the ring, creating a dynamic, moving sculpture. The entire apparatus is mounted on a dark, three-legged stand, which rests on a light-colored rectangular board on the floor. Several black and white wires are visible on the floor, connecting to a small black box that appears to be a power supply or controller.",
    "Motion": "A large, circular kinetic light sculpture remains stationary on its central stand. Dozens of small, colorful, cup-shaped elements attached to its frame revolve steadily around their individual axes.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor workshop with a green-blue floor, a large, circular kinetic sculpture is in motion. The sculpture, mounted on a black stand, features a single, simple ring with multiple curved rods supporting cup-shaped lights. As these rods rotate, they create the illusion of concentric layers of colored lights moving inward. The lights, in blue, green, yellow, and red, illuminate the spinning components and cast a vibrant glow on the surroundings. Wires run from the base of the stand to a control box on the floor, and in the background, workshop items like a white bucket and coiled cables are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
