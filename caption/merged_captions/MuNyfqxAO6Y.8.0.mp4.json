  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, featuring a black two-door coupe parked on an asphalt surface, its body extending from the left towards the center-right of the frame, with its rear angled towards the right. The car is equipped with a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-colored wheels with a five-pointed star design and a polished outer lip. Through its tinted rear side window, a portion of an interior roll cage is visible. A sun glare is visible in the top left near the car's roof, and the car casts a long shadow across the foreground towards the bottom right, indicating a low sun angle. The asphalt surface on which the car rests occupies the bottom foreground. To the car's right, a body of water lies in the middle ground, adjacent to a field of dry, tall, reddish-brown grass that stretches from the center-right to the right edge, also in the middle ground. Further into the background, a taller field, possibly a wheat field, is discernible, while on the far left background, the eaves of houses and utility poles are visible. The upper portion of the frame is filled by a partly cloudy sky in the background. The camera is positioned at hip level with a level angle and employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where the black car and its environment remain sharp. The camera smoothly moves backward, transitioning to a full shot, causing the car to appear slightly smaller within the frame, thereby showing a little more of its immediate surroundings while its relative position and the arrangement of other elements remain consistent. On the right side of the frame, behind the asphalt road, a small stream flows from right to left, adding motion to the scene. The time of day is late afternoon or early evening, with the sun low in the sky, casting long shadows and creating a warm, hazy light through partly cloudy skies.",

    "Subject": "The video features a black two-door coupe, likely a modified sports car, parked on an asphalt surface. The car is viewed from the rear three-quarter perspective, showcasing its sleek, lowered profile. It is equipped with a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-colored wheels with a five-pointed star design and a polished outer lip. Through the tinted rear side window, a portion of an interior roll cage is visible. The car casts a long shadow to its right, indicating a low sun angle, with a bright sun glare visible near the top of the frame. In the background, a body of water is present on the right, bordered by an area of dry, tall, reddish-brown grass under a partly cloudy sky.",

On the left side of the frame, behind the tall, reddish-brown wheat field, some houses are visible, with only the eaves in view.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a black coupe parked outdoors on a paved surface next to a body of water. The time of day is late afternoon or early evening, with the sun low in the sky, casting long shadows and creating a warm, hazy light through partly cloudy skies. The car features a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-grey, star-shaped wheels with polished rims; a roll cage is visible through the windows. Behind the creek, there is a layer of shorter, reddish-brown wheat fields, and further back, a taller layer of wheat or vegetation. On the far left side of the frame, only the rooftops of some houses and utility poles are visible.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, featuring a black car in the foreground, its body extending from the left towards the center-right of the frame, with its rear angled towards the right; through its rear side window, a roll cage is partially visible within the car's interior. A sun glare is visible in the top left near the car's roof, and the car casts a shadow across the foreground towards the bottom right. The asphalt surface on which the car rests occupies the bottom foreground. To the car's right, a body of water lies in the middle ground, adjacent to a field of reddish-brown grass that stretches from the center-right to the right edge, also in the middle ground. Further into the background, a taller field is discernible, while on the far left background, the eaves of houses are visible. The upper portion of the frame is filled by a partly cloudy sky in the background. The camera maintains a position at the car's level throughout. The framing then transitions to a full shot as the camera moves backward, causing the car to appear slightly smaller within the frame, thereby showing a little more of its immediate surroundings while its relative position and the arrangement of other elements remain consistent."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
