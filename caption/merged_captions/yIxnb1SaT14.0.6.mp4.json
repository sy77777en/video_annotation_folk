  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a Parisian cityscape at night, focusing on the scenery. Initially, the illuminated Musée d'Orsay is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, with the Seine River flowing through the center and lower portions. A tree-lined promenade extends from the foreground to the background along the bottom left. Other bridges are visible in the background. The camera, positioned at a slightly elevated height, trucks from left to right while slightly panning left, causing the Musée d'Orsay to shift more towards the center-right. During this movement, numerous boats quickly pass through the frame, some moving from the foreground to the background and others from the background to the foreground on the river. The sky fills the top of the frame, and a static text overlay is present in the bottom right corner throughout the shot. The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. The camera performs a smooth, steady movement, trucking to the right along the riverbank while simultaneously panning left to keep the Musée d'Orsay prominent in the frame. The golden lights from the building and streetlights create shimmering reflections on the water's surface, set against a deep blue night sky with soft clouds. The video begins with a sweeping cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night from the left bank of the Seine River. The camera moves across the river, capturing the grand, illuminated facade of the Musée d'Orsay with its distinctive large clock, which dominates the right bank. Its warm yellow lights cast long, shimmering reflections on the dark, flowing water. Along the left bank, a tree-lined promenade is lit, while in the distance, other bridges and city lights twinkle under a deep blue, partly cloudy sky. A white text overlay is present in the bottom right corner, reading \"MATHIEU ŠTANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.",

    "Motion": "This is a beautiful nighttime scenery shot of a city, capturing a wide view of a river with a grand, illuminated building on the far bank. The golden lights from the building and streetlights create shimmering reflections on the water's surface, set against a deep blue night sky with soft clouds. The camera slowly pans along the river, while a boat glides on the water, adding a sense of gentle movement to the tranquil scene.",
    "Scene": "A nighttime view captures the Seine River in Paris, with the large, illuminated Musée d'Orsay prominent on the far bank. The historical building, distinguished by its arched windows and a large clock face, is lit with warm, yellow light, which casts long, shimmering reflections across the dark surface of the river. Along the near bank, a walkway is lined with bare trees. In the background, a bridge with arches spans the water, and a boat moves along the river. The deep blue night sky is filled with soft, moving clouds. A white text overlay is present in the bottom right corner, reading \"MATHIEU ŠTANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
