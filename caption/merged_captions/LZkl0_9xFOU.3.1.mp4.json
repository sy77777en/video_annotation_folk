  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a person's head is positioned in the left foreground, showing their short brown hair as they look at a computer monitor. The monitor occupies the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, displaying a dark interface framed by a glowing white border, featuring a central user icon with a glowing purple profile icon of a person's silhouette inside a circle, with the word \"Xenomega\" below it. A shelf is visible in the top left background. The scene is set in a dimly lit room cast in a green glow. The camera, at eye-level and level-angle, starts with a shallow depth of field focused on the computer screen. The person remains stationary while looking at the screen. The camera then pans left and performs a rack focus to the character in the foreground, revealing a side profile of a mannequin-like figure with a smooth, featureless face, shaggy, medium-length brown hair, and a light-colored t-shirt, all illuminated by a strong green light. This figure remains completely still. The camera executes a smooth, counterclockwise arc around the character while simultaneously moving backward, gradually revealing more of the surrounding environment. The mannequin-like figure is framed from the side and fills the left and center foreground. In the background, a poster is partially visible on the right, while white text is overlaid in the lower right corner, spelling out the name \"Dylan Wheeler.\"",

    "Subject": "The video opens on the back of a person's head, showing their short brown hair as they look at a computer monitor. The monitor has a dark screen with a glowing white border, displaying a user interface with a glowing purple profile icon of a person's silhouette inside a circle, with the word \"Xenomega\" below it. The view then changes to a side profile of a mannequin-like figure with a smooth, featureless face. This figure has shaggy, medium-length brown hair and is wearing a light-colored t-shirt, all illuminated by a strong green light.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a person viewed from behind, remaining stationary while looking at a computer screen. The camera then shifts to reveal the same figure from a side angle, resembling a mannequin-like figure that remains completely still.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person with brown, medium-length hair sits in a dimly lit room cast in a green glow, facing a computer monitor. The monitor displays a dark interface framed by a glowing white border, featuring a central user icon with a purple aura. In the background, a shelf and a poster are faintly visible against the wall. White text is overlaid in the lower right corner, spelling out the name \"Dylan Wheeler.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a person's head is positioned in the left foreground. A computer monitor occupies the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a shelf visible in the top left background. The camera then moves to reveal a close-up of a mannequin-like figure, which is framed from the side and fills the left and center foreground. In the background, a poster is partially visible on the right, while text appears as an overlay in the lower right corner of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
