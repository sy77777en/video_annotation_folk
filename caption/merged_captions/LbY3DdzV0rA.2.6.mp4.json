  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured as a static, time-lapse from an aerial, level-angle perspective. The scene is framed from an elevated position, looking down on two parallel highways that originate at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame and recede toward a central vanishing point in the background, creating a sense of depth. The top two-thirds of the frame are occupied by a vast expanse of dark, turbulent clouds in shades of purple and grey, swirling rapidly across the top and center of the frame as time progresses. Below the clouds, a band of intense orange and red light from the setting sun illuminates sheets of distant rain, situated centrally along the horizon in the far background. The arid terrain extends across the bottom of the frame, filling the foreground, middle ground, and background on either side of the highways. The movement of traffic on the highways is visible as long streaks of yellow light traveling from the center to the bottom left on the left highway, and red light streaks moving from the bottom right to the center on the right highway, indicating the flow of vehicles through the expansive terrain. The composition is dominated by the dramatic interplay of the storm, the sunset, and the vast, open landscape, with no single main subject, emphasizing the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. A distant mountain range is silhouetted against the horizon, adding to the dramatic scene captured at dusk. The deep focus keeps the entire landscape sharp and clear, highlighting the dynamic motion of the clouds and the light trails from passing cars as the time-lapse progresses.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video shot from an aerial, level-angle perspective. A deep focus keeps the entire landscape sharp and clear, with highways starting in the foreground and stretching into the background, creating a sense of depth against the dramatic storm clouds and distant mountains.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, captured as a time-lapse. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, purplish-gray storm clouds that loom over the scene. In stark contrast, the horizon glows with a fiery orange and red light from a setting sun, illuminating sheets of distant rain falling from the cloud base. A multi-lane highway stretches from the foreground into the vanishing point, with the movement of vehicles captured as continuous streaks of white and red light, indicating the flow of traffic through the expansive, arid terrain. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, emphasizing the dramatic interplay of the storm, the sunset, and the vast, open landscape.",
    "Motion": "This time-lapse video showcases a dramatic storm brewing over a highway at sunset. Dark, turbulent clouds dominate the sky, while the horizon is set ablaze with a fiery orange and red glow, illuminating sheets of falling rain. The motion of the clouds and the light trails from passing cars are visible as time progresses.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a dramatic scene over a vast, open landscape at dusk. Two parallel highways with white lane markings stretch toward a distant mountain range silhouetted against the horizon. The sky is filled with dark, turbulent storm clouds in shades of purple and grey. Below the clouds, a band of intense orange and red light from the sunset illuminates sheets of falling rain in the distance. The movement of traffic on the highways is visible as long streaks of yellow and red light, while the clouds swirl rapidly overhead.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
