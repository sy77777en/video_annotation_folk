  "merged_caption": "A leopard with a yellowish-tan coat patterned with black rosettes and spots is initially partially visible in the center-left middle ground, obscured by several thick, grey tree trunks. The large cat, with long, white whiskers and amber eyes, emerges from behind the trunks, its face scrunched, nose wrinkled, and teeth bared. It moves from left to right across the frame, walking forward with a steady gait through the dry, leafy undergrowth and around scattered rocks. The ground is covered in a layer of brown, dry leaves, twigs, and a small amount of green foliage near the base of the trees. The camera, positioned at the subject's level and using a shallow depth of field, focuses on the leopard in the midground. As the leopard continues to walk deliberately through the uneven, leafy terrain, the slightly unsteady camera pans to the right, tracking the leopard's movement. Additional tree trunks are positioned in the foreground, middle ground, and background, enhancing the depth of the scene. The camera maintains a medium shot of the leopard as it moves through the middle ground, capturing the dynamics of the scene from a level, hip-height perspective.",

    "Camera": "From a level, hip-height perspective, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the leopard in the midground. The slightly unsteady camera pans to the right, tracking the leopard as it moves through the undergrowth.",
    "Subject": "A leopard with a yellowish-tan coat patterned with black rosettes and spots emerges from behind a thick tree trunk. The large cat has long, white whiskers and amber eyes. As it first appears, its face is scrunched, with its nose wrinkled and its teeth bared. It then walks forward with a steady gait, moving through the dry, leafy undergrowth.",
    "Motion": "A leopard emerges from behind multiple tree trunks with a scrunched facial expression, baring its teeth. It then walks forward with a steady gait, moving from left to right through the dry, leafy undergrowth and around rocks.",
    "Scene": "In a dry, wooded area, a leopard with a spotted coat emerges from behind the thick, grey trunks of several trees. The ground is covered in a layer of brown, dry leaves, twigs, and scattered rocks. A small amount of green foliage is visible near the base of the trees. The leopard steps forward, briefly scrunching its face and baring its teeth, before continuing to walk deliberately through the undergrowth and across the uneven, leafy terrain.",
    "Spatial": "A leopard is initially partially visible in the center-left middle ground, obscured by several tree trunks. It emerges, moving from left to right across the frame. The camera trucks to the right, maintaining a medium shot of the leopard as it walks through the middle ground, which is covered in dry leaves and rocks. Additional tree trunks are positioned in the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
