  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, focusing on the scenery. A dark, silhouetted landscape extends from the foreground to the background along the bottom of the static frame. The middle ground and background are dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds that fills most of the scene. A particularly dense, dark cloud mass occupies the left and center of the frame. Intermittent flashes of lightning occur in the background, partially obscured by the dark cloud mass. A brighter area of the sky glows mostly in the upper and right side of the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the vast expanse of the storm. This is a static, time-lapse shot of a stormy sky. Due to the lack of background information, it is difficult to determine the exact height of the camera, but it is looking up at the clouds in a low angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video features a static shot of a dramatic skyscape, dominated by a massive, dark storm cloud under a purple sky. Flashes of lightning illuminate the turbulent clouds from within, and the cloud mass shifts subtly, adding dynamic movement to the atmospheric scenery. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of storm clouds, tinged with deep purple and violet hues. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the clouds from within, revealing their complex, layered structure, while a brighter, pinkish glow emanates from the horizon, creating a stark contrast with the dark, ominous cloud mass that looms over a silhouetted landscape. A dramatic thunderstorm unfolds at dusk over a silhouetted landscape. The sky is dominated by massive, dark purple storm clouds that swirl and layer upon each other.",

    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at dusk or dawn.

    "Scene": "A dramatic thunderstorm unfolds at dusk over a silhouetted landscape. The sky is dominated by massive, dark purple storm clouds that swirl and layer upon each other. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the clouds from within, casting a lavender glow across the turbulent sky. The ground below remains a dark, undefined silhouette against the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
