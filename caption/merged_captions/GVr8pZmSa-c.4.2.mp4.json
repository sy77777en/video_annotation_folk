  "merged_caption": "A full shot, filmed from above, shows a corroded, ancient-looking artifact positioned in the center of the frame, resting in the foreground on a dark brown wooden surface. The object is roughly square-shaped with irregular, broken edges and is covered in a thick, uneven patina of greenish patina, characteristic of oxidized copper or bronze, and patches of reddish-brown rust. Despite the corrosion, raised patterns are visible, including a central circular design that contains what appears to be a stylized face or symbol. The camera focuses on the artifact, utilizing a shallow depth of field, and steadily moves downward to approach it while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise. A black line then materializes, running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right across the center of the artifact. The artifact subsequently splits cleanly into two distinct pieces along this line, with both halves remaining in their original central position, separating slightly.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera focuses on a rusty bronze artifact on a wooden table, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The camera steadily moves downward to approach the artifact while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise.",
    "Subject": "A corroded, ancient-looking artifact is shown against a dark surface. The object is roughly square-shaped with irregular, broken edges. Its surface is heavily textured with a greenish patina, characteristic of oxidized copper or bronze, and patches of reddish-brown rust. Despite the corrosion, raised patterns are visible, including a central circular design that contains what appears to be a stylized face or symbol. During the video, a clean, black line appears diagonally across the artifact, and it splits into two distinct pieces along this line, suggesting it has broken.",
    "Motion": "An ancient, corroded artifact rests motionless on a dark surface. A black line materializes diagonally across its face, and the artifact then splits into two distinct pieces along this line, separating slightly.",
    "Scene": "An ancient, corroded metal artifact rests on a dark brown wooden surface. The object is roughly square with irregular edges and is covered in a thick, uneven patina of green and reddish-brown. A faint, embossed circular design is visible on its surface. The artifact splits cleanly into two distinct pieces along a line that runs diagonally across it.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot, filmed from above, shows a corroded artifact positioned in the center of the frame, resting in the foreground on a dark surface. A black line then appears, running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right across the center of the artifact.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
