  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a dark-skinned, bald man wearing a blue athletic tank top with \"USA\" printed on the front and matching blue athletic shorts is initially sitting in the center-right foreground on a red block with \"MONDO\" printed in white, located in the bottom right. He holds a pink and orange baton in his hands, consistently facing the left side of the scene. In the top right, the arm and hand of a light-skinned person wearing a white short-sleeved shirt are partially visible in the middle ground. A large blue, dotted digital screen spans the middle ground behind the man, displaying the white text \"I MOVE,\" with gray structural framework and black cables visible in the background at the top of the frame. As the man stands up, moving upward and slightly to the left within the frame, the camera performs a quick, slightly unsteady pan to the left, followed by a tilt upward to track his head. This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus to capture the scene's dynamics and environment.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in an indoor athletic venue, characterized by a large, blue, dotted digital screen in the background that displays the white text \"I MOVE.\" Above the screen, gray structural framework and black cables are visible. In the foreground, a man in a blue athletic uniform sits on a red block with \"MONDO\" printed in white, holding a pink baton. He subsequently stands up, facing slightly to the left, with his body oriented sideways toward the camera.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
