  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young, light-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a green hooded sweatshirt and a light-colored baseball cap, positioned in the foreground of a modern kitchen. The kitchen is illuminated by warm, artificial light and features white cabinetry, marble countertops, and a large, stainless steel, double-door refrigerator visible in the left middle ground. A kitchen counter occupies the right foreground. The man picks up a red and silver soda can from the counter, brings it to his lips, and takes a drink. As he leans forward over the counter and covers his mouth with both hands, the camera, filmed from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, moves forward and pans slightly to the right, reframing the scene into a medium close-up. In this tighter shot, the man remains in the center but is now in the foreground, while the refrigerator on the left is out of the frame. A doorway in the right background becomes more prominent, revealing another dimly lit room of the house. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire kitchen sharp, and tracks the man's movement across the room. The space is characterized by a gas stovetop beneath a matching range hood and a central island with a sink occupying the foreground. The kitchen table is cluttered with numerous utensils, adding a touch of lived-in realism to the otherwise sleek and modern aesthetic. As the man leans on the table, the camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the doorway in the right background becomes more prominent, revealing another room in darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
