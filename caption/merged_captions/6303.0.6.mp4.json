  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a smartphone held by a person with medium to dark skin tone, centrally positioned in the frame with the person's hands in the foreground. The hands, adorned with long, pink manicured nails and a large translucent orange ring, interact with the phone using the index finger. The phone screen displays three different app interfaces sequentially. Initially, the interface \"Space Vibes\" is shown with cartoon planets. The person swipes left, changing the screen to a pink-themed interface labeled \"Love Songs\" with flowers and hearts, and then swipes again to reveal \"Hair Grooves\" with an image of hair and scissors. The tiled floor with a checkerboard pattern is visible in the background, providing a contrasting backdrop. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down at the phone held in the hands. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout the video. The setting is indoors, with an evenly lit environment suggesting artificial light. The main visual element is the smartphone, displaying vibrant graphics on the screen. The character's hands remain central to the video, emphasizing their interaction with the phone. The setting is minimal, focusing on the interaction with the device, with no additional furniture or props visible.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors with a tiled floor featuring a checkerboard pattern of dark and light squares. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit environment, possibly under artificial light. The main visual element is a smartphone held in the character's hands, displaying vibrant graphics on the screen. The phone's screen shows colorful, playful designs with text and icons, including planets and scissors, against dark backgrounds. The character's hands, adorned with rings and painted nails, interact with the phone, suggesting engagement with the content displayed. The setting is minimal, focusing on the interaction with the device, with no additional furniture or props visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
