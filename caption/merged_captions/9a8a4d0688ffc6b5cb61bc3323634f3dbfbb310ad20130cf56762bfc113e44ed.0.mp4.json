  "merged_caption": "This medium shot opens with the back of a curly-haired person with a backpack positioned in the left-center foreground, wearing a rust-colored jacket and a brown leather backpack with crisscrossing straps. In the right-center middle ground, a man with dark hair and a short beard, dressed in a white shirt, a dark jacket, and dark gray pants, walks toward the camera along a well-lit hallway with white walls and a reflective, light-colored floor, while looking down at an open book he holds in his hands. A large, rectangular black-and-white abstract painting is displayed on the left wall in the middle ground, and at the far end of the corridor, a set of double doors with glass panels reveals daylight from outside. As the shot progresses, the curly-haired person walks away from the camera into the middle ground. A second person with long, straight dark hair, wearing a black jacket and carrying a white patterned tote bag, enters from the bottom-left foreground and also walks away, remaining on the left side of the frame. The man continues to approach in the middle ground, moving into the space until he is initially framed to the right of the two figures walking away and finally between them. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a static, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field. The focus is held on the man walking in the midground, leaving the pair of women in the foreground out of focus. In the middle of the corridor, there is a doorway without doors, with a green exit sign visible above the doorframe. The man is positioned further behind the two people who have their backs to the camera as they all walk in the same general area.",

    "Subject": "The video features three people in a hallway. In the foreground, a person with voluminous, light-brown curly hair is seen from behind, wearing a rust-colored jacket and a brown leather backpack with crisscrossing straps. Walking towards them in the middle ground is a man with dark hair and a short beard, dressed in a white shirt, a dark jacket, and dark gray pants; he is looking down at an open book he holds in his hands. A third person with long, straight dark hair, wearing a black jacket and carrying a white patterned tote bag, enters from the left and is also seen from behind. The man is positioned further behind the two people who have their backs to the camera as they all walk in the same general area.",
    "Motion": "A person with curly hair and a backpack walks away from the camera down a hallway. Simultaneously, a man walks toward the camera from the opposite direction while looking down at an open book. A third person with long dark hair enters from the left and walks down the hallway, moving past the person with curly hair.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a well-lit hallway with white walls and a reflective, light-colored floor. On the left wall, a large, rectangular black-and-white abstract painting is displayed. In the middle of the corridor, there is a doorway without doors, with a green exit sign visible above the doorframe. At the far end of the corridor, a set of double doors with glass panels reveals daylight from outside. People are walking through the hall; two women, one wearing a brown leather backpack and the other carrying a white bag, are seen from behind walking away, while a man in a dark jacket walks toward the viewer, reading an open book.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot opens with the back of a curly-haired person with a backpack positioned in the left-center foreground.

As the shot progresses, the curly-haired person walks away from the camera into the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
