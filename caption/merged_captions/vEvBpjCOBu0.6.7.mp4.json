  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up, out-of-focus shot of a clear glass tumbler positioned in the center of the frame. The camera, from a level-angle perspective, smoothly dollies backward while slightly rolling counterclockwise, transitioning to a medium shot and bringing the glass into sharp focus. As the camera continues to move backward, the entire stationary glass is revealed, flanked by two out-of-focus figures in white, full-body protective suits with hoods pulled up, standing still on either side of the glass. Their faces are obscured by blue masks, and only their upper torsos and heads are visible. The glass remains in the center of the foreground, with the figures situated in the middle ground against a solid black background. The scene is brightly lit, causing reflections on the glass, which rests on a textured silver surface. The glass is cylindrical with a wider mouth and a slight curve near its base, reflecting distorted vertical white shapes. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\". The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the glass in sharp focus as the full scene is revealed.",

    "Subject": "An empty, clear glass tumbler stands in the center, positioned between two people. The glass is cylindrical with a wider mouth and a slight curve near its base, and it reflects distorted vertical white shapes. Flanking the glass are two individuals, one on the left and one on the right, both wearing white, full-body protective suits with the hoods pulled up. Their faces are obscured by blue masks. Only the upper torsos and heads of the two figures are visible.",
    "Motion": "The camera pulls back from a blurry close-up of a clear glass tumbler, bringing the entire stationary glass into focus. As the camera continues to move backward, two figures in white protective suits are revealed, standing still on either side of the glass.",
    "Scene": "In a setting with a solid black background, a clear, empty drinking glass rests on a textured silver surface. The camera pulls back from a blurry close-up to reveal the full glass, which is flanked by two out-of-focus figures wearing white, full-body protective suits. The scene is brightly lit, causing reflections on the glass. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\".",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an extreme close-up, out-of-focus shot of a clear glass tumbler positioned in the center of the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a medium shot and bringing the glass into sharp focus. In the final framing, the glass remains in the center of the foreground, flanked by two out-of-focus figures in white protective suits. One figure is on the left and the other is on the right, both situated in the middle ground against a solid black background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
