  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot featuring two smartphones and a pair of hands. The second smartphone is positioned near the center of the frame, slightly to the right, displaying a world clock with times for Cupertino and New York, while the first smartphone is on the left, showing a digital clock with the time 11:46 and a date, set against a gold and blue background. Both smartphones are in the background and equidistant from the viewer. The hands, with a light skin tone, are positioned centrally in the frame, manipulating a transparent screen protector over the second smartphone. The right hand holds a tool, and the left hand wears a ring. The screen protector, initially intact, is bent, revealing a cracked pattern. Various colorful objects, including pen-like screwdrivers, a lighter, and other items, are scattered around the edges of the frame, primarily in the background, adding to the casual, everyday setting. The camera is shot from a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the subject, employing deep focus to ensure all elements are sharp and clear. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking, providing a clear overhead POV view of the actions taking place. The video demonstrates how bending a screen protector results in a cracked pattern. As the hands bend the screen protector, it visibly cracks, and when unfolded, the extent of the damage is clearly emphasized. The environment is indoors, with bright lighting providing clear visibility of the objects and actions within the scene. The tabletop is cluttered, enhancing the casual atmosphere. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the sequence.",

    "Subject": "The video features two smartphones and a pair of hands.

The hands, with a light skin tone, are manipulating a transparent screen protector over the second smartphone. The person is wearing a ring on the left hand and holding a tool in the right hand. The screen protector, which was already removed at the beginning of the video, is being bent, causing it to reveal a cracked pattern.",
    "Motion": "The video demonstrates how bending a screen protector results in a cracked pattern. Two smartphones are positioned side by side beneath the hands, with one displaying a world clock. As the hands bend the screen protector, it visibly cracks, and when unfolded, the extent of the damage is clearly emphasized.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an overhead POV shot, capturing a close-up view of a tabletop setting. The environment is indoors, with a focus on two smartphones placed on a flat surface. The time of day is indicated by the phone screens, showing a digital clock display. One phone shows a date and time, while the other displays a world clock with different time zones. The scene includes a pair of hands interacting with a transparent, flexible material, possibly a screen protector, which is being manipulated above one of the phones. The tabletop is cluttered with various colorful objects, including multiple pen-like screwdrivers, a lighter, and other items, adding to the casual, everyday setting. The lighting is bright, providing clear visibility of the objects and actions within the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
