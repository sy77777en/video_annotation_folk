  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a large group of elephants in a shallow river, with the camera positioned above them at an overhead level (around second-floor height) and angled high, looking down on the scene. The elephants, varying in size and shades of greyish-brown, are distributed across the frame, primarily occupying the middle and bottom sections, with some extending into the foreground. Their skin is predominantly gray with some areas appearing darker due to harsh shadows from the strong sunlight. The upper middle section features the flowing river and rocky riverbank, with green vegetation visible at the top of the frame in the distance, forming the background. The elephants stand and wade in the shallow water, occasionally moving their trunks to drink or splash water onto themselves. Some elephants shift their weight or take a few steps forward, while others remain stationary. The group maintains a relaxed posture, with ears flapping back and forth and trunks either lowered or slightly raised. All the elephants are facing the same direction, towards the left side of the frame, suggesting a coordinated activity such as drinking or bathing. The river is characterized by numerous large, smooth, light-colored rocks, both submerged and exposed, forming the riverbed and banks. The elephants vary in size, indicating a mix of adults and juveniles, and their positioning creates a dynamic composition as they wade through the water. The camera maintains a static position with a deep focus and a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp, capturing the scene from an elevated perspective. The scene conveys a sense of a natural gathering in a serene setting.",

    "Scene": "The video captures a herd of elephants wading in a wide, shallow river during the daytime. The elephants, varying in size and shades of greyish-brown, some with patches of reddish-brown dust on their backs, are dispersed throughout the flowing water. The river is characterized by numerous large, smooth, light-colored rocks, both submerged and exposed, forming the riverbed and banks. Green vegetation is visible on the far bank.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
