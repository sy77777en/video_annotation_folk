  "merged_caption": "A wide shot shows a Black man with a bald head and a light goatee standing in the middle ground on the right side of a stage, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience are visible at the bottom of the frame, seated and mostly still, facing the stage. Behind the man, in the background, a large \"TEDxRyersonU\" sign spans the width of the stage, with stylized cutouts of a city skyline illuminated with blue light against a black backdrop. The stage is lit, while the audience remains in darkness. The man gestures with his hands as he speaks, taking a few steps to his right, continuing to gesture and talk. He then stops, turns to face the audience, and raises both hands with his palms facing forward. After a moment, he lowers his arms, briefly places his hands on his hips, and then walks to his right toward the edge of the frame, which is the left edge, stopping with only half of his body visible. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep both the speaker on stage and the audience in the foreground sharp and clear.",

    "Scene": "The scene is an indoor auditorium during a presentation. A man in a light-colored shirt and dark pants stands on a wooden stage, speaking to an audience. Behind him, a large sign reads \"TEDxRyersonU\" in bold red and white letters. Further in the background, stylized cutouts of a city skyline are illuminated with blue light against a black backdrop. The stage is lit, while the audience in the foreground is seated in darkness, their figures appearing as silhouettes. The man gestures with his hands as he addresses the crowd.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
