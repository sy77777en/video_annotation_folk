  "merged_caption": "In a full shot of the subject, a green glass bottle is positioned in the center foreground, tilted slightly. Inside the bottle, a 2D animated brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and whiskers is initially located in the bottom center of the frame, submerged in a bubbly green liquid. The mouse, Jerry, first appears with his cheeks puffed out as if holding his breath. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, uses a low-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on Jerry inside the bottle. As the scene progresses, Jerry transitions to a surprised expression with wide eyes and an open mouth, bobbing slightly within the liquid and floating slightly upward and toward the center. The camera remains static initially, capturing the effervescence around Jerry, and towards the end of the video, it executes a smooth, minor pan from right to left. The background is a softly lit, out-of-focus interior room, where a window with curtains is visible on the left, and a glowing wall sconce is on the right, suggesting an evening setting. The combination of the flat, cartoon character within the three-dimensional, textured environment of the bottle presents an atypical visual.",

    "Subject": "A 2D animated brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and whiskers is depicted inside a realistic, green glass bottle. The bottle is filled with a bubbly, green liquid, and its inner surface is covered in condensation. The mouse is shown submerged within the liquid, first with his cheeks puffed out as if holding his breath, and then with a surprised expression featuring wide eyes and an open mouth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
