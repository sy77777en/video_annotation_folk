  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person with light skin, wearing a red shirt, holds a yellow and black chainsaw horizontally by its black handle, occupying the foreground from the left side of the frame to the right. The chainsaw features a \"POWER 50cc\" sticker on its yellow motor housing and a long, black bar with a visible chain. A translucent water balloon, containing a smaller purple balloon, enters from the top center and descends vertically toward the middle of the chainsaw's bar. The video is filmed with a static, hip-level shot using a level angle and a shallow depth of field, keeping the chainsaw in sharp focus against a blurred background of green foliage. As the balloon descends, the video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. Upon impact with the moving chain, the outer balloon bursts in slow motion, sending a spray of clear water outward. The inner purple balloon is then shredded by the chain, releasing a vibrant cloud of green liquid that mixes with the water, creating a colorful splash that expands outward from the center of the frame. Torn pieces of the balloon are flung away, while the camera remains stationary, capturing the dynamic interaction in detail.",

    "Subject": "A person with light skin, wearing a red shirt, holds a yellow and black chainsaw horizontally by its black handle. The chainsaw has a \"POWER 50cc\" sticker on its yellow motor housing and a long, black bar with a visible chain. A translucent, spherical water balloon, which contains a smaller, inner purple balloon, falls onto the moving chain of the saw. Upon impact, the outer balloon bursts in slow motion, sending a spray of clear water outward. The inner purple balloon is then shredded by the chain, releasing a vibrant cloud of green liquid that mixes with the water as torn pieces of the balloon are flung away.",
    "Motion": "A translucent water balloon, containing a smaller purple balloon, falls onto the moving chain of a horizontally held chainsaw. In slow motion, the outer balloon bursts upon impact, spraying clear water outward. The inner purple balloon is then shredded by the chain, releasing a vibrant cloud of green liquid that mixes with the water as torn pieces of the balloon are flung away.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting with a blurred background of green foliage, a person holds a yellow and black chainsaw horizontally. A translucent balloon containing a smaller purple balloon inside descends onto the chainsaw's moving blade. Upon impact, the balloon bursts in slow motion, initially spraying clear water. This is immediately followed by an eruption of green liquid that mixes with the water, creating a colorful splash that expands outward from the point of contact on the blade.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a chainsaw is held horizontally, occupying the foreground from the left side of the frame to the right. A translucent water balloon, containing a smaller purple balloon, enters from the top center and descends vertically toward the middle of the chainsaw's bar. Upon impact, the balloon bursts in slow motion, sending a spray of clear water and a cloud of green liquid expanding outward from the center of the frame, while torn pieces of the balloon are flung away. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
