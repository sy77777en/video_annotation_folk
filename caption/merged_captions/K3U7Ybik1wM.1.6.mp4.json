  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the shot is initially directed downwards, capturing a pair of bare feet in the bottom-center middle ground as they walk across a flagstone floor that fills the entire frame. The person, with light skin, is wearing the lower portion of loose-fitting blue pants and the hem of a white shirt. The camera, initially using a bird's-eye, top-down angle, moves forward, following the movement while maintaining this downward view. As the person continues walking barefoot across the patio made of large, irregularly shaped flagstones in shades of tan and gray, the camera tilts up to a level angle, causing the stone patio to recede to the bottom of the frame, now serving as the foreground. This tilt reveals a large green lawn occupying the middle ground, enclosed by a wooden fence. In the background, a rural landscape with trees and a cloudy sky extends into the distance. The camera then pans slightly to the left. The entire video is distorted by a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, which makes the camera's focus unclear.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, the camera begins with a bird's-eye view, looking down at a person's bare feet walking on a stone patio. As the person continues walking forward, the camera tilts up to a level angle, revealing a grassy field, and then pans slightly to the left. The entire video is distorted by a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, which makes the camera's focus unclear.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin walks barefoot. The view is directed downwards, showing their feet, the lower portion of their loose-fitting blue pants, and the hem of a white shirt. They are walking across a patio made of large, irregularly shaped flagstones in shades of tan and gray. The camera follows their movement and then tilts up to reveal a large, green lawn bordered by a wooden fence.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person walks barefoot across a flagstone patio. The camera follows their forward movement and then tilts upward to reveal a large, green lawn bordered by a wooden fence.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, follows a barefoot person wearing blue jeans walking across a rustic floor of large, uneven flagstones. The camera moves forward, transitioning from an indoor space onto an outdoor stone patio. It then tilts upward to reveal a large, vibrant green lawn enclosed by a wooden fence, with a rural landscape and trees visible under a cloudy sky.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, the shot is initially directed downwards, capturing a pair of bare feet in the bottom-center middle ground as they walk across a flagstone floor that fills the entire frame. The camera, initially using a bird's-eye, top-down angle, moves forward, following the movement while maintaining this downward view. It then smoothly tilts upward to a level angle, causing the stone patio to recede to the bottom of the frame, now serving as the foreground. This tilt reveals a large green lawn occupying the middle ground, enclosed by a wooden fence. In the background, a rural landscape with trees and a cloudy sky extends into the distance."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
