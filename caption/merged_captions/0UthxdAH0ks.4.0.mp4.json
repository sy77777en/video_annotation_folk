  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium-long shot capturing the reflection of a hunched person, positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. In the background center, a vertical strip of white light illuminates a wall section featuring a wire hanger and a small shelf. A large, dark silhouette dominates the right foreground. The camera, positioned at hip level with a level angle, maintains deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. It pans slightly right, revealing more of the room, including a hanger on the wall and some objects on a shelf. As the camera continues to move, the person becomes visible, hunched over and pressing their hands against a table. The person then begins to straighten up, moving from a hunched position to a more upright stance. The camera pauses briefly, then resumes panning right while tilting slightly upward towards the end of the clip, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and shaking. The transition to a medium shot captures the person bent over with their arms braced on the table, attempting to straighten up, now located in the middle ground towards the right side of the frame. Red curtains cover the balcony window in the background right, near a circular drying rack. A dark silhouette now occupies the left foreground. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains a hip-level position with the subject, and after the camera pans to the right, the angle shifts to a slightly downward perspective. The room is dimly lit with a red hue, and soft daylight filters through the curtains, tinting the incoming light with a subtle red hue, creating a dark atmosphere. The low lighting obscures detailed features, rendering the person largely as a silhouette.",

    "Subject": "In the video, a person is depicted in a dimly lit room with prominent red lighting. Initially, the person is seen mostly as a reflection in the mirror, hunched over. The view then pans to show the person's upper body directly, with their hands resting on a table as if attempting to stand up. The low lighting obscures detailed features, rendering the person largely as a silhouette.",
    "Motion": "The scene is set in a dimly lit room with a red hue, where a person is initially seen as a reflection on a surface, hunched over. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the room, including a hanger on the wall and some objects on a shelf. As the camera continues to move, the person becomes visible, hunched over and pressing his hands against a table. The person then begins to straighten up, moving from a hunched position to a more upright stance.",
    "Scene": "The video captures the interior of a room where soft daylight filters through the curtains, tinting the incoming light with a subtle red hue, creating a dark atmosphere. A single, vertical strip of white light cuts through the dimness, illuminating a section of a wall where a wire clothes hanger hangs and a small shelf holds indistinct items. In the background, red curtains cover the balcony window, a  circular clothes hanger is also attached to the clothesline is also attached to the clothesline. Silhouetted figure and the objects on the table beside him occupy the foreground and midground, contributing to the sparsely furnished appearance of the space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
