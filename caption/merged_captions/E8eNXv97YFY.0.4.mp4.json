  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a large, open-air stadium from a high vantage point within the stands. The foreground is composed of empty, tiered concrete stands that occupy the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a vibrant green grass field sits in the center, encircled by a grey running track on the inside and a reddish-brown running track on the outside. A few small figures are visible on the central field. The main grandstand with a brown-colored roof appears in the upper part of the frame, while tall light poles are positioned around the stadium. The background features a city skyline stretching across the upper portion of the frame, set against a partly cloudy sky with scattered white and grey clouds. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and performs a slightly unsteady clockwise arc around the stadium, capturing the expansive, tiered concrete stands that are largely empty. The video lacks a main subject, as the perspective emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the venue itself rather than any specific activity or individual within it. The time-lapse video shows slight movements of people within the stadium, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene. The city skyline remains visible in the background throughout the video, providing a consistent backdrop to the changing activity on the field.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a stadium, shot from an overhead, level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It performs a slightly unsteady clockwise arc around the stadium.",
    "Subject": "This is an extreme wide cityscape scenery shot of a large, open-air stadium. A vibrant green grass field, where a few small figures can be seen, is encircled by a reddish-brown and grey running track. The expansive, tiered concrete stands are largely empty, with one section covered by a prominent roof structure, and the city skyline is visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky. The video lacks a main subject, as the perspective emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the venue itself rather than any specific activity or individual within it.",
    "Motion": "This is an extreme wide shot of a large sports stadium. The view looks down onto a green field, a running track, and tiered concrete stands. A city skyline is visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky, and the camera performs a slightly unsteady clockwise arc around the stadium. There are slight movements of people within the stadium.",
    "Scene": "From an overhead level, level angle perspective, the scene captures a large, outdoor stadium during the day. A central, vibrant green grass field is surrounded by a grey concrete running track and a reddish-brown running track. The stadium's seating consists of weathered, tiered concrete stands that encircle the track. A main grandstand with a brown-colored roof stands out. The foreground shows the empty, stepped concrete of the stands. Tall light poles are positioned around the stadium, and in the distance, a city skyline is visible beneath a sky with scattered white and grey clouds. A few small figures can be seen on the grass field.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
