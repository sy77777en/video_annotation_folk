  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centrally frames a woman's face, which occupies the foreground of the scene. The camera is positioned at her eye level, maintaining a direct and steady view. The entire scene is bathed in a strong, saturated red light, creating a monochromatic effect. Her face remains mostly still, looking directly forward with a neutral expression. Her eyes are wide open, revealing large, dark pupils that make her eyes appear almost entirely black. The camera maintains an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on her face. Throughout the shot, her face remains fixed in the center of the frame but undergoes a very slow and subtle morphing transition, with her features gradually dissolving and reforming into those of another person. During this transformation, a dark mark, resembling a tear or a scratch, gradually appears on her left cheek. She briefly speaks during the video.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot taken from a level angle. The camera maintains an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the woman's face in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A close-up shot shows the face of a woman with pale skin and shoulder-length, wavy, light-colored hair, looking directly forward with a neutral expression. Her eyes are wide open, revealing large, dark pupils that make her eyes appear almost entirely black. The entire scene is bathed in a strong, saturated red light. Throughout the video, her face subtly morphs, and a dark mark, resembling a tear or a scratch, appears on her left cheek.",
    "Motion": "A woman's face remains mostly still, looking directly forward. Over the course of the video, her facial features undergo a slow, subtle morphing transition, while a dark, tear-like mark gradually appears on her left cheek. She briefly speaks during the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, indistinct setting, a person's face is shown in a tight close-up, bathed entirely in a saturated, monochromatic red light. The individual has long, wavy hair and wide-open eyes with dark pupils, staring directly forward with a neutral expression. A subtle and slow visual transition occurs as the features of the face almost imperceptibly morph into the likeness of another person.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot centrally frames a woman's face, which occupies the foreground of the scene. The camera is positioned at her eye level, maintaining a direct and steady view. Throughout the shot, her face remains fixed in the center of the frame but undergoes a very slow and subtle morphing transition, with her features gradually dissolving and reforming into those of another person. During this transformation, a dark mark also materializes on her left cheek."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
