  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, focusing on the upper part of a dilapidated multi-story building with a cylindrical corner tower. The building occupies most of the frame, extending from the left side towards the right, with only its upper portion visible. The cylindrical tower is positioned in the foreground on the left, while the main body of the building stretches into the foreground towards the right. The tattered construction wrap and fire escape stairs are prominently displayed across the facade, with the wrap covering parts of the building in the middle and left sections. The sky forms the background, appearing overcast and casting a muted, greenish hue over the scene. The camera features a low-angle view with deep focus, capturing a large depth of field. It moves forward while tilting up, maintaining smooth and steady motion, gradually providing a clearer view of the construction materials and the state of the building's exterior. The plastic sheets are fluttering in the wind, emphasizing the building's renovation status. The emphasis is on the overall mood and texture of the cityscape, highlighting the urban setting and architectural details rather than a specific object. The environment appears still, with no visible movement or activity, except for the fluttering sheets. The entire building remains in the foreground, with no part in the middle ground, and the camera maintains a consistent perspective from within the building's height range, emphasizing its verticality and architectural details. The structure is partially covered in tattered construction wrap and has visible fire escape stairs, with the facade showing signs of wear, such as peeling materials. The overcast sky casts a muted, greenish hue over the scene, suggesting a cloudy day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
