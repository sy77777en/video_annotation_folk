  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in a wide, high-angle shot, looking down upon a central kitchen float positioned in the middle ground and center of the frame. Two small, cartoonish chef characters, both wearing pink hats and white aprons, are on the float; one is dressed in a red outfit and moves around the left side of a central moving platform, while the other, in blue, moves around the right side. The chefs move back and forth on their respective sides, picking up and preparing ingredients, and interacting with cooking stations as the entire kitchen assembly travels to the left along the road. A user interface is overlaid on the screen, with order tickets spanning the top center and left of the frame, depicting items like hot dogs and sundaes with icons for their specific ingredients. A score of 532 and a tip multiplier are shown in the bottom-left corner, while a countdown timer is in the bottom-right. The float is surrounded by a vibrant, outdoor street festival in the middle ground and background, with a customer counter at the top of the frame. The paved ground is scattered with confetti, and the area is decorated with blue and yellow balloons and palm trees, creating a tropical ambiance. A large plant leaf occupies the bottom-left corner. Throughout the shot, the central platform moves, and the chefs actively navigate their respective sections of the float. The camera provides a high-angle, aerial-level view of the video game action, smoothly moving to the left, keeping the central kitchen area in the frame. The entire scene remains in sharp focus with a deep depth of field, capturing the dynamic and colorful environment of the street festival.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
