  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot, showing a circular stage in the center of the frame, with a large audience seated in the background. The scene is set within a television game show studio, centered around a circular stage. The main platform has a dark, solid floor and is encircled by two concentric circles of blue light, with a wider, translucent floor featuring intricate patterns illuminated from below with purple light. In the middle ground, a contestant stands on the left side of the stage's central platform, while the host stands on the right. The camera uses a deep focus to keep the entire studio set sharp and slightly unsteady as it zooms in and physically moves closer to the host and contestant on stage. The contestant, a light-skinned man with short brown hair, walks onto the stage wearing a light blue polo shirt with a red panel on the right shoulder and dark trousers. He sits down in a high chair. The older, light-skinned host with gray hair, dressed in a black suit jacket over a white collared shirt and dark trousers, is already on the stage and also sits down in a high chair opposite him. They are both situated at a central console which holds two computer monitors on chrome stands. The camera then trucks to the right while panning left to keep them centered, reframing to a full shot that centers on the two men. Finally, the camera pulls back and shifts to capture the scene from the opposite side of the initial position, offering a fresh perspective of the stage and audience, with both men seated at the central console. An overlay in the top-left corner displays the text \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, overhead shot uses a deep focus to keep the entire studio set sharp. The slightly unsteady camera initially zooms in and physically moves closer to the host and contestant on stage. It then trucks to the right while panning left to keep them centered, before zooming out and moving away to reveal the full scene.",
    "Subject": "In a television studio, two men are featured on a circular, illuminated stage. The first man, who is light-skinned with short brown hair, walks onto the stage wearing a light blue polo shirt with a red panel on the right shoulder and dark trousers. He sits down in a high chair. Already on the stage is an older, light-skinned man with gray hair, dressed in a black suit jacket over a white collared shirt and dark trousers. He also takes a seat in a high chair, positioned opposite the first man. They are both situated at a central console which holds two computer monitors. In the background, a large audience is seated in tiered rows, watching the two men.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set within a television game show studio, centered around a circular stage. The main platform has a dark, solid floor and is encircled by two concentric circles of blue light, with a wider, translucent floor featuring intricate patterns illuminated from below with purple light. On the central platform, two high-backed chairs and two computer monitors on chrome stands are positioned opposite each other. In the background, a live audience is visible, seated in tiered rows. Flanking the stage are two large, curved staircases with illuminated steps. An overlay in the top-left corner displays the text \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
