  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountainous landscape filmed by a drone, providing an aerial perspective during the day under an overcast sky. Initially, a green, tree-covered mountain ridge occupies the bottom left foreground, partially obscured by thick, white fog that fills the valleys. The middle ground is dominated by a sea of white clouds that fills the center and right of the frame. In the background, two dark mountain peaks are visible in the upper left and upper center, piercing through the clouds under an overcast sky at the top. The high-angle camera moves steadily forward and upward, gliding over the foreground ridge and pushing deeper into the cloudy expanse, revealing more of the cloud-covered landscape. As a result, the foreground ridge moves out of the bottom of the frame, and the sea of clouds increasingly fills the view, with the background peaks remaining visible amidst the shifting fog. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the foreground hills to the distant peaks in sharp detail. The serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment is emphasized, capturing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it. The drone advances over the foreground ridge, moving deeper into the cloudy expanse, and the fog moves slowly, creating a sea of clouds from which the dark, pointed peaks of distant mountains emerge. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on capturing the serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment, emphasizing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, aerial, high-angle shot of misty mountains. The camera moves steadily forward and upward, revealing more of the cloud-covered landscape. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the foreground hills to the distant peaks in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a vast mountain range shrouded in a thick blanket of white clouds. Lush green forests cover the slopes of the mountains in the foreground, which are partially obscured by rolling fog. In the distance, the dark, sharp peaks of taller mountains pierce through the sea of clouds under a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on capturing the serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment, emphasizing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a serene and majestic aerial view of a mountain range enveloped in thick, white clouds and fog. The camera glides slowly forward, revealing the vast, ethereal landscape. In the foreground, the lush green slopes of a mountain are partially visible, while in the distance, the dark peaks of other mountains pierce through the sea of clouds under an overcast sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
