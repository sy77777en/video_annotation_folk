  "merged_caption": "A blue pencil sketch of a face is positioned in the center of the frame against a white background. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, fixed on the drawing, as it showcases a stop-motion animation. The drawing begins with a dish, which is then flipped over to start a simple outline of a hooded figure with closed eyes. Through a stop-motion sequence, the sketch transforms: the hood becomes styled hair, the eyes open, and details such as a flower pin, a barrette, and a high-collared garment are added. The drawing evolves from a dish to a detailed portrait, with lines being drawn, erased, and redrawn to form the final portrait of a woman. The completed sketch depicts a woman with dark hair styled in an updo, accessorized with a flower-like pin on one side and a barrette on the other. She has almond-shaped eyes, a neutral expression, and is wearing a high-collared garment with a traditional knot fastening at the neck. The portrait remains fixed in its central position throughout this evolution.",

    "Motion": "This video presents a stop-motion animation of a blue pencil sketch being created on a white background. The drawing begins with a dish, which is then flipped over to start a simple outline of a head. The sketch is progressively refined and detailed, with lines being drawn, erased, and redrawn to form the final portrait of a woman. Features, hair, accessories, and clothing appear sequentially until the sketch is complete.",
    "Scene": "Against a plain white background, a blue pencil sketch begins with a dish being presented. As the dish is turned over, it reveals a simple outline of a person with closed eyes wearing a hood. The drawing then undergoes a transformation, with the eyes opening and features becoming more defined. Additional details are added, including a styled haircut with a flower and a clip, and the high collar of a garment, completing the portrait.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
