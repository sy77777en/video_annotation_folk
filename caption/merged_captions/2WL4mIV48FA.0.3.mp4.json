  "merged_caption": "From a camera mounted above a bright blue, open-wheel formula-style race car, the vehicle occupies the foreground and lower half of the frame, with the focus on the car itself rather than the driver. The car features a white \"GoPro\" logo on its nose cone. Inside the cockpit, a driver is visible, wearing a white racing suit with red accents, black gloves, and a black helmet, with their hands on the steering wheel. Initially, a lime green and black sports prototype car with a large rear wing and the number \"98\" on its side is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The asphalt track extends from the foreground into the background, winding through a landscape of green, rolling hills under an overcast sky. A small white building is situated in the background on the left. As the blue car accelerates on the racetrack, it follows the green car through a left-hand turn. The camera, capturing a high-angle, eye-level shot, moves quickly and somewhat unsteadily forward, performing a slight left pan to stay aligned with the road. As the track straightens, the blue car pulls up on the left side of the green car and successfully overtakes it on the straight section. The blue car then continues to drive straight down the track, leaving the green car behind, which shifts from the middle ground right to the foreground right before exiting the frame. During this maneuver, the blue car passes two sets of obstacles on the left side, each consisting of three orange cones. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire race track environment sharp.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a locked-on perspective from a camera mounted on a bright blue, open-wheel formula-style race car, which occupies the lower portion of the view. The car features a white \"GoPro\" logo on its nose cone. Inside the cockpit, a driver is visible, wearing a white racing suit with red accents, black gloves, and a black helmet, with their hands on the steering wheel. A second race car, a lime green and black sports prototype with a large rear wing and the number \"98\" on its side, is seen on the right. The blue car overtakes the green car on a straight section of the track, and the green car subsequently moves out of view.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on perspective, a blue open-wheel race car accelerates on a racetrack, following a green sports prototype car through a left-hand turn. As the track straightens, the blue car pulls up on the left side of the green car and successfully overtakes it on the straight section. The blue car then continues to drive straight down the track, leaving the green car behind.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a blue, open-cockpit race car captures the vehicle speeding along an asphalt track. The track winds through a landscape of green, rolling hills under an overcast sky. As the blue car, which features a \"GoPro\" logo on its nose, exits a curve, it overtakes a green and black prototype-style race car with a large rear wing. In the background, a simple white structure stands near the track, and the car passes two sets of obstacles on the left side, each consisting of three orange cones.",
    "Spatial": "From a camera mounted above the blue race car, the vehicle occupies the foreground and lower half of the frame, with the focus on the car itself rather than the driver. Initially, a green race car is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The asphalt track extends from the foreground into the background, where green, rolling hills are visible across the scene. A small white building is situated in the background on the left. As the blue car moves forward, it maneuvers past two sets of obstacles on the left side, each consisting of three orange cones, during which it overtakes the green car, which shifts from the middle ground right to the foreground right before exiting the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
