  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a hand with medium skin holds a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, positioned in the bottom-center-left foreground. A dirt path originates in the bottom-center foreground and extends into the middle ground, flanked by large, angular brown rocks. A significant rock formation initially occupies the right side of the frame from the middle ground, then as the camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, it comes to the nearer middle ground and partially occupies the foreground. A wooden pole stands on the far left in the middle ground, from which thin black wires stretch across the center-upper part of the frame toward the top-right. The right side of the power lines becomes obscured by the rocks later, and the wooden pole eventually goes out of the frame from the left. Green pine trees and bushes are scattered throughout the foreground to middle ground, with patches of dry grass visible. The sky, a pale, greenish-yellow, is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera remains at an eye-level height throughout the shot, moving forward and downhill, briefly trucking to the right before tilting subtly upward at the end. The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The hand holding the walkie-talkie maintains a relatively consistent position in the lower-center-left portion of the frame, contributing to the first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looking out onto the stylized, rocky landscape.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, first-person shot from an eye-level, level angle. The camera moves forward and downhill, briefly trucking to the right before tilting subtly upward at the end. The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features a hand holding a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, partially visible in the bottom center-left. The hand appears to be of a person with medium skin. The background consists of a rocky landscape with scattered trees and a cloudy sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The hand remains in a similar position throughout.",
    "Motion": "The hand holding the yellow walkie-talkie maintains a relatively consistent position in the lower-center-left portion of the frame. The camera adopts a first-person perspective, moving forward with noticeable shaking and slightly trucking to the right towards the end of the video.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out onto a stylized, rocky landscape under a pale, greenish-yellow sky. A dirt path meanders forward between large, angular brown rocks and scattered green pine trees. In the lower-center-left of the view, a hand is visible holding a bright yellow walkie-talkie. Thin black wires stretch across the sky from a wooden pole on the left, which eventually goes out of frame from the left, and the terrain is dotted with small bushes and patches of dry grass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
