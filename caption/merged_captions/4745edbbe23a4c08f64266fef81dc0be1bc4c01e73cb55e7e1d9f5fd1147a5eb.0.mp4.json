  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, capturing the expansive view of a serene beach. The sandy beach stretches across the bottom of the frame, with gentle waves lapping against the shore, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. A prominent rocky hill covered in patches of greenery is situated in the middle ground on the left side. The ocean spans from the foreground to the background on the right, with its vibrant blue contrasting against the light tan of the sand. In the background, a large patch of clouds is visible on the right side near the horizon, while the rest of the sky remains clear. The camera, positioned at a level angle, provides a sweeping view of the coastline, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the scene. The two people walking on the beach appear very small and are not the main focus of the scene. The video captures a scenic coastal landscape with waves gently rolling onto a sandy beach. The motion of the waves adds a dynamic element to the serene setting. The video is filmed by a drone, featuring an aerial-level camera moving forward subtly and smoothly with a deep focus, capturing a large depth of field. The camera maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, and concludes with a sudden pan to the left. The movement is slow and very smooth, with no shaking. The focus is on the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment, emphasizing the vastness and peacefulness of the scene rather than any specific object or subject. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the coastline, highlighting the natural beauty and expansive openness of the area.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a serene coastal scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a sandy beach with gentle waves lapping against the shore. The ocean is a vibrant blue, contrasting with the light tan of the sand. On the left side of the screen, a prominent rocky hill covered in patches of green vegetation rises near the shoreline, adding texture and depth to the landscape. To the right of the hill, a patch of clouds is visible in the distance, while the rest of the sky remains entirely clear, indicating calm weather. Two people can be seen walking on the beach, appearing very small and not the main focus of the scene.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
