  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a female-form mannequin shown from the hips up, positioned centrally in the frame. The mannequin stands with its hands on its hips, occupying the foreground. Its reflective, silver-colored metallic surface contrasts with the background, which consists of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light from the side creates a distinct outline on the mannequin, enhancing its presence against the background. The mannequin is dressed in a light gray business suit, which includes a two-button blazer over a v-neck top. Its dark hair is tied behind its head. The camera remains at the mannequin's level throughout the video, employing an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the faceless mannequin in the foreground in focus. The camera slowly moves forward towards the mannequin with a slight shake. Initially, the mannequin faces to its right with its hands on its hips, then turns its head to the center, then to its left, and finally returns to face forward. Occasionally, the mannequin turns its head slightly, introducing subtle movement within the otherwise static composition. The background remains constant, with no changes in the spatial arrangement of elements.",

    "Subject": "A female-form mannequin is shown from the hips up, standing with its hands on its hips. It is dressed in a light gray business suit, which includes a two-button blazer over a v-neck top. The mannequin's body, including its hands and featureless, oval-shaped face, is made of a reflective, silver-colored metallic material. Its dark hair is tied behind its head. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns its head.",
    "Motion": "The mannequin initially faces to its right with its hands on its hips, then turns its head to the center, then to its left, and finally returns to face forward.",
    "Scene": "A figure with a metallic, featureless head stands with its hands on its hips in an indoor setting. The figure wears a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background consists of a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light illuminates the figure from the side, creating a distinct outline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
