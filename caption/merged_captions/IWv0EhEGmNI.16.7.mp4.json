  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a woman with blonde hair in a braided bun is positioned in the left foreground, with her back to the camera. A man with a prominent dark brown mustache and beard stands in the right middle ground, facing her. He is wearing military-style attire, including a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest marked with \"G-25\" on the chest. The scene is set outdoors at night in a dimly lit, green-tinted environment, possibly an airfield. In the center background, several out-of-focus figures are visible inside what appears to be a helicopter. The man raises his gloved hand to his chest, holding an object resembling a walkie-talkie near his left chest as he speaks. As he speaks, he first turns his head to his right before looking at the woman. He then turns his upper body to his right and uses his left hand to hold the object. Subsequently, he slightly bows his head towards the woman while continuing the conversation. The camera remains static but slightly unsteady, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, using a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the man in the midground. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays subtitles in green and white text, indicating dialogue between characters named Laswell, Kyle, and Price.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a white man with a prominent dark brown mustache and beard, shown in a close-up. He is wearing military-style attire, including a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with the marking \"G-25\" on the chest. He is engaged in a conversation with a white woman, who is seen from behind, showing her blonde hair styled in a braided bun and a light-colored collared shirt. In the dimly lit background, the blurry figures of other people in military gear are visible inside what appears to be a helicopter. The man is holding a rifle in one hand and gripping an object resembling a walkie-talkie on his left chest with his other hand as he speaks.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a woman with blonde hair in a braided bun, the scene is set outdoors at night in a dimly lit, green-tinted environment, possibly an airfield. In the background, the dark silhouette of a large vehicle, likely a helicopter, is visible with several out-of-focus figures nearby. A man in military attire stands opposite the woman, wearing a dark green beanie and a matching jacket over a grayish-green tactical vest marked with \"G-25\" in black lettering. The man gestures with a gloved hand while speaking. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays subtitles in green and white text, indicating dialogue between characters named Laswell, Kyle, and Price.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
