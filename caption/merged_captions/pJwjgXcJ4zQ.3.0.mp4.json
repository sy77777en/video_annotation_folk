  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban street scene, showcasing a full view of the street and surrounding storefronts. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward along the street, initially facing the front-right, and pans left to align with the direction of motion. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking. In the 2D frame, the street stretches from the bottom center towards the upper left corner of the frame. Storefronts line both sides of the street; those on the left occupy the left side of the frame, while those on the right fill the right side. In 3D space, the storefronts are situated in the foreground and middle ground, with some buildings extending into the background. The camera is positioned at a height roughly level with the storefronts, providing a direct view of the street and its surroundings. A woman dressed in black, wearing glasses, and holding a phone walks past a brightly lit arcade store on the street. The camera focuses on the street, showing more shops and signs, including a restaurant advertisement on the left side. The environment is outdoors, featuring a standard-width street similar to a one-way lane, lined with colorful storefronts and bright signage. The time of day could be interpreted as either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. Notable visual elements include a variety of shopfronts with vivid, multicolored signs and displays, highlighted by typical colored yellow lights. The street is paved and relatively clean, with a few pedestrians casually walking along the sidewalk. The architecture is modern, with a mix of glass and metal materials. A few bicycles are parked along the street, and small potted plants add a touch of greenery.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
