  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a worm's-eye view looking up at the canopy of tall, leafless trees against a foggy sky, creating a stark and eerie atmosphere. The tree trunks extend from the bottom edge upwards, filling most of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Broken tree stumps are visible in the foreground at the bottom left and center. The camera smoothly rolls counter-clockwise and gradually tilts down while panning right, transitioning to a level angle. As it tilts downwards, revealing more of the forest floor, a person wearing an orange hazmat suit with a full-face respirator mask enters the frame from the bottom right and walks slowly forward. The person carries a black backpack with attached equipment, including a yellow device, possibly for measuring environmental conditions, suggesting a cautious exploration of the area. The camera pans rightward, creating the impression that the person is moving towards the center of the frame. The shot transitions to a medium shot, framing the person from the waist up, now positioned in the center of the frame. The trees form the background, and the camera is now at the subject's eye level. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, subtly moving backward as the person approaches, all with very smooth motion and no shaking. The dense, foggy forest with tall trees reaching into a gray, overcast sky, some possibly pine with sparse needles, adds to the eerie and still atmosphere. The ground is covered in damp foliage, and the air appears heavy with mist, conveying a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at a worm's-eye view, looking directly up at the trees. It then smoothly rolls counter-clockwise and gradually tilts down while panning right, transitioning to a level angle as it focuses on a person in a protective suit. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. Once the view is horizontal, the camera subtly moves backward, all with very smooth motion and no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a forest scene with tall, leafless trees reaching upwards, creating a stark and eerie atmosphere. As the scene progresses, a person wearing a protective suit becomes the focal point. This individual is dressed in an orange hazmat suit with a full-face respirator mask, obscuring their features. They carry a black backpack with attached equipment, including a yellow device, possibly for measuring environmental conditions. The person stands amidst the trees, suggesting a cautious exploration of the area. The overall mood is one of isolation and caution, emphasized by the protective gear and barren surroundings.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a worm's-eye view looking up at the tops of tall, bare trees. The camera then smoothly rolls counter-clockwise and gradually tilts down while panning right, transitioning to a level angle as it focuses on a person in an orange hazmat suit. As the person appears, the camera subtly moves backward, capturing their slow and deliberate approach toward the camera's viewpoint through the foggy forest.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, foggy forest with tall trees reaching into a gray, overcast sky. Some of the trees may be pine trees with sparse needles. The atmosphere is eerie and still, with a muted color palette dominated by grays. The ground is covered in damp foliage, and the air appears heavy with mist. A person in a protective suit and gas mask stands among the trees, suggesting a hazardous environment. The suit is orange with black straps and equipment, including a gauge and a yellow device, adding a sense of caution and preparedness. The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
