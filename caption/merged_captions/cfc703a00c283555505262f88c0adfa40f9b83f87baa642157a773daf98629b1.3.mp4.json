  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the entire landscape, with the river extending into the background and occupying the center and lower part of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, bordered by rocky banks that extend from the bottom left and right edges toward the center. Dense green trees line both sides of the river in the background, stretching horizontally across the frame, while hills and mountains rise further in the background, occupying the upper third of the frame. The sky fills the top portion of the frame, with clouds spread across the upper background. The camera is positioned at a low height, close to the river’s surface, providing a slightly elevated but mostly level perspective relative to the water. The drone camera, positioned above water at a level angle, uses deep focus to keep the entire river and surrounding landscape sharp. It moves smoothly and slowly forward above the river, maintaining very steady motion throughout, emphasizing the depth and scale of the natural environment. The water appears to be moving steadily, creating gentle ripples and small waves. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural. The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a wide, gently flowing river bordered by rocky banks and lush green vegetation, with distant hills and mountains rising under a clear blue sky dotted with large, billowing white clouds. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the river and its surroundings rather than highlighting any specific object or individual. The sunlight casts even illumination across the scene, highlighting the natural textures of water, rocks, and foliage. No overlays or artificial elements are present in the video.",

    "Camera": "The drone camera, positioned above water at a level angle, uses deep focus to keep the entire river and surrounding landscape sharp. It moves smoothly and slowly forward above the river, maintaining very steady motion throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a wide, gently flowing river bordered by rocky banks and lush green vegetation, with distant hills and mountains rising under a clear blue sky dotted with large, billowing white clouds. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the river and its surroundings rather than highlighting any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the atmosphere and beauty of the landscape as a whole, inviting viewers to appreciate the serene and unspoiled character of the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a scenic view of a river flowing through a rocky landscape, surrounded by lush greenery and distant mountains under a clear blue sky. The water appears to be moving steadily, creating gentle ripples and small waves. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor riverside landscape during the day, with clear blue skies and scattered white clouds overhead. The river flows steadily, its surface rippling and foaming over rocks, bordered by a wide stretch of smooth, gray stones and pebbles. Dense green trees line the banks, and beyond them, low hills and forested mountains rise in the background. The sunlight casts even illumination across the scene, highlighting the natural textures of water, rocks, and foliage. No overlays or artificial elements are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
