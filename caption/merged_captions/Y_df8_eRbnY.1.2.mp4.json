  "merged_caption": "The video commences with an extreme wide shot, showcasing a large, grey granite rock formation in the center background, with a dense evergreen forest covering the lower slopes in the bottom middle ground. The camera angle is initially level, then tilts down to a high angle, revealing a rocky outcrop in the foreground. Sparse, dry bushes are visible in the bottom left foreground, along with a few gnarled trees. As the camera tilts downwards, a person is revealed standing on the edge of this rocky cliff. This individual, a woman with long blonde hair wearing a light gray sweater and a black beanie, appears in the bottom left middle ground, standing with her side to the camera, creating a sense of scale and perspective that highlights the vastness of the landscape. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and the focus is deep, keeping both the foreground and the distant mountains relatively sharp. The woman, initially with her side and back partially to the camera, then turns slightly to her right and adjusts her footing on the uneven ground while looking out over the landscape. Below, the dense forest extends from the middle ground to the background, while the large mountain is no longer visible at the end. The woman begins walking uphill, and the scene progresses on a hazy, overcast day, showcasing the massive, grey granite rock formation dominating the background. The camera is positioned above her, and the dense, dark green evergreen forest covers the lower slopes and stretches into a valley. The video ends with the woman looking toward the rear side of the cliff, scanning up and down as if evaluating the height of the rocky mountain, possibly in preparation for further climbing.",

    "Camera": "The camera angle is initially level, then tilts down to a high angle, revealing a person on a cliff edge. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The focus is deep, keeping both the foreground and the distant mountains relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a wide view of a large, rugged mountain with steep, rocky surfaces and sparse vegetation at the top. As the scene progresses, the focus shifts to a woman standing on the edge of a rocky cliff. She has long blonde hair and is wearing a light gray sweater and a black beanie. The woman is standing with her side to the camera, creating a sense of scale and perspective that highlights the vastness of the landscape.",
    "Motion": "The camera tilts down from a wide view of a large mountain, first revealing a forested valley below. As the downward tilt continues, a person is revealed standing on the edge of a rocky cliff. This individual, initially with their side and back partially to the camera, then turns slightly to their right and adjusts their footing on the uneven ground while looking out over the landscape. At the end, the individual begins walking uphill.",
    "Scene": "The video opens on a hazy, overcast day, showcasing a massive, grey granite rock formation dominating the background. Below, a dense, dark green evergreen forest covers the lower slopes and stretches into a valley. The camera then tilts downwards, revealing a rocky outcrop in the foreground. Sparse, dry bushes and a few gnarled trees cling to this outcrop. A person wearing a light-colored shirt and a dark beanie is seen on the edge of this rocky precipice, looking toward the rear side of the cliff, scanning up and down as if evaluating the height of the rocky mountain, possibly in preparation for further climbing.",
    "Spatial": "The video commences with an extreme wide shot, showcasing a large, grey granite rock formation in the center background, with a dense evergreen forest covering the lower slopes in the bottom middle ground. The camera then tilts downwards, revealing a rocky outcrop in the foreground. This transitions the view to a wide shot of a woman, who appears in the bottom left middle ground, standing on this rocky outcrop. Sparse, dry bushes are visible in the bottom left foreground, along with a few gnarled trees. The dense forest extends from the middle ground to the background, while the large mountain is no longer visible at the end. When the woman is revealed, the camera is positioned above her."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
