  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man with short, dark hair, seen from the back, is positioned in the bottom right foreground, wearing a dark blue jacket with white Chinese characters, \"实验二中,\" printed on the back. He is looking up at a large, black-and-white mural of a Black man, a basketball player with a shaved head, wearing a basketball jersey and with his arms outstretched to the sides, which dominates the center and left of the frame, situated on a wall extending from the middle ground to the background. The video is set indoors in a long corridor with a modern, minimalist design, characterized by clean lines and a smooth floor. The setting is well-lit, and the mural serves as a central visual element, creating a calm and focused atmosphere. Overlay text appears in the bottom left corner, reading \"甚至也不是因为我的影响.\" The camera is positioned at a low, eye-level angle with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the person in the foreground. The slightly unsteady handheld camera tracks the man from a rear-side angle, moving backward and rightward while panning slightly to the right to follow his movement. As the man walks backward along the corridor, he initially gazes upward at the mural before shifting his head and gaze to look straight ahead. The time-reversed scene captures the dynamic interaction between the man and the mural, emphasizing the spatial relationship and the evolving perspective as the camera continues to track his movement through the corridor.",

    "Subject": "A large, black-and-white mural of a Black man, a basketball player, is depicted on a wall. The man in the mural has a shaved head, is wearing a basketball jersey, and has his arms outstretched to the sides.

    "Scene": "The video is set indoors, featuring a long corridor with a large black-and-white mural of a basketball player with outstretched arms on the wall. The setting is well-lit with a modern, minimalist design, characterized by clean lines and a smooth floor. The time of day is not specified due to the indoor environment. A person is present, walking along the corridor, facing the mural, which dominates the scene. Overlay text appears in the lower part of the scene, providing additional information or context. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with the mural serving as a central visual element.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a man, seen from the back, is positioned in the bottom right foreground. He is looking up at a large, black-and-white mural of a basketball player that dominates the center and left of the frame, situated on a wall extending from the middle ground to the background. White Chinese characters are visible on the back of the man's jacket, and additional text is overlaid in the bottom left corner, reading \"甚至也不是因为我的影响.\" The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
