  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a low angle, presenting a dramatic, wide-angle, time-lapse view of the Colosseum in Rome at night. The Colosseum is the primary element, positioned in the middle ground and occupying the left, center, and right portions of the frame. The ancient amphitheater is bathed in a warm, golden-orange glow, highlighting its tiered structure of arches and weathered stone against the dark sky. In the foreground, at the bottom of the screen, long streaks of white and red light from passing vehicles blur across the scene, creating a sense of motion and energy. A bright streetlight is located in the top right, casting a lens flare. The camera appears to be in motion, sweeping from left to right in a time-lapse, which causes the perspective on the curved facade of the Colosseum to shift and creates the light trails in the foreground. The time-lapse video is captured with noticeable fisheye distortion. From a low, eye-level angle, the slightly unsteady camera trucks right while panning left to frame the Colosseum. The shot also features a varying Dutch angle and uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The perspective is low and in motion, emphasizing the massive, curved structure of the ancient monument. The video lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to convey the majestic scale and atmospheric ambiance of the iconic landmark within its bustling, modern environment, contrasting the enduring stone with the fleeting lights of the city. The sweeping motion and distorted perspective emphasize the scale of the ancient structure, creating a dynamic and immersive viewing experience.",

    "Scene": "A nighttime, wide-angle view captures the Colosseum in Rome, illuminated by warm, golden lights that accentuate its weathered stone facade and multiple tiers of arches. The perspective is low and in motion, creating streaks of red and white light from traffic on the adjacent road. The dark night sky contrasts with the brightly lit amphitheater and the orange glow of nearby streetlights, which produce a noticeable lens flare. The sweeping motion and distorted perspective emphasize the massive, curved structure of the ancient monument.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
