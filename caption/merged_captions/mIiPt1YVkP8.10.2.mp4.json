  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high angle, looking down on an airport under hazy, reddish-brown skies, hinting at dawn, dusk, or reduced visibility. In the bottom center of the middle ground, a white passenger jet is positioned on a long, dark gray runway marked with white lines and dark tire scuffs, which extends vertically toward the top of the frame. As this airplane accelerates forward for takeoff, the camera smoothly tilts downward and moves backward unsteadily to track its movement, incorporating a slight clockwise arcing motion toward the end. Simultaneously, a second, smaller white passenger jet in the top center background continues its descent, flying on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Yellow-lined taxiways intersect the runway in the lower half of the frame, surrounded by flat, brown, grassy terrain. In the distance, the faint silhouette of an urban area is visible on the horizon. An overlay in a black box at the bottom of the screen displays white, typewriter-style text that reads \"FDX1432: Southwest, abort!\" and then changes to \"FDX1432: Fedex is on the go.\"",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera looks down at an airplane on a runway, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. As the plane accelerates, the camera smoothly tilts downward and moves backward unsteadily to track its movement. Toward the end, it incorporates a slight clockwise arcing motion.",
    "Subject": "This animated video shows two white passenger jets at an airport under hazy, reddish-brown skies. In the middleground, one jet with swept-back wings is seen from the front, positioned in the center of a runway. In the background, a second, similar jet appears smaller as it flies on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Text at the bottom of the screen displays a radio transmission from \"FDX1432,\" initially showing the message \"Southwest, abort!\" before changing to \"Fedex is on the go.\"",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle perspective, a white passenger jet, already in motion on a runway, accelerates forward for takeoff. Simultaneously, a second jet in the background continues its descent, approaching the same runway for a landing.",
    "Scene": "A drone-captured video offers an aerial perspective of an airport runway beneath hazy, reddish-brown skies, hinting at dawn, dusk, or reduced visibility. In the middleground, a white airplane is stationed on a long, dark gray runway marked with white lines and dark tire scuffs. Yellow-lined taxiways intersect the runway, surrounded by flat, brown, grassy terrain. In the distance, another white airplane is visible in the air, aligned with the same runway, with the faint silhouette of an urban area on the horizon. An overlay in a black box at the bottom of the screen displays white, typewriter-style text that reads \"FDX1432: Southwest, abort!\" and then changes to \"FDX1432: Fedex is on the go.\"",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high angle, looking down on an airport. In the bottom center of the middle ground, a white airplane is positioned on a runway that extends vertically toward the top of the frame. As this airplane accelerates, the camera smoothly tilts downward and moves backward with some instability to track its movement, incorporating a slight clockwise arcing motion toward the end. A second, smaller airplane is visible in the top center background, flying on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Taxiways intersect the runway in the lower half of the frame. The text overlay with orange and white texts and black background is at the bottom of the screen. "

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
