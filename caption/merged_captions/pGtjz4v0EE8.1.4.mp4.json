  "merged_caption": "In a dynamic, high-angle wide shot, a plaza covered with dark grey tiles is framed with an outdoor cafe under two white umbrellas positioned in the top right. Numerous people are scattered across both the middle ground and background of the scene. A large, sunlit area occupies the left and bottom-left portions of the frame, while the rest of the plaza is in shadow. The camera executes a smooth, complex movement, simultaneously rolling clockwise and tilting downward, capturing pedestrians who move in various directions, some walking alone and others in small groups. Their long shadows stretch across the plaza from the left. The crowd consists of men and women of various ages, all dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts, pants, and shorts in a variety of colors. They traverse the open space individually, in pairs, and in small groups. In the upper right portion of the scene, another group of people is visible, seated at tables beneath two large, white, square umbrellas at an outdoor eatery. Bright sunlight illuminates the left side of the plaza, creating long, distinct shadows from the numerous pedestrians walking across the space in various directions, both individually and in small groups. The rest of the square is in the shadow of an unseen building. This is a time-lapse video of a crowd in a plaza, captured from a high, aerial angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire plaza and the people within it sharp and clear.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
