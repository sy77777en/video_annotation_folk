  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a city park, captured from eye level. A paved walkway begins at the bottom center of the frame, extending into the middle ground toward a tall monument located in the center. This central path is bordered by trees situated around the monument, with a large building visible in the background across the top of the frame. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at the monument, and transitions to a level angle as it moves through the park. The camera then pulls backward, transitioning the scene into an extreme wide shot. This movement reveals more of the park, including grassy areas in the foreground and middle ground on both the left and right, as well as various people walking and sitting on benches and the grass. The scene is set in a city park during the late afternoon, with long shadows cast across the grounds. A wide, light-colored paved walkway extends from the foreground toward a tall, rectangular stone monument at its center. Dark wooden benches are positioned along the path, where several people are seen walking, sitting, and relaxing. The shot emphasizes the scale and collective life of the location rather than a specific object or person. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the background building in sharp detail. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from an eye-level perspective. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at a monument, and transitions to a level angle as it moves through the park.

    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a public park or square on a bright day. A wide, paved walkway leads through the center of the frame towards a tall, light-colored monument, with a large, multi-story residential building visible in the background. The scene is framed by lush, green trees and dotted with wooden benches along the path and on the surrounding lawns, where various people appear, enjoying the park—some sit, others stroll, and a child runs. There is no single main subject; the focus is on establishing the environment and capturing the tranquil, everyday atmosphere of the urban green space. The shot emphasizes the scale and collective life of the location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This scenery shot opens on a paved path in a park, leading to a monument with a large building in the background. The camera pulls back to reveal a wider view of the park, showing people walking and sitting on benches and the grass.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a city park during the late afternoon, with long shadows cast across the grounds. In the background, a large, multi-story building with numerous windows stands behind a line of tall, leafy green trees. A wide, light-colored paved walkway extends from the foreground toward a tall, rectangular stone monument at its center. Dark wooden benches are positioned along the path, where several people are seen walking, sitting, and relaxing. The camera slowly pulls back, gradually revealing more of the benches, people, and surrounding grass. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
