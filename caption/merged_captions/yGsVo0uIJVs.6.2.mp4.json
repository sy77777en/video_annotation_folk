  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a large industrial ship positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The vast ocean surrounds the vessel, extending from the foreground to the background. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the ship from above. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains this elevated perspective while subtly and slowly moving forward, keeping the ship centered as it navigates the water. The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward and downward to approach a boat on the sea, maintaining steadiness throughout. The video shows a large ship with a dark hull and white superstructures sailing on the ocean. The ship has a prominent yellow lattice tower at its center, which is likely used for drilling or similar operations. The deck is equipped with various equipment and structures, including containers. The ship is moving steadily through the water, with the waves gently lapping against its hull. The video, captured from a drone POV shot, showcases an expansive ocean setting during daylight. The scene features a large ship with a prominent tower structure, likely a drilling rig, positioned centrally in the vast blue sea. The ship is characterized by its dark hull and white superstructure, with the tower displaying a metallic framework. The ocean's surface is slightly rippled, indicating calm weather conditions. The sky is clear, enhancing the visibility of the ship and the surrounding water. An overlay element, located in the bottom left corner, contains the number [2] and is not integrated into the scene or obstructing the view.",

    "Subject": "The video features a large, industrial ship navigating through the ocean. The ship is characterized by its dark hull with a red waterline and a series of white superstructures on deck. A prominent feature is the tall, yellow lattice tower positioned centrally, likely used for drilling or similar operations. The ship's deck is equipped with various equipment and structures, including containers, indicating its utilitarian purpose. The vessel is oriented with its bow facing forward, cutting through the waves, suggesting movement and purpose.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
