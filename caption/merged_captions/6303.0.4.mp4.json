  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot, filmed from above the subjects, at eye level with a high angle, looking down. A left hand with a medium to dark skin tone, adorned with long, pink-painted nails and a distinctive orange ring, occupies the bottom left and central middle ground, holding a smartphone positioned in the center middle ground. The smartphone screen initially displays a music player interface with an image of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, and the text \"KODAK ONHA.\" The background consists of a green checkered floor with alternating dark and light green tiles, creating a geometric pattern. A finger from the right hand moves from the bottom right foreground towards the center of the phone screen, tapping the add button, which changes the display to a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS,\" featuring various flowers and a cactus, along with an \"Add to Playlist\" button. The hand interacts with the screen, indicating the addition to a playlist. The hand and smartphone maintain their positions throughout the shot. The video is shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The scene captures the interaction with the phone, emphasizing the digital content and the tactile engagement with the device. The person is wearing a light green sleeve, and the time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit space.",

The environment features a checkered floor with alternating dark and light green tiles, creating a geometric pattern. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit space. The smartphone screen displays different content, transitioning from a music player interface with an album cover to a colorful graphic titled \"Summer Hits\" with playful floral and cactus illustrations. The hand holding the phone has neatly manicured nails painted in a light pink shade, and a distinctive orange ring is worn on one finger.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
