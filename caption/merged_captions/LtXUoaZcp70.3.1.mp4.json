  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a blue, holographic-style figure of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground. He is on a dark, textured floor marked with a gold grid that recedes into the background. The figure, which has a shimmering, particle-like texture, is dressed in a uniform consisting of a jacket with a high collar and a sash around his waist. His left hand is tucked into the pocket of his jacket near his hip, while his right hand is raised near his chest. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, begins with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. It then executes a very smooth, counterclockwise arc around the static figure while simultaneously moving upward and tilting down, transitioning into a high-angle perspective. Throughout the video, the holographic-style figure remains completely stationary. The scene is set in a dark, undefined space, with the ground plane marked by a grid of gold lines that recedes into the brown background. White text is overlaid at the bottom of the scene, displaying \"[33]\" followed by \"[34,35]\".",

    "Camera": "With a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, the camera begins at an eye-level, level angle on the blue, holographic figure of a man. It then executes a very smooth, counterclockwise arc around the figure while simultaneously moving upward and tilting down, transitioning into a high-angle perspective.",
    "Subject": "A translucent, blue, holographic-style figure of a man stands in a formal pose. The figure has a shimmering, particle-like texture. He is wearing what appears to be a uniform, consisting of a jacket with a high collar and a sash around his waist. His left hand is tucked into the pocket of his jacket near his hip, while his right hand is raised near his chest.",
    "Motion": "The holographic-style figure of a man remains completely stationary throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space, a blue, translucent, digital representation of a man stands on a dark, textured ground plane. The ground is marked with a grid of gold lines that recedes into the brown background. The figure, which has a particle-like texture, is dressed in a uniform-like outfit. White text is overlaid at the bottom of the scene, displaying \"[33]\" followed by \"[34,35]\".",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a blue, holographic-style figure of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground. He is on a dark, textured floor marked with a gold grid that recedes into the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly orbits from left to right around the static figure."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
