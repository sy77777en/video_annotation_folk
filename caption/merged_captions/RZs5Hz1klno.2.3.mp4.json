  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a dark gray, matte-finished USB drive with a silver metal connector and visible red contacts is initially positioned in the top-center of the frame and the middle ground, hanging vertically above a light gray electronic device with a dark gray trim along its edge. The device occupies the bottom half of the frame, situated in the foreground and middle ground, with its USB-A ports visible in the center. The background is dark and out of focus, with a small white overlay displaying \"[2]\" in the lower left corner of the screen. The USB drive moves in a gentle arc before being inserted vertically into one of the series of rectangular slots on the top surface of the machine. As the drive moves straight down from the top-center and inserts into a port, the camera smoothly moves forward and down, tightening the frame so that the inserted drive becomes more prominent in the center. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the USB drive in the foreground. The action concludes with the USB drive fully inserted into the port.",

    "Camera": "This level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a USB drive in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves forward and down, following the drive as it is inserted into a port.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up of a dark gray, matte-finished USB drive being inserted vertically into a port. The drive's silver metal connector has visible red contacts. It is lowered into a USB-A port, which is one of a series of rectangular slots on the top surface of a light gray electronic device. The device itself has a dark gray trim along its edge. The action concludes with the USB drive fully inserted into the port.",
    "Motion": "A USB drive moves in a gentle arc before being inserted vertically into a port on an electronic device until it is fully seated.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a black USB drive with a metal connector is lowered and inserted into a USB port on a white and dark gray electronic device. The port is one of several slots on the top surface of the machine. The background is dark and out of focus. A small white overlay displays \"[2]\" in the lower left corner of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up shot, a USB drive is initially positioned in the top-center of the frame and the middle ground, hanging vertically above an electronic device. The device occupies the bottom half of the frame, situated in the foreground and middle ground, with its USB ports visible in the center. A dark, out-of-focus area forms the background. The USB drive then moves straight down from the top-center and inserts into a port. As this happens, the camera moves slightly forward, tightening the frame so that the inserted drive becomes more prominent in the center. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
