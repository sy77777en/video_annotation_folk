  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of the London skyline viewed from across the River Thames. In the foreground, a dark railing extends across the bottom of the frame, with the river's dark water behind it in the middle ground. An arched stone bridge is positioned on the left. The cityscape, a mix of architectural styles, is situated in the middle ground and background; beige, classical-style stone buildings are located in the center and center-left, while modern glass skyscrapers, including a distinctive one with a curved, flared top, rise behind them in the center and center-right of the frame. The sky, filled with large, white and grey cumulus clouds against patches of blue, occupies the top portion of the frame. The video is a time-lapse, with clouds moving rapidly across the sky. The camera, positioned at an eye-level, level angle from across the river, initially pulls backward before trucking to the right while panning slightly to the left, maintaining deep focus to keep the entire cityscape sharp. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is positioned in the lower right corner.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of the London skyline, with clouds moving rapidly across the sky. The shot is captured from an eye-level, level angle using deep focus, which keeps the entire cityscape sharp. The slightly unsteady camera moves quickly, first pulling backward and then trucking to the right while panning slightly to the left.",
    "Subject": "This is a wide cityscape scenery shot capturing a dense urban skyline from across a river. The composition features a mix of architectural styles, with modern glass skyscrapers, including a distinctive building with a curved, flared top, rising behind older, classical-style stone buildings and a multi-tiered structure in the mid-ground. A stone arch bridge is visible on the left, and the scene is set under a dramatic sky filled with large, white and grey cumulus clouds against patches of blue.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of the London skyline viewed from across the River Thames. The clouds move rapidly across the sky, and the camera initially pulls backward before trucking to the right while panning slightly to the left.",
    "Scene": "A daytime view captures the London skyline from across the River Thames under a sky filled with large, white clouds. In the foreground, a railing is visible, with the dark water of the river behind it in the middleground. The cityscape is a mix of architectural styles, featuring prominent modern glass skyscrapers, including one with a distinctive curved, top-heavy shape, alongside older, beige stone buildings. On the left, an arched bridge spans the water. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is positioned in the lower right corner.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide shot of a city skyline. In the foreground, a dark railing extends across the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by a river, with an arched bridge positioned on the left. The cityscape itself is situated in the middle ground and background; beige buildings are located in the center and center-left, while modern skyscrapers, including a prominent one with a curved top, rise behind them in the center and center-right of the frame. The sky and clouds fill the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at a level angle from across the river, looking slightly up at the buildings. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
