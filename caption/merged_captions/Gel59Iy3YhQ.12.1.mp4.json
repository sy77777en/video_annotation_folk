  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial room, captured from an eye-level, first-person perspective. Initially, a bright blue holographic console is positioned in the center background, while a large, red-glowing window becomes visible as the camera pans. A metal door is visible in the center-left background initially, with a fire extinguisher to its right. In the bottom-left foreground, a pile of debris shifts from the bottom-left to the bottom-right and then to the center-left as the camera shifts. The smooth camera performs seemingly random exploratory movements, mimicking how a person might look around a room. It begins with a slight upward tilt, then pans left. Following this, it tilts down, shifting to a high-angle view, before panning back to the right. This movement shifts the red window and an adjacent wall panel with a flashing light towards the center of the frame, while the holographic console moves to the far-right background. The scene starts out of focus and gradually transitions to deep focus, bringing the entire room into clarity by the end. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel. A small point in the center of the frame likely serves as an aiming reticle typical in first-person games.",

    "Subject": "This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of light and shadow, the functional yet worn state of the room, and the sense of place rather than on any specific character or object. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dimly lit, futuristic room with an industrial aesthetic. The camera executes rapid, seemingly random pans across the scene, simulating the perspective of a person actively inspecting the room. The room features a glowing blue holographic display, a heavy door, and a window with a red light behind it.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dimly lit, industrial room with metallic paneled walls and a metallic paneled floor. In the background, a bright cyan holographic screen glows on a desk, illuminating the area. To the left is a large window with a red, hazy view and a visible \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign. A heavy metal door is situated on the back wall, with a red fire extinguisher mounted beside it. Debris, including what looks like woodena planks, is scattered on the floor in the foreground. A small point in the center of the frame likely serves as an aiming reticle typical in first-person games.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
