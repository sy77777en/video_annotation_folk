  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot of a woman with blonde hair styled in a low, neat bun, who is positioned in the left foreground, wearing a white collared shirt. The camera, at eye level, tracks her from behind as she walks forward in a dark, cavernous interior, possibly a hangar, with a cool, greenish-blue tint casting deep shadows. Initially appearing smaller in the frame, she becomes slightly larger as the lens pushes in. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, beginning with the focus on the woman in the foreground. In the center background, several out-of-focus military figures are visible, standing in the dimly lit environment. The shot transitions into a medium shot as a man in full military gear, including a green jacket, a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch, and a black beanie, steps forward from the right background, walking towards the woman while holding a rifle. He has a prominent mustache and faces the woman directly. The camera executes a rack focus to the man in the midground. In the final composition, the woman remains in the center-left foreground, while the man occupies the center-right middle ground, confronting her. The other soldiers and the dark, curved fuselage of a large aircraft are visible in the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene. White subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue such as \"Price: The hell is this?\" and \"Laswell: The off-switch. We're turning him over.\"",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level tracking shot that follows a woman with blonde hair from behind as she walks forward, initially appearing smaller in the frame. As the lens pushes in, she becomes slightly larger. The camera, which is slightly unsteady, uses a shallow depth of field. It begins with the focus on the woman in the foreground before executing a rack focus to a man in the midground.",
    "Subject": "A woman with blonde hair styled in a low, neat bun is seen from behind, wearing a white collared shirt. She is confronted by a man in full military gear, which includes a green jacket, a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch, and a black beanie. The man, who has a prominent mustache, holds a rifle and faces the woman directly. In the dark background, other similarly dressed and armed military figures stand out of focus.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit environment, a woman with blonde hair walks forward, viewed from behind. In the dark background, several out-of-focus military figures are visible. A man in military gear approaches the woman from the right background, walking towards her while holding a rifle.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character with blonde hair tied in a bun, the scene unfolds within a dark, cavernous interior, possibly a hangar. The environment is dimly lit with a cool, greenish-blue tint, casting deep shadows throughout the space. In the background, the dark, curved fuselage of a large aircraft is partially visible. Several figures in military attire are present, with one man wearing a beanie and a tactical vest stepping forward to confront the character in the foreground. White subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue such as \"Price: The hell is this?\" and \"Laswell: The off-switch. We're turning him over.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot of a woman with blonde hair, who is positioned in the left foreground. In the center background, several out-of-focus military figures are visible. The shot then transitions into a medium shot as a man in military gear steps forward from the background group. In the final composition, the woman remains in the center-left foreground, while the man occupies the center-right middle ground, facing her. The other soldiers and the dark fuselage of an aircraft are visible in the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
