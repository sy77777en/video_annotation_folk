  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, level-angle scenery shot capturing a Venetian waterfront. A wet cobblestone promenade occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the background. To the left, the grey, choppy water of a canal or the lagoon stretches from the foreground into the foggy background. A row of traditional, multi-story Venetian buildings in shades of cream and beige, featuring arched windows and balconies with some walls showing exposed brick, lines the right side of the frame, situated in both the middle and background. A prominent, ornate, dark green lamppost with multiple pink-tinted lanterns is positioned in the left middle ground at the water's edge. While the focus is on the scenery, a few people can be seen walking away from the camera in the middle ground. The camera maintains an eye-level height and moves steadily forward, creating a dynamic perspective of walking along the promenade. This slightly unsteady, level angle, eye-level shot with mild barrel distortion moves forward, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, creating the effect of walking along a wet, stone-paved waterfront. The sky is overcast, and a light fog hangs over the water in the distance, creating a moody and reflective atmosphere on the damp pavement. The camera captures a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, walking along the wide, wet promenade in Venice on an overcast day. The damp ground reflects the overcast sky and the ornate lamppost in the middle ground. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the expansive, atmospheric environment of the Venetian waterfront rather than any specific person or object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
