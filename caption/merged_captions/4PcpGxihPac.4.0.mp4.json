  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted figure wearing a dark outfit and a helmet adorned with a single, forward-pointing horn sits motionless atop a rugged, dark vehicle that appears to be a custom-built ATV or trike. The figure is positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, facing towards the left. The scene is set within a dark, rocky cavern, with the uneven, dirt-covered ground partially lit by the vehicle's single, round headlight, casting a yellowish glow through the dusty air in the bottom-left foreground and middle ground. To the right, a large, rough-textured rock wall is bathed in an intense, ambient red light, occupying the right side of the frame, situated in the middle ground and extending into the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. It keeps a deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp as it slowly zooms out, revealing more of the dark, cavernous environment around the person on the stationary vehicle. The vehicle's headlamp casts a cone of yellowish-white light onto the uneven ground, cutting through the hazy air, while the large rock wall's intense red glow creates a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness.",

The camera is zooming out, revealing the vehicle's headlight illuminating the rocky terrain in the bottom-left foreground and middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
