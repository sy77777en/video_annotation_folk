  "merged_caption": "In a dimly lit, cluttered setting, the scene features a static close-up shot with the camera positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up toward several black-and-white photographs. The bell of a large, pale gray gramophone horn with intricate, dark, swirling patterns occupies the bottom left of the frame. A complex mechanical structure of dark metal scrollwork and interlocking gears starts in the foreground and is positioned in front of the gears, which are located in the middle ground. Additional scrollwork is also present in the middle ground, adjacent to the gears. Attached to this mechanical framework are small, black-and-white photographs with scalloped edges, prominently featuring a photo of a man sitting with a small child beside him, and another partially visible photo of a standing child to the right. A string of small, teardrop-shaped lights in faint shades of blue, green, and purple is visible in the middle ground at the top left corner. The background is predominantly dark and indistinct, with only vague impressions of some objects visible at the far right of the frame. The camera slowly and smoothly pans left to right and tilts up across the dark, intricate mechanical structure, using a shallow depth of field to keep the photographs and gears in the midground in focus.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, the camera slowly and smoothly pans left to right and tilts up across a dark, intricate mechanical structure. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the photographs and gears in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit space, the scene features several objects. On the left is the large, pale gray, bell-shaped horn of a gramophone, its surface adorned with intricate, dark, swirling patterns. To the right is a complex, dark metal structure composed of interlocking gears, cogs, and ornate, curling metalwork. Attached to this mechanical framework are small, black-and-white photographs. The most prominent photo, which has scalloped edges, shows a man sitting with a small child beside him. Another partially visible photo to the right shows a standing child.",
    "Motion": "This is a static shot with no discernible movement from any of the objects in the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, cluttered setting, the bell of a gray gramophone horn with dark, swirling patterns occupies the left side of the view. The rest of the scene is filled with a complex structure of dark, metallic gears and ornate, vine-like scrollwork. Pinned to this mechanical assembly are three old, black-and-white photographs with scalloped edges. In the dimly lit background, a string of small, teardrop-shaped lights in faint shades of blue, green, and purple are visible.",
    "Spatial": "This is a static close-up shot. In the foreground, the bell of a gramophone horn occupies the bottom left of the frame. A complex mechanical structure of metal scrollwork starts in the foreground and is positioned in front of the gears, which are located in the middle ground. Additional scrollwork is also present in the middle ground, adjacent to the gears. Several black-and-white photographs are attached to this structure in the upper center and upper right. A string of small, dim lights is visible in the middle ground at the top left corner. The background is predominantly dark and indistinct, with only vague impressions of some objects visible at the far right of the frame. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up toward the photographs."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
