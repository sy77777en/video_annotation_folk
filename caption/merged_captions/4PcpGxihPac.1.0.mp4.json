  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures two people on camels positioned in the center of the frame, traversing the middle ground from left to right across vast orange sand dunes. The person on the left camel wears light-colored, possibly beige, flowing robes and a matching head covering, while the person on the right camel is dressed in similar attire, but their robes and head covering are white. The camels move in a single file, with one following directly behind the other, as they walk at a slow, steady pace over the sand dunes, with the riders seated upright on their backs. In the foreground, a dark, rocky slope occupies the bottom-left corner, while a small green bush sits in the bottom-right. The desert extends continuously from the foreground to the background, which is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, with a distinct pyramid-shaped peak located in the center-left. The camera is positioned above the two subjects, looking over them and the expansive landscape. From an overhead level position and level angle, the camera trucks right while panning right and slightly tilting down, tracking the two men on camels in the desert from a side perspective. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire expansive landscape, from the subjects in the midground to the mountains in the background, sharp and clear. A vast desert landscape unfolds under a pale blue sky, characterized by rolling dunes of orange sand. In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving across the expansive terrain. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, one of which has a distinct pyramid-like shape. In the far distance, the landscape flattens into a plain.",

    "Subject": "Two people are seen riding on the backs of two separate camels. The person on the left camel wears light-colored, possibly beige, flowing robes and a matching head covering. The person on the right camel is dressed in similar attire, but their robes and head covering are white. Both individuals are seated upright on their respective camels, which are walking one behind the other across the landscape.",
    "Motion": "Two people, each riding a camel, travel from left to right across a vast desert landscape. The camels move in a single file, with one following directly behind the other, as they walk at a slow, steady pace over the sand dunes, with the riders seated upright on their backs.",
    "Scene": "A vast desert landscape unfolds under a pale blue sky, characterized by rolling dunes of orange sand. In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving across the expansive terrain. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, one of which has a distinct pyramid-like shape. A rocky, dark brown slope occupies the left foreground, while a small, green bush sits on the right. In the far distance, the landscape flattens into a plain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
