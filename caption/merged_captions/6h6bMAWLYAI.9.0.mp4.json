  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a light-skinned woman with shoulder-length, straight, light brown hair and bangs, positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. She is shown from the chest up, wearing an olive-green jacket over a dark top, and speaks directly to the camera, which is at her eye level. The camera maintains a level angle with a shallow depth of field and remains completely static throughout the video. The background consists of an indoor office environment, likely a newsroom, with computer monitors on desks, some displaying news footage, and glass partitions with frosted text, including 'NEWS NI' and 'S NI', separating different areas. A white office printer is visible on the left. A prominent red banner overlay is positioned at the bottom of the screen, featuring the 'BBC NEWS' logo on the left. The text on this banner changes during the video, initially reading 'PSNI chief \"deeply sorry\" over data breach' and later switching to 'BREAKING'. Below this, 'bbc.co.uk/news' is displayed, and a timestamp '15:18' is visible on the bottom right. The woman initially speaks with her mouth open, then pauses, her expression shifting to one of frustration as she appears to forget her words. She briefly looks down and to the side, her mouth forming a tight line before she mouths a word in exasperation. She then returns her gaze to the camera with a neutral expression. The spatial composition remains consistent, with no significant changes in shot size or subject position.",

    "Scene": "A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures an indoor office environment, likely a newsroom.

She is shown from the chest up, speaking directly to the camera, which is at her eye level. The background consists of an office environment with computer monitors and glass partitions positioned in the middle ground. The woman initially speaks with her mouth open, then pauses, looking down and to the side, before returning her gaze to the camera. The red banner overlay with the 'BBC NEWS' logo and changing text is located at the bottom of the screen. The timestamp '15:18' is visible on the bottom right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
