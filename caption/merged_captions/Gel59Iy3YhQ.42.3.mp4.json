  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot from a one-point perspective looking down an interior hallway rendered in a stark, monochromatic, 1-bit dithered art style, featuring off-white outlines and stippling against a dark background. The floor and ceiling are constructed from horizontal planks. In the center-bottom-left middle ground, a human figure lies face down on the floor with one arm bent, propping against the ground. Due to the stylized graphics, specific details about the person's clothing or identity are ambiguous. The back wall, located in the middle ground, features three doorways: a closed door on the left, an open door in the center revealing a small room with furniture in the background, and a doorway without a door on the right. A geometric, diamond-shaped ornament hangs on a hook on the wall in the center-right middle ground, to the left of the rightmost doorway. A bright patch of light illuminates the wooden-planked floor in the bottom-center middle ground extending to the background, around the bottom of the central open door. The camera executes a slow and smooth forward dolly movement through the hallway, while there is no discernible movement from the figure on the floor or any other elements in the frame.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a scene rendered in a stark, monochromatic, 1-bit dithered art style, featuring off-white outlines and stippling against a dark background. The setting is an interior space, possibly a hallway or cabin, viewed from a wide-angle perspective. In the center-left middleground, a human figure lies face down on the floor with one arm bent, propping against the ground. Due to the stylized graphics, specific details about the person's clothing or identity are ambiguous. The space contains only two doors: one closed on the left and one open in the center. On the right side, there's a doorway but no door. Left of the right-hand doorway, a geometric, diamond-shaped ornament hangs from a hook on the wall. A bright patch of light illuminates the wooden-planked floor around the central doorway in the lower-center of the frame.",
    "Motion": "The camera executes a slow and smooth forward movement throughout the video, while there is no discernible movement from the figure on the floor or any other elements in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A scene rendered in a high-contrast, 1-bit dithered art style with white outlines on a dark background shows the interior of a hallway, possibly within a ship's cabin. The floor and ceiling are constructed from horizontal planks. In the middleground, a person lies on the floor. The hallway features several doorways: one closed on the left, one open in the center revealing a small room with furniture, and a doorway on the right with no door. A geometric, diamond-shaped object hangs on a hook to the left of the right doorway. A bright patch of light illuminates the floor around the center door.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
