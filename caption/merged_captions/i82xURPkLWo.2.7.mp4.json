  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a Black man with a shaved head stands in the left-center foreground on a wooden porch, initially seen in profile looking toward the right. He is wearing a dusty rose-colored short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. The scene is set at dusk, with the cloudy sky painted in orange and yellow hues of sunset, reflected on the wide, calm body of water surrounded by marshland. A small, tree-covered island sits on the right horizon. In the bottom center of the frame, a metallic bowl containing a burning photograph sits on the porch railing, with the flame at the right edge, introducing a mysterious element to the scene. A portion of a modern engine-powered boat with wooden detailing is visible in the middle ground on the far left, enhancing the rustic charm of the setting. The man stands still, looking out at the water before slowly lowering his head to gaze down at the bowl. The camera is static, positioned at the subject's level, and uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the foreground. The shot is a high-angle view with a slight unsteadiness, capturing the serene yet enigmatic atmosphere as the man transitions his gaze from the distant landscape to the burning photograph in the bowl.",

    "Subject": "A Black man with a shaved head stands on a wooden porch overlooking a body of water. He is wearing a dusty rose-colored short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. He is seen in profile, looking out at the landscape before lowering his head to gaze at a metallic bowl resting on the railing in front of him.

    "Scene": "The scene is set at dusk on a wooden porch overlooking a wide, calm body of water surrounded by marshland. The cloudy sky is painted with the orange and yellow hues of sunset, which are reflected on the water's surface. In the distance, a small, tree-covered island sits on the horizon. A man stands in profile on the porch, looking out at the view before glancing down at a small, metallic bowl resting on the railing. Inside the bowl, a piece of paper, possibly a photograph, burns with a small, flickering flame, introducing a mysterious element to the scene. A modern engine-powered boat with wooden detailing is docked next to the structure, enhancing the rustic charm of the setting.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the left-center foreground on a wooden porch, initially seen in profile looking toward the right. In the bottom center of the frame, a bowl containing a burning paper sits on the porch railing. A portion of a boat is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The background consists of a body of water and marshland, with a tree-covered island on the right horizon. The man first looks into the distance before lowering his head to gaze down at the bowl. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
