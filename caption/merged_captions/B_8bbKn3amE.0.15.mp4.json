  "merged_caption": "This scenery video is presented as an extreme wide shot, focusing on the landscape rather than a specific subject. The shot begins with the turquoise lake surface filling both the foreground and midground. A brown scree slope occupies the middle ground on the left, while a large, snow-capped mountain dominates the background, filling the upper half of the frame. The camera starts at a high angle, looking down at the water, and tilts to a level angle as it moves forward, just above the water. The camera glides smoothly and swiftly, subtly panning left and right to reveal the snow-capped mountains in the background. As the camera advances, most of the scree slope on the left gradually moves out of the frame, bringing the viewer closer to the base of the mountain, which remains the central element in the background. The massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. Along the left shoreline, a brown scree slope meets the edge of the water. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus, immersing the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, fast-moving drone shot that glides forward just above the surface of the turquoise water. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the water, and gradually tilts upward to a level angle, subtly panning left and right to reveal the snow-capped mountains in the background. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic landscape scenery shot, flying low and fast across the surface of a vibrant, turquoise glacial lake. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a vibrant turquoise glacial lake. The camera moves swiftly just above the water's surface, revealing a massive, rocky mountain in the background topped with a thick glacier. The primary motion comes from the camera's movement through the stunning alpine landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone glides low across the rippling surface of a vibrant turquoise alpine lake during the day. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises under a clear, deep blue sky. The upper portion of the mountain is covered in a thick white glacier, while the lower slopes consist of steep, reddish-brown and gray rock faces, streaked with meltwater. Along the left shoreline, a brown scree slope meets the edge of the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
