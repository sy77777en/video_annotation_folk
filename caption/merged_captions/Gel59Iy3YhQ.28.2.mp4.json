  "merged_caption": "The scene is a first-person view focused on a large, white block structure that occupies the center and right portions of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is at an aerial, level angle and smoothly moves backward from a player's first-person perspective in Minecraft Creative Mode as they fly and place blocks. This movement shifts the view of the central structure, bringing more of a stepped block formation on the right side of the structure into view. The video shows multiple white blocks being placed on the existing structure one by one, with no change in the camera view. A small game avatar with light skin, orange hair, a light green top, and dark pants is visible in the top left corner as an overlay element, facing the main construction. User interface elements are overlaid: a hotbar at the bottom center displaying various colored blocks—white, light blue, dark blue, red, black—and a red flower-like item, with the white block currently selected. Control prompts for \"ZL Place,\" \"ZR Mine,\" \"Y Drop,\" and \"X Emote\" are displayed in the bottom right next to their respective button icons. An \"X Inventory\" label is in the bottom left corner. A small, light gray plus-shaped crosshair is positioned in the center of the view, aimed at the white block structure. The background shows a blue sky with scattered white clouds and a distant landscape of green and brown far below. The scene is in deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the expansive view from high up in the Minecraft world during the daytime.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a first-person perspective within a block-based game, centered on a large, partially built structure made of smooth, white, cubic blocks. This structure includes a series of stepped white blocks extending to the right, suggesting a curved wall or staircase. In the top left corner, a small, pixelated game avatar with light skin, orange hair, a light green top, and dark pants is visible, facing the main construction. The game's interface is overlaid, including a hotbar at the bottom displaying various colored blocks—white, light blue, dark blue, red, black—and a red flower-like item, with the white block currently selected. On the right side of the screen, control prompts for \"ZL Place,\" \"ZR Mine,\" \"Y Drop,\" and \"X Emote\" are displayed next to their respective button icons. A small, light gray plus-shaped crosshair is positioned in the center of the view, aimed at the white block structure. Additionally, there is an overlaid icon and prompt for \"Inventory\" in the bottom-left corner.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a Minecraft world during the daytime under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The view is from high up, looking at a large, partially constructed white block structure. The structure, made of smooth white blocks, extends upwards and outwards, with the player seemingly adding to it. In the distance, a faint landscape of green and brown is visible far below. A character model can be seen in the upper left corner of the view. Overlay elements are present: in the bottom left, an \"X Inventory\" label is next to an inventory bar displaying various colored blocks, with a white block currently selected. In the bottom right, controller button prompts for \"ZL Place\", \"ZR Mine\", \"Y Drop\", and \"B Emote\" are visible. A small grey crosshair is centered on the screen.",

User interface elements are overlaid: a hotbar at the bottom center, control prompts in the bottom right, an inventory prompt in the bottom left, and a crosshair in the center. The camera, positioned below the main structure with a level angle and slight upward tilt, moves backward.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
