  "merged_caption": "This video is presented as a wide shot, capturing a serene outdoor setting by a calm body of water, likely a river or pond, surrounded by natural elements. A bird with dark plumage is initially seen in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, flying low above the water that occupies the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned above the water at a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field and remains completely static. The bird's wings are outstretched as it moves forward, creating a subtle disturbance in the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind. The bird continues to descend, getting closer to the water surface. Upon impact, the bird creates a splash, causing water droplets to scatter in all directions near the center-right of the frame. The bird then begins to lift off the water, flapping its wings vigorously to gain altitude, and continues to ascend, moving away from the water surface towards the right side of the frame. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies horizontally across the frame, partially submerged, with some greenery visible beyond it, adding texture and depth to the scene. The water's surface is smooth, reflecting the surrounding environment, with occasional ripples indicating movement. The environment is peaceful, with subtle activity on the water's surface, possibly from wildlife. The overall color palette is natural, with earthy tones from the logs and greenery, complemented by the muted hues of the water. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests a tranquil atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera remains completely static, capturing a bird flying low over the water.",
    "Subject": "The video features a bird with dark plumage flying low over a calm body of water. The bird's wings are outstretched, and it appears to be in motion, skimming the surface. The water is reflective, with small ripples and scattered light debris visible. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies along the water's edge, partially submerged, with some greenery visible beyond it. The bird's movement creates a subtle disturbance in the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind.",
    "Motion": "A black bird is seen flying low over a calm body of water, with its wings flapping as it moves forward. The bird continues to descend, getting closer to the water surface. Upon impact, the bird creates a splash, causing water droplets to scatter in all directions. The bird then begins to lift off the water, flapping its wings vigorously to gain altitude. The bird continues to ascend, moving away from the water surface.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting by a calm body of water, likely a river or pond, surrounded by natural elements. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests a tranquil atmosphere. The water's surface is smooth, reflecting the surrounding environment, with occasional ripples indicating movement. In the background, fallen logs and sparse vegetation are visible, adding texture and depth to the scene. The environment is peaceful, with subtle activity on the water's surface, possibly from wildlife. The overall color palette is natural, with earthy tones from the logs and greenery, complemented by the muted hues of the water.",
    "Spatial": "This video is presented as a wide shot. A bird is initially seen in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, flying low above the water that occupies the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies horizontally across the frame, with greenery visible behind it. The bird moves from the center to the right across the middle ground, briefly dipping down to make contact with the water surface near the center-right, causing a splash, before continuing its flight low over the water towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
