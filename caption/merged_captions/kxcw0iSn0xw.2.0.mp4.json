  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on the lower body of a person on the right side of the frame, wearing blue shorts, colorful socks, and black sneakers. The cement surface serves as the foreground and background, providing a static setting for the dynamic action in the middle ground. The golf club and ball are positioned on the right side of the middle ground, with the ball on a small green and black mat. On the left side, three white eggs are arranged on white tees set into a light brown wooden plank. The camera is positioned at ground level, aligned with the level of the golf balls and eggs, capturing the action as the person swings a silver golf club from a vertical position on the right, moving it towards the upper left until it exits the frame. The video showcases a dynamic speed ramp effect, beginning at normal speed, transitioning smoothly into slow motion, and then returning to normal speed. The golf ball, initially stationary on the ground on the right, is struck by the club and begins to fly towards the upper left, heading directly for the eggs. The ball strikes the eggs, causing them to burst open and scatter white shell fragments and yellow yolk across the plank and the ground. The club and ball exit the frame to the left, leaving behind broken eggshells and yolk on the ground. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the subject in the midground while keeping the background and foreground blurred. The background features a low brick wall and green trees, enhancing the static backdrop to the dynamic action in the middle ground.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a dynamic speed ramp effect, beginning at normal speed, transitioning smoothly into slow motion, and then returning to normal speed. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the midground where the action unfolds. It employs a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the subject in the midground while keeping the background and foreground blurred. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing blue shorts, colorful socks, and black sneakers, positioned on the right side, swinging a golf club. The focus is on their lower body, with the golf club directly in front of them and the golf ball positioned on the right side on the ground. On the left, three eggs are neatly arranged on stands. As the person swings the club, the golf ball is struck and sent towards the eggs, resulting in the eggs breaking and bursting open. The action causes the club and ball to move out of the frame, leaving a scene of broken eggshells and scattered contents.",
    "Motion": "A person stands on the right side of the frame and swings a golf club from a vertical position on the right, moving it towards the upper left until it exits the frame. The golf ball, initially stationary on the ground on the right, is struck by the club and begins to fly towards the upper left, heading directly for three eggs on stands. The ball strikes the eggs, causing them to burst open and scatter their contents, before the golf club and ball move out of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an objective POV, is set outdoors on a paved, pinkish-tan surface during a sunny day, with a low brick wall and green trees in the background. Initially, three white eggs are balanced on white tees set into a light brown wooden plank. A person, seen from the knees down wearing blue shorts, patterned socks, and dark sneakers, swings a silver golf club, striking the eggs. The impact causes the eggs to explode, scattering white shell fragments and yellow yolk across the plank and the ground. On the right side of the scene, a small green and black mat is positioned, where the golf ball is initially placed.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
