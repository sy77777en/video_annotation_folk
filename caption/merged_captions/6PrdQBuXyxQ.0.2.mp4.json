  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman with blonde or white hair tied back is positioned in the center of the frame, running rightward along the crest of a verdant, grassy mountain ridge. She is wearing dark athletic attire, consisting of a long-sleeved top and shorts, and appears to have a small backpack or hydration vest on her back. The green, grassy hill she is on occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, behind the runner, a series of jagged, light-gray rocky mountains rises against a pale sky with a few soft clouds. More distant mountain ranges are visible through a light haze in the background on the left, with the sky filling the top of the frame. The woman maintains a steady pace over the uneven ground as she trail runs from left to right. The camera captures this scene with an unsteady, level-angle tracking shot that moves rightward while simultaneously panning left, effectively side-tracking her movement along the mountain ridge. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the runner and the distant mountain range in sharp detail. Although the camera is positioned high above the ground, its relative height from the surface it is placed on may not be very significant.",

    "Scene": "In an expansive mountain landscape, a person is seen running along the crest of a verdant, grassy ridge. In the middleground, a series of jagged, light-gray rock mountains rises against a pale sky with a few soft clouds. In the background, more distant mountain ranges are visible through a light haze. The runner, wearing dark athletic clothing, moves from left to right across the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
