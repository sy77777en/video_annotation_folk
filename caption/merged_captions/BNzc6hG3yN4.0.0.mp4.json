  "merged_caption": "In the initial full shot, a group of young men is positioned around a black sedan, viewed from a hip-level, straight-on perspective. The men, dressed in dark clothing, are gathered in an urban setting during the daytime, with large, multi-story brick apartment buildings visible in the background under an overcast sky. Some are leaning against the hood, while others are sitting on the trunk and roof, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. A man in the center wears a black varsity jacket with white details, a black baseball cap, and a black face mask covering his lower face. To the left, a light-skinned man is reclining on the trunk, wearing a black jacket, dark pants, white shoes, and has a short beard. Next to him, a dark-skinned man dressed entirely in black, with a hood, is lighting a cigarette. A dark-skinned man wearing a gray T-shirt and ripped blue jeans is sitting on the roof, making exaggerated movements. A person with long hair in a bun and a black hat stands by the open front door. Inside the car, two figures are visible: in the back seat, someone in a black hoodie and white sneakers sits sideways with their legs outside the vehicle, while the person in the front seat is also dressed in black. Several other individuals, also dressed in dark clothing, are seen conversing on the sidewalk. The camera begins at a hip-level, level angle on the group, then performs a quick and smooth vertical crane, arcing up and over the subjects. It reaches a bird's-eye view directly above them before descending to an upside-down high angle on the other side. In this final top-down composition, the car remains centered, and the men maintain their original positions around it, creating the impression that their static arrangement has been transformed by the inverted viewpoint. Throughout the shot, a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video features a speed ramp effect, shifting from regular to fast motion. The camera begins at a hip-level, level angle on the group of men around the car. It then performs a quick and smooth vertical crane, arcing up and over the subjects. The camera reaches a bird's-eye view directly above them before descending to an upside-down high angle on the other side. Throughout the shot, a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A group of young men are positioned on and around a black sedan. A man in the center wears a black varsity jacket with white details, a black baseball cap, and a black face mask covering his lower face.

    "Motion": "The video opens with a group of men gathered around a car, where one man on the roof gestures with his arms and another on the trunk brings a lighter toward his mouth. The camera then cranes upward, gradually shifting into a high angle and eventually inverting its view. During this movement, aside from the man on the roof gesturing and the man on the trunk lifting a lighter, the other figures remain largely motionless in their positions around the car.",
    "Scene": "In an urban setting during the daytime, a group of men in dark clothing are gathered around a black sedan parked on an asphalt street. Large, multi-story brick apartment buildings are visible in the background under an overcast sky. Some of the men are sitting on the car's trunk and roof, while another has the driver's side door open. The camera transitions from a street-level view to a bird's-eye view, and then to a high-angle perspective, effectively showing the scene in reverse, capturing the group and the car from directly above on the cracked pavement.",
    "Spatial": "In the initial full shot, a group of men is positioned around a black car, viewed from a hip-level, straight-on perspective. Some are leaning against the hood, while others are sitting on the trunk and roof, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. Several more individuals stand on the sidewalk in the middle ground behind the vehicle, with large apartment buildings filling the background. The camera then cranes upward, transitioning from a level-angle view to a bird's-eye perspective, and finally inverting to a high-angle view. In this final top-down composition, the car remains centered, and the men maintain their original positions around it, creating the impression that their static arrangement has been transformed by the inverted viewpoint."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
