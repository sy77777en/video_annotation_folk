  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot begins with the focus on a corkboard surface in the foreground. A red, twisted string stretches across the scene from the bottom right towards the top center, initially out of focus. The camera, with an extremely shallow depth of field, moves forward smoothly, maintaining focus on an invisible horizontal line in the foreground, close to the middle ground. As the camera progresses, the focused subjects change, yet the objects in the scene remain stationary throughout the focus change. The red string becomes partially clear, along with a small white piece of paper positioned beneath it. The paper has \"UNCLE JERRY\" printed in black, capital letters and is pinned by a red thumbtack, with many red strings connected to this thumbtack and radiating in all directions. Additionally, there is another red piece of paper beneath the strings to the right of the white piece. The camera does not remain stationary; it keeps moving forward at a slightly high angle, maintaining a level with the subjects throughout the shot. An overlay in the bottom left displays the text \"[4]\".",

As the camera's focus shifts, the red string becomes partially clear, along with a small, white piece of paper positioned beneath it. On the paper, the word \"UNCLE JERRY\" is printed in black, capital letters. The white piece of paper is secured by a red thumbtack, with numerous red strings connected to this thumbtack and radiating in all directions.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
