  "merged_caption": "The video captures a breathtaking night sky, showcasing the atmospheric phenomenon of an aurora with skillful deep focus. The faint, diffuse green light of the aurora graces the upper right, seamlessly blending with the silhouette of a bare tree in the lower left and a structure adorned with a string of warm yellow lights slightly below and to the left. A small, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right, adding to the immersive experience. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking up at a low angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly pans slightly to the left with a slight downward tilt, then reverses this movement, returning to its initial position with minimal shaking. The camera's height and slight movement enhance the vastness of the sky, maintaining a cohesive focus on the aurora and its surrounding elements. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the dark sky and the subtle beauty of the aurora, making the environment itself the central element. The camera exhibits slight movement throughout the clip, capturing the shimmering or shifting of the aurora subtly. The primary focus is on the atmospheric phenomenon rather than a distinct subject, with the environment itself being the central element. The tiny, bright blue light briefly appearing in the lower right portion of the frame adds a dynamic element to the scene. The faint, diffuse greenish light, resembling an aurora, is visible in the upper right portion of the sky, appearing to shimmer or shift subtly. The dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree is faintly discernible in the lower left corner, and below this and slightly to the left, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline, adorned with a string of lights, can be seen.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a night sky scenery shot, where the primary focus is on the atmospheric phenomenon rather than a distinct subject. Against an almost completely black sky, a faint, diffuse, and elongated patch of green light, characteristic of an aurora, is visible. In the lower left corner, the dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree is faintly discernible. Below this and slightly to the left, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline, adorned with a string of lights, can be seen. A tiny, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right portion of the frame. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the dark sky and the subtle beauty of the aurora, making the environment itself the central element.",
    "Motion": "This video shows a dark night sky with a faint green aurora borealis visible. A cabin with a brightly lit roofline is included in the scene. The camera pans slightly to the left, tilts downwards, and then returns to its original position.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a very dark night sky. A faint, diffuse greenish light, resembling an aurora, is visible in the upper right portion of the sky, appearing to shimmer or shift subtly. In the lower left, the dark silhouette of a bare tree is discernible. Further down and to the left, a structure with a string of warm yellow lights along its roofline is partially visible. A tiny, bright blue light can be seen near the bottom right. The camera exhibits slight movement throughout the clip.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
