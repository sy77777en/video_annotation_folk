  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a large, muscular lioness with light brown, tawny fur in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The foreground consists of a dark earthen slope that occupies the bottom of the frame, while the background is filled with a dense thicket of tangled, gray, thorny branches, creating a complex pattern against a darker, wooded area. The lioness, with a powerful build and two raised humps on its back formed by the movement of its shoulder blades, walks steadily from the right side of the frame toward the left, maintaining its position in the middle ground. Its head is slightly lowered as it moves forward with a deliberate gait across the dark, earthen slope. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, smoothly tilts up and pans left, tracking the lioness as it moves across the frame. This ground-level shot with a shallow depth of field keeps the lioness in focus in the midground, while the dim lighting of the low-light outdoor setting at dawn or dusk partially obscures its form and the surrounding vegetation.",

    "Camera": "This is a ground-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the lion in the midground in focus. The camera smoothly tilts up and pans left, tracking the lion as it walks. In the foreground, dark earth is visible, while the background features a wooded area.",
    "Subject": "A large, muscular lioness with light brown, tawny fur is seen in profile as it walks from right to left. The feline has a powerful build, and the two raised humps on its back are a natural part of its structure, formed by the movement of its shoulder blades. Its head is lowered slightly as it moves forward.",
    "Motion": "A lioness walks steadily from right to left across a dark, earthen slope. Its head is slightly lowered as it moves forward with a deliberate gait, passing by a thicket of thorny bushes in the background.",
    "Scene": "In a low-light outdoor setting at dawn or dusk, a dark earthen slope occupies the foreground. The background is characterized by a dense thicket of tangled, gray, thorny branches, creating a complex pattern against a darker, wooded area. A large, light-brown feline walks from right to left along the incline, its form partially obscured by the dim lighting and the surrounding vegetation.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a lioness in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The foreground consists of a dark earthen slope that occupies the bottom of the frame, while the background is filled with a dense thicket of thorny bushes. The lioness walks from the right side of the frame toward the left, maintaining its position in the middle ground. The camera pans to the left, following the lioness as it moves across the frame, and is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
