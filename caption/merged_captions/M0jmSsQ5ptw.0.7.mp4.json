  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a low angle at the subject's level, captures an outdoor scene with several structures on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges of the frame to bow outward. In the foreground, a low platform with a white ramp extends from the bottom center towards the right, holding a small white ball. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene, from the foreground contraption to the background structures, sharp and clear. A large, A-frame wooden structure with blue-painted beams is positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a single vertical post stands in the middle ground center, and a large blue backdrop is on the middle ground right. The action begins as the small white ball starts to roll down the ramp. Upon reaching the bottom, it hits a low-lying structure, causing the taut white string, which is connected to the wooden catapult, to release from the vertical wooden post. As the string becomes slack and flies through the center of the frame, the small white ball disappears from its position at the bottom of the ramp. To the right is a translucent dark cloth that allows the blue sky and white clouds to be seen through it. In the immediate foreground, a ramp made of white pipe leads up to a small platform topped with green artificial turf. A central wooden post supports a white string that is initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air. To the right is a large rectangular backdrop, colored blue and orange, with a small red flag at its peak.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, ground-level shot filmed from a low angle. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges of the frame to bow outward. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene, from the foreground contraption to the background structures, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "In an outdoor setting, a large, A-frame wooden structure resembling a catapult, with some blue-painted beams, stands on the left. To the right is a translucent dark cloth that allows the blue sky and white clouds to be seen through it. In the foreground, a low structure covered in green artificial turf has a visible layered cross-section of white and tan materials. A white, semi-circular ramp, holding a small white ball, extends from this structure. A single, vertical wooden post rises nearby, connected to the catapult by a taut white string. The white ball rolls down the ramp until it reaches the bottom and strikes a white line, causing the line to loosen and the string to fly loosely through the air, indicating a launch has occurred.",
    "Motion": "A small white ball rolls down a ramp and strikes a low-lying structure in the foreground, triggering the release of a taut white string from a wooden catapult connected to a vertical wooden post. After this sequence, the small white ball disappears from view at the bottom of the ramp.",
    "Scene": "Shot from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon. In the immediate foreground, a ramp made of white pipe leads up to a small platform topped with green artificial turf. A central wooden post supports a white string that is initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air. To the left stands a large, A-frame wooden structure with blue-painted elements, and to the right is a large rectangular backdrop, colored blue and orange, with a small red flag at its peak.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
