  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured at the subject's level, frames a silver, modified Nissan GT-R in the left middle ground, extending toward the center of the frame. The car is equipped with a large black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate and features a widebody kit with flared fenders. Its four signature circular taillights are illuminated in bright red, as is a single, smaller circular light at the bottom center of the rear bumper. A white Japanese license plate with green characters, including the number \"1 08,\" is visible on the trunk. In the middle ground on the right, a dark-colored minivan or SUV is visible further down the street with its taillights on. The background consists of multi-story buildings, some with lit signs, including one that reads \"Jackpot\" in the top-right middle ground. Various traffic signs are visible on the left. The camera, positioned at a hip-level angle, uses a shallow depth of field with the focus on the sports car in the midground. It moves in an arc clockwise motion with a slight unsteadiness, maintaining focus on the car. The silver, modified Nissan GT-R and the dark-colored minivan or SUV, along with several other cars, remain parked stationary by the roadside, while in the distant background, a bustling street features vehicles moving back and forth.",

    "Scene": "A modified silver sports car is parked on the left side of a city street at night. The car's four circular taillights and a single lower light are illuminated in red, casting a glow on the dark asphalt below. It is equipped with a large black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate. The Japanese license plate is visible on the rear. In the background, the street is lined with multi-story buildings, some with lit signs. The sign that reads \"Jackpot\" is located in the middle ground. Various traffic signs and another vehicle with its taillights on can be seen further down the dimly lit road.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured at the subject's level, frames a silver sports car in the left middle ground, extending toward the center of the frame. In the middle ground on the right, another vehicle is visible further down the street. The background consists of multi-story buildings, with an illuminated sign in the top-right middle ground and traffic signs on the left. The camera moves in a clockwise arc with slight unsteadiness throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
