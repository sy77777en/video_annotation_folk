  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a black screen. When the scene becomes visible, it presents a medium shot featuring several shirtless men. A central man stands upright in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. Other men are grouped around him, occupying the foreground and middle ground, visible primarily in the lower left, lower right, and bottom areas of the frame against a dark, undefined background. Initially, the figures are dimly lit and difficult to distinguish within the deep shadows. The video begins with a completely dark frame. Gradually, a group of shirtless men becomes visible in a dim, reddish light. The men are standing in a circle, with one man in the center, facing forward. The group continues to rotate counterclockwise, or the camera pans clockwise around them. The dim red lighting flickers intermittently, casting light on the man at the center with his bare torso and minimal facial features. The surrounding people rise and bend toward the center, repeating the motion in sync with the rhythm of the shifting light. The entire group appears to rotate counterclockwise, or the camera pans clockwise around them. The surrounding figures shift their positions across the frame, rising and bending toward the center, repeating the motion in sync with the rhythm of the shifting light, while the central man remains relatively centered. The lighting intensity fluctuates, dimming and brightening with a reddish hue. The camera is positioned at the same height as the subjects. Initially showing a black screen, the video transitions to an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus. The camera executes a very smooth clockwise arcing movement. Throughout the video, the lights dim and brighten intermittently, eventually casting a distinct red glow over the scene, making the forms slightly more visible against the pervasive darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
