  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a white outfit with orange stripes, a white hood, and goggles resting on top. She is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, captured from the chest up, with her body oriented towards a large, white object situated on the right side. This object features a black panel with buttons and is in the foreground. The setting is indoors, featuring a minimalist environment with white walls and a sleek, modern design, suggesting a futuristic or scientific theme. The lighting is bright and even, indicating a well-lit space, possibly a laboratory or a high-tech facility. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The woman is seen speaking while gesturing, occasionally moving her hand. She continues to speak and finally turns her head to the left, looking at the object on the right side of the frame that she was not initially facing. Her movements are subtle, involving slight shifts in her stance and head orientation. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, ensuring the focus remains on her actions and the object. The background consists of plain white walls, contributing to the minimalist setting. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence, maintaining a clean and uncluttered appearance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
