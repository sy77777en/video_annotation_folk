  "merged_caption": "The video, shot from inside an open refrigerator, initially presents a full shot of a man with short, light brown hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a dark maroon short-sleeved polo shirt, positioned in the background, center. The camera is static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field that focuses on the bowl of strawberries in the foreground, left, and the food containers in the middle ground inside the fridge. In the foreground, left, a large light-colored bowl contains several red strawberries with green tops. In the middle ground, a stack of three clear, rectangular glass food containers with light blue-grey sealed lids rests on a shelf to the right; the top container holds a red, pureed substance, the middle container is filled with chopped red, orange, and pale yellow fruits or vegetables, and the bottom container contains green leafy vegetables and some white, stick-like vegetables. Further right and slightly behind these containers, also in the middle ground, two green glass bottles are partially visible in the refrigerator door, with a beige carton, likely a milk carton, to their left and a brown glass bottle to their right. The man moves from the background towards the middle ground, center, reaching out with his right hand towards the containers. He grabs the stack of containers and lifts them out of the refrigerator, holding them in the middle ground, center, while the bowl of strawberries remains in the foreground, left, and the bottles stay in the middle ground, right. The man smiles slightly as he holds the containers in his hands.",

    "Scene": "The video, shot from inside an open refrigerator, shows a man in a dark polo shirt approaching. The refrigerator's interior is white, with glass shelves. On the left, a large white bowl contains strawberries. To the right, three clear glass containers with light blue-grey sealed lids are stacked; the top one holds a red substance, the middle one contains chopped red, orange, and pale yellow fruits or vegetables, and the bottom one is filled with green leafy vegetables and white root vegetables. Two green glass bottles are visible in the refrigerator door. The man reaches in and takes the stack of three containers.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
