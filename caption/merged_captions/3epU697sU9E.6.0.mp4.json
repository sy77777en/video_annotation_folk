  "merged_caption": "This is a static, straight-on shot of a 2D graphical overlay against a black background. A white horizontal timeline is positioned across the center of the frame, with white numerical timestamps located directly above it, marked at five-minute intervals such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25. The text for 10:12 and 10:18 is slightly larger than the other times. A short, glowing red vertical line is situated on the central timeline, moving at a slow, steady pace horizontally from left to right, starting just before the \"10:12\" timestamp and continuing past it, indicating the passage of time. The rest of the timeline, with its white tick marks and timestamps against a black background, remains static. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in on or moves forward toward the center of the timeline graphic, enhancing the focus on the red line's progression. The entire composition is flat, lacking any discernible depth, and the design is minimalistic, focusing on the linear progression of time, with the red line serving as a dynamic visual indicator of significance or emphasis within the sequence.",

    "Subject": "The video features a horizontal timeline against a black background, marked with white lines and time stamps at regular intervals, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25, with additional timestamps at 10:12 and 10:18. A short red vertical line moves to the right, representing the passage of time, and is currently approaching and passing the 10:12 mark. The design is minimalistic, focusing on the linear progression of time, with the red line serving as a dynamic visual indicator of significance or emphasis within the sequence.",
    "Motion": "A short, glowing red vertical line moves steadily from left to right along a horizontal white timeline. The line starts just before the 10:12 timestamp and progresses past it, indicating the passage of time. The rest of the timeline, with its white tick marks and timestamps against a black background, remains static.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, an overlay of a horizontal white timeline is displayed across the center. The timeline features small vertical tick marks, with larger ones labeled in a white, digital-style font at five-minute intervals, including 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25. A slightly glowing vertical red bar moves slowly to the right along the timeline, indicating the passage of time. The text for 10:12 and 10:18 is slightly larger than the other times, but the tick marks remain standard. The entire visual, including the timeline and text, is a graphical overlay.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
