  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium lead-tracking shot of a young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark gray long-sleeved sweatshirt, walking from a brightly lit doorway in the background center toward the foreground and left side of the frame. This handheld, eye-level shot moves backward with slight unsteadiness as he approaches the camera. As he moves past the camera, the focus shifts to the middle ground, where an older, standing man with graying hair and a mustache, dressed in a dark jacket, is visible on the right, and a younger, seated man wearing a black beanie and a dark shirt is in the lower center-right. Both men are gathered around a small, yellow, submersible-like device positioned in the center-right middle ground. The camera subtly pans right to reveal more of the dimly lit and cluttered indoor space, resembling a workshop or utility room, with a desaturated, cool color palette contrasted by a warm light source emanating from the doorway in the background. The walls are lined with pipes, wiring, a red fire alarm box on the left background, and a blue metal cabinet on the right. Various tools and equipment are visible on shelves and a workbench. As the young man in the gray sweatshirt exits the frame, the focus shifts to bring the background into sharp clarity, highlighting the two men in the middle ground as the primary focus. The older man stands up from a seated position and removes his hands from the small, yellow submersible device, while the younger, seated man in a beanie manipulates it. The shot ends with the initial subject mostly out of frame on the right, leaving the two men in the middle ground as the primary focus.",

    "Camera": "This handheld, eye-level shot lead-tracks a man in a gray shirt, moving backward with slight unsteadiness as he walks toward the camera. Midway through the shot, the camera subtly pans right to reveal more of the room. The focus begins shallow, highlighting the man in the foreground, but as he exits the frame, the focus shifts to bring the background into sharp clarity.",
    "Subject": "A young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark gray long-sleeved sweatshirt, walks into a dimly lit room with a concerned expression. As he moves, the focus shifts to the middleground, revealing two other men. One is an older, standing man with graying hair and a mustache, dressed in a dark jacket. Next to him is a younger, seated man wearing a black beanie and a dark shirt. Both men in the middleground are gathered around a small, yellow, submersible-like device.",
    "Motion": "A young man in a gray sweatshirt walks through a doorway and into a dimly lit room. As he moves forward, the camera pans to the right, revealing two other men in the background. An older man stands up from a seated position and removes his hands from a small, yellow submersible device, while a younger, seated man in a beanie manipulates it.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit and cluttered indoor space, resembling a workshop or utility room. The room has a desaturated, cool color palette, contrasted by a warm light source emanating from a doorway in the background. The walls are lined with pipes, wiring, a red fire alarm box, and a blue metal cabinet. Various tools and equipment are visible on shelves and a workbench. In the background, two men are working on a yellow, submersible-like device. A young man in a grey sweatshirt walks from the lit doorway into the main area of the room.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium lead-tracking shot of a young man walking from a brightly lit doorway in the background center toward the foreground and left side of the frame. As he moves past the camera, the focus shifts to the middle ground, where an older, standing man is visible on the right, and a younger, seated man is in the lower center-right. Both men are gathered around a small, yellow device positioned in the center-right middle ground. A red fire alarm box is mounted on the wall in the left background, and a blue cabinet stands in the background on the right. The shot ends with the initial subject mostly out of frame on the right, leaving the two men in the middle ground as the primary focus. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
