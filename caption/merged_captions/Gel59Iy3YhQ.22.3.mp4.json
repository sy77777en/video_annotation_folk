  "merged_caption": "This is a static full shot of a monitor screen, which displays a medium shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. The woman has long, dark hair with bangs and is wearing a blue jacket over a dark top. She is sitting at a table, facing forward, with a white disposable cup placed slightly left of its center in the foreground. The background consists of a wall and a wooden shelf directly behind the woman. The camera filming the woman is positioned at her level, capturing her as she occasionally shakes her head slightly and speaks. Overlaid on this video, white text is fixed in the top right corner, showing \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an ID number, a timestamp around 19:25, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles with dialogue appear at the bottom of the frame. The scene is presented as footage on a CRT monitor, characterized by a greenish tint and visible scan lines, giving it a low-resolution, retro aesthetic. The shot appears to use deep focus, as the subtitles at the bottom are clear, while the image on the TV screen itself is blurry.",

The footage captures an indoor room with light-colored walls and a wooden shelf in the background. A woman is positioned in the middle ground, while a white disposable cup is placed on a table in the foreground. An overlay in the top right corner displays white text on a black background, including \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an identification number, a running timecode around 19:25, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles with dialogue are present at the bottom of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
