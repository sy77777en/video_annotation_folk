  "merged_caption": "The video is captured in a hip-level wide shot, presenting a parking lot scene in front of a modern, beige office building with large, dark windows. A line of green hedges runs horizontally across the middle ground at the base of the building. In the middle ground, a silver SUV is positioned on the left, a beige sedan sits in the center, and the rear of a dark-colored car is partially visible on the far right. A \"RESERVED PARKING\" sign is visible nearby. The camera, positioned at hip level, maintains a level angle and employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene. It moves smoothly backward, with minimal shaking, providing a steady viewing experience. The action begins as a partially damaged metal filing cabinet enters from the top center of the frame, crashing horizontally onto the asphalt to the right of the beige sedan. As it falls and breaks apart, numerous white papers erupt from the cabinet, scattering upwards and outwards into the upper-middle area of the frame before fluttering down to rest on the ground around the broken cabinet. The surrounding cars, including the beige sedan and the silver SUV, remain stationary, with the taillights of the silver SUV on the left and the dark-colored car on the right flashing as the cabinet crashes to the ground. The scene captures the moment of impact and the resulting disarray of papers, which eventually settle on the ground.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene. The camera moves smoothly backward, with minimal shaking, providing a steady viewing experience.",
    "Subject": "The video features a parking lot with three parked cars. The first car, a beige sedan, is centrally positioned, while a silver SUV is parked to its left. A third car, partially visible on the right edge, is dark-colored. A metal cabinet falls to the ground, scattering numerous papers into the air, which eventually settle on the ground. The scene captures the moment of impact and the resulting disarray of papers.",
    "Motion": "In a parking lot in front of an office building, a partially damaged metal cabinet is seen falling from above, breaking apart further as it hits the ground. The cabinet's contents, including papers, scatter and fall around it. The surrounding cars, including a beige sedan and a silver SUV, remain stationary, with the taillights of the silver SUV on the left and the dark-colored car on the right flashing as the cabinet crashes to the ground.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor parking lot during the day, a light-colored metal filing cabinet with multiple drawers crashes onto the asphalt, already partially broken. As it falls and breaks apart, numerous white papers fly out and scatter across the scene. The lot is situated in front of a modern, beige office building with large, dark windows. Several cars, including a silver SUV, a beige sedan, and a dark-colored car on the right, are parked in designated spaces. A line of green hedges runs along the base of the building, and a \"RESERVED PARKING\" sign is visible nearby.",
    "Spatial": "The video is captured in a hip-level wide shot, presenting a parking lot scene. A large, beige office building occupies the background, spanning the upper portion of the frame. In the middle ground, a silver SUV is positioned on the left, a beige sedan sits in the center, and the rear of a dark car is partially visible on the far right. A line of green hedges runs horizontally across the middle ground at the base of the building. The action begins as a metal filing cabinet enters from the top center of the frame, crashing horizontally onto the asphalt to the right of the beige sedan. Simultaneously, numerous white papers erupt from the cabinet, scattering upwards and outwards into the upper-middle area of the frame before fluttering down to rest on the ground around the broken cabinet."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
