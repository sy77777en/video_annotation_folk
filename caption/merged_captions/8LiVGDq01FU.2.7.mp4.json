  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, an astronaut is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, viewed from behind, floating motionlessly against a background composed of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines that create a vast, grid-like structure. Scattered points of light are visible within this background structure. The astronaut, wearing a full-body, dark gray spacesuit with a prominent, gray, boxy life-support pack on their chest and back, is oriented directly away from the viewer. The camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the astronaut in the foreground, moving backward smoothly and slowly without zooming out. As the scene progresses, the astronaut appears to be floating backward, with their arms occasionally moving upward. The setting is a vast, dark, and abstract indoor environment composed of an infinite, grid-like structure of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines with a brownish hue, resembling endless shelves or data streams. Scattered throughout this complex, multi-layered architecture are small, bright points of light. The camera continues to move forward while simultaneously zooming out, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot, enhancing the sense of depth and scale within this luminous, geometric space.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the astronaut in the foreground. It moves backward smoothly and slowly without zooming out.",
    "Subject": "An astronaut is seen from behind, floating in a weightless pose with their arms and legs slightly spread. They are wearing a full-body, dark gray spacesuit with a prominent, gray, boxy life-support pack on their chest and back. The figure is oriented directly away from the viewer.",
    "Motion": "The astronaut appears to be floating backward, with their arms occasionally moving upward.",
    "Scene": "An astronaut in a dark spacesuit with a grey life support system floats centrally within a vast, dark, and abstract indoor environment. The setting is composed of an infinite, grid-like structure of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines with a brownish hue, resembling endless shelves or data streams. Scattered throughout this complex, multi-layered architecture are small, bright points of light. The astronaut is viewed from behind, slowly floating backwards in the middle of this luminous, geometric space.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, an astronaut is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The astronaut is viewed from behind, floating motionlessly against a background composed of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines that create a vast, grid-like structure. Scattered points of light are visible within this background structure. The camera moves forward while simultaneously zooming out, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
