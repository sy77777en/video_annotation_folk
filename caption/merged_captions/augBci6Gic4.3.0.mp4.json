  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of an older woman with fair skin and long brown hair, seen in profile, occupying the foreground on the left side of the frame. She is smiling while speaking and moves her head slightly. In the middle ground, a man with fair skin, graying hair, and a gray goatee is positioned in the center-right of the frame, initially out of focus. The scene is set in an indoor environment against a solid black, featureless background, illuminated by soft lighting, possibly from multiple sources. The camera is slightly unsteady and static, positioned at eye level with a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the woman. As the video progresses, the camera performs a rack focus, shifting the plane of focus from the woman in the foreground to the man in the middle ground, bringing him into sharp detail for a close-up shot while the woman becomes blurred. As he comes into focus, the man, wearing a gray collared shirt over a lighter gray t-shirt, looks toward the woman with a slight smile forming on his face.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
