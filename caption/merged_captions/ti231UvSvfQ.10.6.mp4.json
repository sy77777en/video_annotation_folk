  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young, light-skinned man with short, light brown hair in profile, positioned in the center-left foreground, looking down and toward the right of the frame. He is wearing a dark gray crewneck sweatshirt over another shirt with a slightly raised collar visible at his neck. His head is tilted downward, and he has a focused, intense expression as he looks toward something out of frame to his right. The lighting highlights the side of his face, casting the rest of his features and the surroundings in deep shadow. The camera executes a smooth and gradual movement, slightly arcing counterclockwise around the man, maintaining a level, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on him. In the top left background, a horizontal surface, possibly a shelf or bunk, is visible, with a yellow section of the wall marked with the number \"2\" in black. The scene is predominantly monochromatic, with deep shadows and shades of grey dominating the composition. To the right, a dark curtain hangs, partially obscuring the background. The man subtly shakes his head from side to side, his gaze fixed on something out of frame as he reads.",

Behind him, a horizontal surface, possibly a shelf or bunk, is visible, with a yellow section of the wall marked with the number \"2\" in black. The scene is predominantly monochromatic, with deep shadows and shades of grey dominating the composition. To the right, a dark curtain hangs, partially obscuring the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
