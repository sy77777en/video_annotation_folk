  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a vast, dark chamber is framed at eye level. Numerous dark, rectangular boxes are arranged in a grid across the floor, extending from the foreground to the background and occupying the bottom half of the frame. In the upper center background, several pale, human-like figures hang upside down, suspended near a bright, diffuse light source. Thin, dark wires connect both the boxes and the figures to the unseen ceiling, creating strong vertical lines that enhance the sense of height and depth. A small, child-like figure, initially positioned in the middle ground slightly right of center, runs from right to left towards the bottom left, navigating between the grid of stationary rectangular boxes. The camera, from a level angle, eye-level perspective, smoothly moves backward and to the left, tracking the small figure's movement through the dark room. The scene is dimly lit and blurry, with a hazy effect that obscures fine details. The setting is a vast, dark, and foggy indoor chamber, rendered in a monochromatic color scheme dominated by shades of grey and black. The camera maintains its position at the level of the small running figure, capturing the scene in profile. The hanging figures above remain motionless, suspended by thin, dark wires attached to the ceiling, their bodies limp and appearing lifeless. Below them, each dark, cubic box on the floor has a small, glowing red light on its top surface, connected to the ceiling by a thin, dark pole or wire. The small figure continues to run across the floor, navigating the grid-like arrangement of the boxes, while the camera's smooth movement enhances the dynamic motion within the otherwise static environment.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, eye-level perspective, the camera smoothly moves backward and to the left, tracking a small figure from the side as it runs through a dark room. The scene is dimly lit and blurry, with a hazy effect that obscures fine details.",
    "Subject": "In a dark, hazy environment, several pale, unclothed human figures hang upside down, suspended by thin, dark wires attached to the ceiling. Their bodies are limp and appear lifeless. Below them, arranged in a grid-like pattern on the floor, are numerous dark, rectangular boxes. Each box has a small, glowing red light on its top surface and is connected to the ceiling by a thin, dark pole or wire. A single, bright, diffuse light source at the top of the scene illuminates the hanging figures.",
    "Motion": "A small, child-like figure runs from right to left across a dark floor, navigating between a grid of stationary rectangular boxes. Above, several pale, human-like figures hang upside down, suspended motionlessly by wires from the ceiling. The camera moves smoothly backward and to the left, tracking the running figure's movement.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a vast, dark, and foggy indoor chamber. Numerous thin, dark cables descend from the high, unseen ceiling to the dark, reflective floor. At the bottom of each cable rests a dark, cubic box with a single glowing red light. High above, near a bright, hazy light source at the top center of the room, pale, human-like figures hang suspended in the gloom. A small figure runs across the floor, navigating the grid-like arrangement of the boxes. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic color scheme, dominated by shades of grey and black.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
