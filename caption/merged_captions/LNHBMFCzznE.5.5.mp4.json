  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a middle-aged, light-skinned woman with short, brown hair standing in the center-right foreground on a red carpet, which is placed on a raised stage at a TEDx Vancouver event. She is wearing a sleeveless, black, knee-length dress and black, knee-high boots. In the center background, the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo is prominently displayed, while a dimly lit audience is visible on the far left. The background is dominated by a large screen in the center top, directly behind the speaker, which shows a live feed of her. Another screen displaying the TEDx logo is in the top right background, and three red spheres hang from the ceiling in the top left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a deep focus to keep the speaker and the entire stage clearly visible. The woman stands on the red carpet, gesturing with both hands as she speaks, facing slightly to her left. She turns her upper body slightly to her left, then takes a small step to her right while continuing to gesture. The camera executes a very smooth and subtle truck to the right, capturing the dynamics of her movement. The stage is brightly lit with blue and white lights, contrasting with the dark, dimly lit audience area visible to the left. The backdrop consists of a large screen displaying a blue geometric pattern and the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo. The stage is branded with \"TEDx\" in red and \"Vancouver\" in large white letters.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from an eye-level, level angle, this shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the speaker and the entire stage clearly visible. The camera executes a very smooth and subtle truck to the right.",
    "Subject": "A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with short, brown hair stands on a stage, giving a presentation. She is wearing a sleeveless, black, knee-length dress and black, knee-high boots. Positioned on a red carpet, she gestures with her hands as she speaks, facing slightly to her left. Directly behind her, a large screen features the red \"TEDx\" logo and white text, while another screen to her back-right displays a live video feed of her delivering the speech. The stage is branded with \"TEDx\" in red and \"Vancouver\" in large white letters. A dimly lit, seated audience is faintly visible in the middle ground.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a red carpet on a stage, gesturing with both hands as she speaks. She turns her upper body slightly to her left, then takes a small step to her right while continuing to gesture.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a brightly lit stage at a TEDx Vancouver event. A woman stands on a rectangular red carpet placed on a raised platform. The backdrop consists of a large screen displaying a blue geometric pattern and the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo. Three large red spheres hang from the ceiling above. A large video screen above the stage shows a live feed of the speaker, while another screen to the far right displays the TEDx logo. The stage is illuminated with blue and white lights, contrasting with the dark, dimly lit audience area visible to the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
