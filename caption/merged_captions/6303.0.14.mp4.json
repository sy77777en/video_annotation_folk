  "merged_caption": "The video displays a medium shot, focusing on a man with medium brown skin and a voluminous afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red textured sweater, located in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Occupying the foreground are two hands: one holding a white comb on the bottom left and the other holding a pair of pink scissors on the bottom right, suggesting a haircut is about to take place. The background features a vibrant barbershop setting with a checkered black-and-white floor, mirrors, and shelves, enhanced by neon lights in warm tones that add a colorful glow. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground. The camera tilts up with some shaking, then moves forward to track the man as he moves backward while facing the camera, maintaining the subject's level. The man appears to be talking, and his expression changes, indicating interaction. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and engaging, with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity. The setting is lively, with the man centrally positioned in front of the viewer, emphasizing the interaction between him and the person holding the grooming tools. The movement is slightly unsteady, enhancing the first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, creating an immersive experience in the barbershop environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
