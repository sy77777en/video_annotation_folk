  "merged_caption": "In a black-and-white video, a man with short, dark hair wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, dark trousers, and dark sneakers with a white stripe skateboards forward across a paved outdoor area. The scene features a tall chain-link fence in the background, with metal monkey bars and other playground structures visible. The asphalt ground is furnished with several simple wooden picnic tables and benches, and a few sparse trees are around the perimeter, bordered by plain, boxy buildings. In a full shot, the man enters from the left middle ground, and the camera, positioned at eye level, smoothly pans right, keeping him centered as he moves across the frame. As he approaches a picnic table located in the center middle ground, he suddenly stops abruptly, stumbles forward a couple of steps, and uses his hands to support himself on the tabletop. His body is momentarily suspended in the air before he prepares to land backward. The skateboard continues to roll forward beneath the table in the middle ground before coming to a stop. The camera stops its movement as the man is halted by the picnic table, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the man and the background elements in sharp detail. The man remains in the center of the frame as he supports himself above the picnic table.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot smoothly pans to the right, tracking a man on a skateboard. The camera stops its movement as the man is halted by a picnic table. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the man and the background elements in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A man with short, dark hair is shown in a black-and-white video. He wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt, dark trousers, and dark sneakers with a white stripe. The man is skateboarding and, upon approaching a picnic table, he dismounts his board, places his hands on the tabletop, and then prepares to land steadily after jumping over it. His skateboard continues to roll forward on its own after he gets off.",
    "Motion": "A man skateboards forward across a paved area.

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a paved outdoor area, presented in black and white. A tall chain-link fence lines the background, behind which stands a set of metal monkey bars and other playground structures. The asphalt ground is furnished with several simple wooden picnic tables and benches. A few sparse trees are visible around the perimeter of the space, which is also bordered by plain, boxy buildings. The camera pans smoothly, following movement across the open area.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man on a skateboard enters from the left middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans right, keeping the man centered as he moves across the frame. He approaches a picnic table located in the center middle ground. Upon reaching it, he dismounts, and his skateboard rolls beneath the table in the middle ground before stopping. The man remains in the center of the frame as he supports himself above the picnic table."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
