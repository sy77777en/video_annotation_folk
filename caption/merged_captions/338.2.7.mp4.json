  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of an elderly man, positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is seated at a dining table in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair and glasses. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on him initially. As the scene progresses, the camera smoothly pans left, transitioning focus to a woman in a yellow patterned blouse sitting next to him. She has glasses and shoulder-length dark hair, holding chopsticks and slightly turning her head to the right of the frame, appearing to be engaged in conversation. She moves into the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, with her upper body visible. The camera remains at her eye level throughout. Both subjects are seated at the same table, which is in the foreground, with plates of food and glasses of iced beverages placed on it. The background includes other dining tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs, along with a ceiling featuring intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture, casting a soft glow over the scene. Notable visual elements include plates of food, primarily noodles, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted palette. The environment is intimate, with a focus on the dining experience. The overall ambiance is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet conversation and shared meals. The transition from the man to the woman is smooth, maintaining a consistent shot size and camera height while shifting the focus horizontally across the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
