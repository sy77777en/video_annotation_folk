  "merged_caption": "A wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures the interior of a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls. A bed of dark, tilled soil with parallel black drip irrigation hoses extends from the foreground to the background. Several weathered, rectangular wooden planks are positioned across the soil in the foreground, middle ground, and background. In the background, a dense row of large, vining plants with broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves spans the width of the frame, supported by thin wooden stakes. The arched structure of the greenhouse is visible along the top and sides. This time-lapse video is captured from a fixed but slightly unsteady, eye-level camera positioned at a high angle. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse interior, including the soil in the foreground and the plants in the background, sharp and clear. Although the camera is fixed, it is slightly unsteady, capturing subtle movements, including signs of plant growth. A person appears briefly a few times to tend to the plants. The scene is brightly lit by diffuse daylight filtering through the plastic covering as the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing more of the greenhouse's interior.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a fixed but slightly unsteady, eye-level camera positioned at a high angle. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire greenhouse interior, including the soil in the foreground and the plants in the background, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, a wide bed of dark, tilled soil stretches from the foreground to the back. Laid across the soil are several parallel lines of a black drip irrigation hose system. A few weathered, rectangular wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil bed. At the far end of the bed, multiple dense rows of large, vining plants with broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves grow vigorously, supported by thin wooden stakes.",
    "Motion": "This video features a static, wide shot from inside a greenhouse. Although the camera is fixed, it is slightly unsteady. The scene captures subtle movements, including signs of plant growth and a person who appears briefly a few times to tend to the plants.",
    "Scene": "Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, a wide bed of dark, tilled soil fills the space. Several parallel black irrigation hoses run the length of the soil bed, with weathered wooden planks placed intermittently across them. In the background, a row of large, leafy green plants, possibly squash or pumpkin, is supported by wooden stakes. The scene is brightly lit by diffuse daylight filtering through the plastic covering as the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing more of the greenhouse's interior.",
    "Spatial": "A wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures the interior of a greenhouse. A bed of tilled soil with parallel black irrigation hoses extends from the foreground to the background. Several wooden planks are positioned across the soil in the foreground, middle ground, and background. In the background, a dense row of large, leafy green plants spans the width of the frame. The arched structure of the greenhouse is visible along the top and sides. The camera remains stationary but exhibits a slight, unsteady motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
