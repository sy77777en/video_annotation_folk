  "merged_caption": "The video begins as a full shot, featuring a grayscale, low-polygon man in the middle ground, left of center, beside a light-colored, low-polygon SUV, identifiable as an older model Ford Bronco by the \"Ford\" logo on its tailgate, with its driver's side door open. Another low-polygon, grayscale figure is visible inside this SUV. The man is facing slightly to his right, with his right arm raised and bent, his hand near his head as if holding a phone or gesturing, while his left hand is at his side, possibly in his pocket. Low-polygon trees and a low fence are situated in the background, spanning from the left towards the right. A paved surface is in the foreground, while a road in the middle ground extends from behind the SUV towards the left rear before curving towards the right side of the frame. The camera starts at hip level, focused on the man and the SUV positioned in the midground with a shallow depth of field. As the camera slowly moves backward and slightly downward to ground level, the shot transitions to a wide shot; consequently, the subjects appear smaller within the frame, and the front portion of a second light-colored, low-polygon vehicle, located on the far right, becomes slightly more visible in the foreground. Despite the motion of the camera, both the man and the SUV remain static. The interior of the SUV becomes more visible, showing a seated figure inside. As the camera continues to pull back, more of the surrounding environment is revealed, including trees and a low fence in the background. Throughout the scene, the camera maintains a position at the subjects' level, and the SUV shifts to the center of the middle ground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at hip level, focused on a man and an SUV positioned in the midground with a shallow depth of field. It then slowly moves backward and slightly downward to ground level, consistently maintaining focus on the man and the SUV in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady.",
    "Subject": "The video displays a grayscale, low-polygon 3D animated scene. In the middle ground, a low-polygon, grayscale man stands to the left of a light-colored, low-polygon SUV, which appears to be an older model Ford Bronco. The man is facing slightly to his right, which is the left side of the frame, with his right arm raised and bent, his hand near his head as if holding a phone or gesturing, while his left hand is at his side, possibly in his pocket. The driver's side door of the SUV is open. Inside the SUV, the head and shoulders of another low-polygon, grayscale figure are visible, seated inside the vehicle. The SUV has a spare tire mounted on its rear, and a \"Ford\" logo is discernible on the tailgate. On the far right, the front portion of a second, light-colored, low-polygon vehicle is partially visible. The background consists of low-polygon, grayscale trees and a low fence.",
    "Motion": "The scene begins with a full view of a grayscale man standing next to an open car door of a light-colored SUV, appearing to be in conversation or gesturing. Despite the motion of the camera gradually moving backward, both the man and the car remain static. The interior of the SUV becomes more visible, showing a seated figure inside. As the camera continues to pull back, more of the surrounding environment is revealed, including trees and a low fence in the background. A second vehicle on the right side of the frame becomes more visible, but the focus remains on the static man and the SUV.",
    "Scene": "The video is set on a paved suburban street during the daytime, rendered in a monochromatic, low-polygon style. In the middle ground, a light-colored SUV, identifiable as a Ford Bronco by the logo on its tailgate, is parked with its left side door open. A spare tire is mounted on its rear. A gray, low-polygon human-like figure stands beside the open door, while a person is seated inside the vehicle. The ground is light gray, while the road surface is dark gray, with distinct shadows indicating a light source. Behind the SUV, the dark gray road extends from the original direction to the left rear and then turns to extend towards the right side of the frame. To the right, the front portion of a second light-colored vehicle becomes slightly more visible as the video progresses.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins as a full shot, featuring a low-polygon man in the middle ground, left of center, beside an SUV with its driver's side door open, which is initially positioned on the right side of the middle ground. Another figure is visible inside this SUV. Low-polygon trees are situated in the background, spanning from the left towards the right, with a low fence also in the background behind the man and SUV. A paved surface is in the foreground, while a road in the middle ground extends from behind the SUV towards the left rear before curving towards the right side of the frame. The shot then transitions to a wide shot; consequently, the subjects appear smaller within the frame, and the front portion of a second vehicle, located on the far right, becomes slightly more visible in the foreground. As the camera moves backward, the SUV shifts to the center of the middle ground. Throughout the scene, the camera maintains a position at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
