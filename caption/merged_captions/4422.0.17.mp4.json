  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a young, light-skinned man with short, light brown hair, actively playing a silver and chrome drum kit with gold-colored rims and brass cymbals, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is wearing a light blue suit over a white hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. The dark rooftop occupies the foreground and middle ground, with red brick chimneys visible on the left. In the background, a sprawling cityscape with varied architectural styles stretches across the frame under a cloudy, overcast sky, with a distant church steeple visible. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, rapidly moves forward toward the drummer, tilting up slightly to create a low-angle shot of his upper body. The scene is captured in deep focus, though the left side of the background appears blurrier than the right. The drummer alternates hands while playing, with his right hand positioned higher than his left, captured in a dynamic pose with one arm raised, holding a drumstick. His facial expression is intense as he plays. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, bringing both the man and the drum kit into the foreground, emphasizing the dynamic motion of his playing.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, level-angle, hip-level perspective, the camera rapidly moves forward toward the drummer, tilting up slightly to create a low-angle shot of his upper body. The scene is captured in deep focus, though the left side of the background appears blurrier than the right.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, light brown hair is shown actively playing a drum kit. He is wearing a light blue suit, consisting of a jacket and matching trousers, over a white hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. Seated at the silver and chrome drum kit with gold-colored rims and brass cymbals, he alternates hands while playing, captured in a dynamic pose with one arm raised, holding a drumstick. His facial expression is intense as he plays.",
    "Motion": "The drummer alternates hands while playing, with his right hand positioned higher than his left, captured in a dynamic pose.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a dark, flat rooftop overlooking a sprawling cityscape under a cloudy, overcast sky. Red brick chimneys rise from the roof's surface. In the background, a dense arrangement of buildings with varied architectural styles and rooftops stretches to the horizon, with a distant church steeple visible. Positioned in the center of the rooftop is a drum kit, which has a silver-colored finish on the main drums, a smaller gold-colored tom, and brass cymbals. A person in a light blue suit is seated at the kit, actively playing with their right arm raised higher than their left arm.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
