  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up, presenting a heavily blurred image of a person's eye and nose alongside a golden object on the left side of the frame. The shot then transitions to a close-up as a rack focus reveals a line of soldiers in profile. The first soldier is positioned in the foreground on the left, with the line extending diagonally into the middle ground and background toward the right. The focus initially sharpens on the foreground soldier, after which it racks to the soldier in the middle ground, bringing him into focus while the foreground soldier becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, beginning with a slightly out-of-focus scene before smoothly transitioning to an eye-level shot that trucks right while panning left along a line of soldiers. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the golden chin strap of the soldier in the foreground on the left side of the frame. A rack focus then shifts the plane of focus to the soldiers further down the line in the midground. In a dimly lit setting with a dark, indistinct background, a row of soldiers stands in profile, wearing tall, black, furry hats with golden chin straps descending from them. These straps, composed of interlocking, flat, metallic links, are positioned under their lower lips. The scene is captured with an extremely shallow depth of field, utilizing a rack focus technique. Initially, the image is out of focus, then shifts to focus on the soldiers in the foreground, and subsequently on those in the middleground, while the background remains consistently blurred. The focused lighting accentuates the metallic sheen of the chin straps and the contours of the soldiers' faces.",

    "Subject": "The video opens on an extreme, out-of-focus close-up of a person's right eye and nose, with a textured, golden chinstrap visible near the earlobe. The scene then resolves to show a line of men in profile, facing to the right. These men, appearing to be soldiers in ceremonial dress, wear tall, black, furry hats, which are part of the British guard's uniform. A prominent, gold-colored, braided chain-link strap is fastened under each man's chin. They have fair skin and are clean-shaven, maintaining neutral expressions while standing at attention. A portion of their uniform is visible, showing a high white collar and a red tunic.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a rack focus technique, where the depth of focus travels down the line of soldiers, bringing the closest soldiers into sharp focus first before they become blurry again as the focus shifts. The soldiers stand at attention, facing to the right of the frame, completely still, with expressions of solemn concentration.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
