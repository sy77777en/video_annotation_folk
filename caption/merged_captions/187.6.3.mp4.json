  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot framed from outside the front windshield of a stationary car, looking in at four occupants. Their chest-up bodies are visible. In the middle ground, a woman occupies the front passenger seat on the left side of the frame, wearing a headscarf, a light-colored turtleneck, and a dark jacket, with a calm expression. Behind her, slightly further back in the middle ground and positioned towards the center-left, is another woman in the back seat, wearing a light headscarf and slightly turned towards the others, engaged in conversation. A third woman sits in the back seat, positioned in the center and also in the middle ground, partially obscured, appearing to be speaking. The driver, a woman with short hair, occupies the front seat on the right side of the frame, in the middle ground. A string of beads hangs from the rearview mirror in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The car's windshield frame and part of the hood occupy the foreground. The background, visible dimly through the windows, is indistinct. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene inside a car. It uses deep focus, ensuring all elements within the frame are sharp. The camera smoothly zooms out with minimal shaking at the beginning, transitioning to a stable position while focusing on the individuals seated inside the vehicle. Initially, all three women focus their attention on the woman seated on the left in the front row, who speaks and closes her eyes. The two women in the back seat then shift their attention to the driver on the right, who continues to look at the woman on the left. The woman seated on the right in the back speaks and gestures, then the driver turns forward and looks downward. Subtitles at the bottom of the screen read, \"Fardosa, what's going on?\" and \"She's in her own world,\" indicating the conversation is about the woman in the front left seat. The overall mood is calm and introspective, with the car's enclosed space providing a sense of intimacy.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
