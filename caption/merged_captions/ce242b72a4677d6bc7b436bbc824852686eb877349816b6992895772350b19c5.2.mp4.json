  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot frames a woman with long, straight, dark hair and East Asian features, wearing a tan trench coat over a black top and a small, gold hoop earring in her left ear, seated in the middle ground of a car's back seat with light beige leather seats. The car's interior, including a headrest, occupies the right side of the frame, while the car door and window are on the left. Through the tinted window, the exterior of a light-colored building and indistinct greenery can be seen passing by, suggesting the car is moving. The woman initially looks down and toward the bottom left of the frame before slowly turning her head to her right, which is toward the left side of the frame, shifting her profile to face the left edge of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's eye level, exhibits slight shakiness throughout the shot, using a shallow depth of field. The movement of the background through the window suggests the car is turning right. After a few moments, she gradually turns her head back to its original downward-looking position.",

    "Camera": "From a low, eye-level angle, the unsteady, handheld camera focuses on a woman in the back seat of a car. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, and the movement of the background through the window suggests the car is turning right.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, straight, dark hair and what appears to be East Asian features is seated in the back of a car. She is wearing a tan trench coat over a black top and has a small, gold hoop earring in her left ear. The car's interior features light-colored leather seats. She is shown in a three-quarter view, initially looking down before turning her head to gaze out the right-side window.",
    "Motion": "A woman sits in the back of a car, initially looking down. She slowly turns her head to the right, raising her chin to gaze out the window. After a few moments, she gradually turns her head back to its original downward-looking position.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place during the day from inside a moving vehicle, showing the back passenger area. The car's interior features light beige leather seats with a visible headrest. A woman with long, dark hair, wearing a tan trench coat, is seated and gazes out the side window. Through the tinted window, the exterior of a light-colored building and indistinct greenery can be seen passing by.",
    "Spatial": "This medium close-up shot frames a woman in the center of the frame, seated in the middle ground of a car's back seat. The car's interior, including a headrest, occupies the right side of the frame, while the car door and window are on the left. Through the window, a building is visible in the background. The woman initially looks down and toward the bottom left of the frame before slowly turning her head to her right, which is toward the left side of the frame, shifting her profile to face the left edge of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's eye level, exhibits slight shakiness throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
