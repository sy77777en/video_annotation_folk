  "merged_caption": "A full shot of a black Cadillac presidential limousine is presented in the center of the frame and the middle ground, angled towards the left against a solid gray background. The glossy, long, armored vehicle features tinted windows, large silver multi-spoke wheels, and two flags mounted on the front fenders: the American flag on the front passenger-side fender and a blue Presidential Seal flag on the driver-side fender. A circular Presidential Seal emblem is also present on the rear passenger door. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the limousine, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire vehicle sharp against the plain background. This movement transitions the view from a front three-quarter perspective to a side profile, and finally to a rear three-quarter perspective, showcasing the car's full length. As the camera shifts to show the rear of the car, the limousine moves into the foreground, revealing its rear design, which includes vertical taillights and another Cadillac crest on the trunk. The view concludes with a direct shot of the vehicle's rear. At the beginning of the video, an overlay of blue text on a white background briefly appears, displaying 'CADILLAC \"THE BEAST\"'. The limousine is equipped with a prominent front grille with the Cadillac crest and two antennas on the rear of the roof.",

    "Scene": "In a studio setting with a solid dark gray background, a long, black armored limousine is showcased. The glossy vehicle, a modern Cadillac design, features tinted windows, large silver multi-spoke wheels, and two flags mounted on the front fenders: the American flag and a blue presidential flag. A circular seal is also present on the rear passenger door. The perspective smoothly arcs around the car, starting from a front three-quarter view and moving to reveal its side and rear profiles. At the beginning of the video, an overlay of blue text on a white background briefly appears, displaying 'CADILLAC \"THE BEAST\"'.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
