  "merged_caption": "In a slightly unsteady wide shot, a group of people is framed from a level angle on a sunlit, wooded hillside. Out-of-focus foliage occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame, creating depth. The group is positioned in the middle ground on the upward slope; a central figure with dark curly hair and a dark t-shirt sits in the middle of the frame, facing slightly to his right, while another person in a dark hooded garment is located higher up in the upper left. Other individuals are scattered around them in the middle ground, some lying on the rocks and others sitting, all remaining mostly still. The background, filling the top of the frame, consists of bare trees silhouetted against a clear blue sky. The entire scene is viewed through a hazy, soft-focus filter, creating bright, circular lens flares and a dream-like visual quality. The ground slopes upward, covered in brown fallen leaves, green plants, and scattered concrete blocks. The camera is positioned at the subjects, looking straight at them, and moves slightly to the left with minor, unsteady shaking, using deep focus to keep the group of people on the hill and their surroundings sharp, while the plants in the foreground appear blurred.",

    "Camera": "This ground-level, level-angle shot uses deep focus to keep the group of people on the hill and their surroundings sharp, while the plants in the foreground appear blurred. The camera moves slightly to the left with minor, unsteady shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a group of people sitting on a sun-dappled, leafy hillside. One individual in the center, with dark curly hair and a dark t-shirt, is seated facing slightly to his right. Another person, wearing a dark hooded garment, is seated higher up on the left. Other less distinct figures are also present, forming a scattered group in the natural setting.",
    "Motion": "A group of people is positioned in various ways on a sunlit, wooded hillside, with some lying on the rocks and others sitting, all remaining mostly still.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds on a sunlit, wooded hillside under a clear blue sky. The ground slopes upward, covered in brown fallen leaves, green plants, and scattered concrete blocks. In the background, a line of tall, bare trees is silhouetted against the bright sky. The entire scene is viewed through a hazy, soft-focus filter, creating bright, circular lens flares and a dream-like visual quality. Blurred green foliage is visible in the foreground. A group of people are resting on the hillside, sitting and lying among the rocks and vegetation.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
