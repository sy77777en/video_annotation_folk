  "merged_caption": "This high-angle full shot opens with an olive-green military-style helicopter with a rounded nose and large pods on its sides in the top-left foreground, positioned over a ship that occupies the center and bottom of the frame in the middle ground. The ship, featuring a white and grey hull and a prominent yellow, lattice-like crane structure on its deck, is surrounded by dark, choppy water. The helicopter, with its rotors in motion, initially hovers close to the bow of the ship and flies toward the camera's perspective, moving toward the left side of the frame. The camera smoothly moves backward, pans slightly to the left, and descends slightly while panning up, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. As the helicopter exits the frame at the top right, the shot transitions into a medium shot, focusing on the bow of the ship, which remains in the center of the frame. The ship's deck is equipped with various white and grey mechanical components, including vents, winches, several small red horns, white cylindrical tanks, and satellite dishes. The camera continues to track the ship as it moves steadily through the water, revealing more of the vessel below and adding depth to the shot. A subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"[2]\".",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera smoothly moves backward, pans slightly to the left, and descends slightly while panning up, revealing more of the ship below and adding depth to the shot. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "An olive-green military-style helicopter with a rounded nose and large pods on its sides is shown flying towards the camera's perspective, revealing the bow of a ship on dark water. The ship has a white and grey hull and features a prominent, yellow, lattice-like crane structure on its deck. The deck is also equipped with various white and grey mechanical components, including vents, winches, and several small red horns.",
    "Motion": "An olive-green helicopter, initially hovering close to the bow of a ship, flies toward the camera's perspective. It moves toward the left side of the frame and eventually exits the view, revealing the full bow of the vessel below. The camera maintains its high-angle position, continuing to track the ship as it moves steadily through the water.",
    "Scene": "A drone video captures a military-style helicopter flying over a ship on the open sea. The grey-green helicopter, with its rotors in motion, initially appears close before moving away over the vessel below. The ship features a white superstructure, a grey deck, and a prominent yellow, lattice-like crane amidships. Various pieces of equipment, including white cylindrical tanks and satellite dishes, are visible on its decks. The vessel is surrounded by dark, choppy water. A subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"[2]\".",
    "Spatial": "This high-angle full shot opens with an olive-green helicopter in the top-left foreground, positioned over a ship that occupies the center and bottom of the frame in the middle ground. The ship is surrounded by dark water. The helicopter then flies away from the camera and exits the frame at the top right. As it leaves, the shot transitions into a medium shot, focusing on the bow of the ship, which remains in the center of the frame. A prominent yellow crane is visible on the ship's deck in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
