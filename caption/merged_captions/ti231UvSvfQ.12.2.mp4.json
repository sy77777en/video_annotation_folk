  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a tabletop with various items. A board featuring a black-and-white photographic cutout of a dolphin's head and upper body emerging from choppy water is positioned slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground, occupying 80% of the frame's height. The dolphin, facing left with its mouth open revealing small teeth, has a yellow and orange striped party hat collaged onto its head. The board has a light background with thin vertical lines. To its left and slightly behind it in the middle ground, a black landline telephone with a handset resting on its base is visible. In the middle ground, to the left of the dolphin board and in front of the telephone, several pens lie on the tabletop; one is black, another is white, and to the right of the white pen is a third pen with a dark cap. There is also a fourth pen that is possibly blue. A grey square-shaped device that appears to be a calculator is positioned near the telephone and behind the pens. A silver computer mouse is partially visible in the foreground at the bottom left corner. The light-colored wooden tabletop occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a plain, light-colored wall in the background. The scene remains static, with no discernible movement from the dolphin-themed board, the telephone, pens, calculator, or computer mouse on the tabletop. The camera is static and positioned at a level angle. Initially, the entire frame is out of focus. Through a rack focus, the camera shifts to focus on the rectangular board in the middle ground. There is also a slight shaking of the camera. The lighting is even, suggesting an indoor environment.",

    "Subject": "A rectangular board, standing upright on a light-colored wooden tabletop, features a black-and-white photographic cutout of a dolphin's head and upper body emerging from choppy water. The dolphin, facing left with its mouth open revealing small teeth, has a yellow and orange striped party hat collaged onto its head. The background of the board behind the dolphin image is light-colored with thin vertical lines. Behind and to the left of this board, a black landline telephone with a handset resting on its base is visible. To the left of the dolphin board and in front of the telephone, several pens lie on the tabletop; one is black, another is white, and to the right of the white pen is a third pen with a dark cap.

    "Scene": "The scene is an indoor shot of a light-colored wooden desk. In the middleground, a rectangular board stands upright, displaying a black and white image of a dolphin emerging from water with its mouth open. A yellow and orange striped party hat is collaged onto the dolphin's head, and the board has a light background with faint vertical lines. To the left and slightly behind the board, a black landline telephone with a keypad and coiled cord rests on the desk. Near the telephone, there is a gray rectangular flat object that appears to be a calculator. In front of the telephone, four pens lie on the desk: one black, one white, one with a dark cap, and one blue. A silver computer mouse is partially visible on the far left. The background consists of a plain, light-colored wall. The lighting is even, suggesting an indoor environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
