  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from an elevated position, a hockey player in a navy blue jersey, wearing number 28, begins in the middle ground, slightly right of center, skating towards the left. The camera, from a high, overhead angle, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire ice rink sharp as it smoothly pans left, tilts up slightly, and zooms in to follow the player. He skillfully maneuvers past defenders in gold jerseys with black and white trim, skating directly toward the opponent's goal. As he approaches the goal, which enters the frame from the left, he shoots the puck past the goalie, distinguished by larger pads and a white mask, scoring a goal. The goal is a red-framed, white-netted hockey goal positioned at one end of the ice. After scoring, the player raises his stick and arms in celebration while skating away from the goal toward the center of the frame. The camera continues its leftward pan to capture this celebration. Other teammates, wearing similar navy blue and red uniforms, skate in from the right and bottom of the frame to join him in the center. One such teammate, with the number 27 visible in white on his navy blue jersey, approaches the main subject during his celebration. The opposing players in gold jerseys skate around their defensive zone. The scene is set in an indoor ice hockey arena, viewed from an elevated, sideline perspective. The rink consists of white ice marked with blue and red lines, enclosed by boards and protective glass covered with various advertisements, including logos for \"Wegmans Market\" and \"Skytop Lodge.\" In the background, spectators are seated in tiered stands, watching the action unfold.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
