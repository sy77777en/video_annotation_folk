  "merged_caption": "The scene unfolds from a first-person perspective, with stylized, pale hands gripping white, curved handlebars in the bottom-center foreground. The hands occasionally shift rapidly between cyan and magenta hues, creating a striking contrast against the dark silhouette of the motorcycle's front end. The camera, slightly unsteady and eye-level, moves steadily forward along a dark path lined with tall, glowing trees that stretch from the foreground into the distant background, creating an illuminated corridor. The ground is black, and the path is flanked by trees exhibiting a range of colors, including pure white, vivid cyan, and deep, darker shades, all illuminated by a deep blue glow with neon pink and cyan highlights. Initially, two other motorcycles are visible in the center middle ground, one operated by a driver wearing a red helmet. As the camera advances, the motorcycles navigate the winding path, and more distant riders become visible. The motorcycle moves forward along a winding path through the dark, stylized forest, following several other motorcycles and navigating left and right turns, as well as uphill and downhill slopes. The viewpoint tilts and sways, simulating the motion of riding over the terrain, with the camera rolling and tilting slightly to create a varying Dutch angle. Transparent, heart-shaped crystalline elements with a soft purple aura appear, colliding with the rider and causing a floating crystal to briefly rise and disappear, while the score in the top-left corner updates to reflect the points gained. Other motorcyclists in the background also interact with these elements, producing the same effect. A score is displayed in a stylized, glowing font with cyan and magenta numerals that change over time, clearly described as part of the overlay element.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot from a slightly unsteady, eye-level, first-person perspective, as if fixed to a motorcycle. The camera moves forward, following the motorcycle's path, and rolls and tilts slightly with the movement, creating a varying Dutch angle that simulates the ride.",
    "Subject": "The video is presented from the first-person perspective of a figure riding a motorcycle, with pale, stylized hands gripping white, curved handlebars. These hands occasionally shift rapidly between cyan and magenta hues, creating a striking contrast against the dark silhouette of the motorcycle's front end. As the rider progresses, additional motorcycles become visible ahead. Initially, there are two motorcycles, one operated by a driver wearing a red helmet. The changing elevation of the route reveals more motorcycles in the distance as the figure ascends uphill. In the top left corner, a score is displayed in a stylized, glowing font with cyan and magenta numerals that change over time.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a motorcycle moves forward along a winding path through a dark, stylized forest. The rider follows several other motorcycles, navigating left and right trucks, as well as uphill and downhill slopes. The viewpoint tilts and sways, simulating the motion of riding over the terrain. The rider's hands, holding the handlebars, periodically flash between cyan and magenta as the motorcycle advances.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, stylized forest at night. The ground is black, and the path is flanked by tall trees exhibiting a range of colors, including pure white, vivid cyan, and deep, darker shades, adding visual diversity. The scene is consistently illuminated by a deep blue glow, with occasional neon pink and cyan highlights on objects and other figures. Transparent, heart-shaped crystalline elements with a soft purple aura occasionally interact with the rider, causing the score display to visibly update. The perspective follows several other figures on similar vehicles as they navigate the winding path through the dense woods. An overlay in the top left corner displays a changing numerical score in a stylized, glowing cyan and pink font, clearly described as part of the overlay element.",
    "Spatial": "The scene unfolds from a first-person perspective, with stylized handlebars and hands in the bottom-center foreground. The camera moves steadily forward along a dark path lined with tall, glowing trees that stretch from the foreground into the distant background, creating an illuminated corridor. Initially, two other motorcycles are visible in the center middle ground, moving away from the camera. As the camera advances, the motorcycles navigate the winding path, and more distant riders become visible. Transparent, heart-shaped crystalline elements with a soft purple aura appear, colliding with the rider and causing a floating crystal to briefly rise and disappear, while the score in the top-left corner updates to reflect the points gained.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
