  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a butterfly with striking black wings adorned with white and light blue spots, perched on vibrant orange and red flowers amidst lush green foliage. Initially, the butterfly is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, with its wings partially open. The flowers and leaves surround it, filling the foreground and background. The butterfly is positioned slightly towards the left side of the frame. The camera is in slow motion, capturing the butterfly collecting nectar, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the butterfly in the midground. The handheld camera slowly and slightly unsteadily moves forward while tilting down, gradually approaching the butterfly. As the video progresses, the butterfly repeatedly opens and closes its wings while remaining on the flowers, occasionally adjusting its position, maintaining its central position. The background is filled with green foliage and more orange and red flowers, creating a lush, vibrant garden scene. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout most of the sequence. Towards the end, the camera shifts to an elevated position, providing a view from above the butterfly, which continues to interact with the flowers. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, with the butterfly as the focal point, surrounded by the colorful flora. The camera's transition from the subject's level to above it subtly alters the perspective, offering a broader view of the scene. The setting is likely during the day, as the lighting is natural and clear, with no visible weather effects, emphasizing the natural beauty of the garden. Some flowers in the garden have already bloomed, while others are still in bud, adding depth to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
