  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man and a woman in the foreground, captured from their level. The man, positioned in the center of the frame, has dark hair and wears a light gray short-sleeved t-shirt with a chest pocket, a black face mask, and a black baseball cap with sunglasses resting on top. He holds a camera and gradually raises the selfie stick for a selfie. The woman, to his left, has blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail and is wearing a dark green tank top with a black bag strap over her shoulder and a blue face mask. She initially turns slightly toward the man, then faces the camera. In the background, a tall, slender waterfall is slightly left of center, cascading white water down a dark, textured rock face into a rocky stream that extends from the foreground to the background. Green foliage occupies both the left side and the upper right side of the scene, with bright yellow leaves prominently visible at the top of the frame. As the camera moves upward while tilting down, the perspective shifts from a level to a high angle, transitioning to a medium shot as the camera moves to a position above the subjects. The surrounding gorge is covered in green moss and other foliage. In the middle ground on the right, another man stands near a small child who is wearing a blue shirt. Other people can be faintly seen in the shaded middle ground and background. The shot captures a scene at the base of the waterfall during the daytime, with deep focus keeping the couple in the foreground and the waterfall in the background sharp.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a scene at the base of a tall, slender waterfall during the daytime. The white water cascades down a dark, textured rock face into a rocky stream below. The surrounding gorge is covered in green moss and other foliage, with bright yellow leaves prominently visible at the top of the frame. In the foreground, a man in a grey shirt and a woman in a green tank top, both wearing face masks, are positioned for the shot. Other people can be faintly seen in the shaded middle ground and background.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man and a woman in the foreground, captured from their level. The man is positioned in the center of the frame, and the woman is to his left. In the background, a tall waterfall is slightly left of center, with a rocky stream extending from the foreground to the background. Green foliage occupies both the left side and the upper right side of the scene. Initially, bright yellow leaves are visible in the top background, which disappear from the top of the frame as the camera ascends. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera moves to a position above the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
