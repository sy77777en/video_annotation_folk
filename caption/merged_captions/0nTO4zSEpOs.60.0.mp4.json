  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a forward-moving, normal-height perspective, looks toward a large staircase under an urban overpass at night. The camera moves forward continuously, slightly unsteady with some shaking, and includes a slight pan to the left at the beginning. Initially, a man with dark hair, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a backpack, walks from the left middle ground toward the foreground and exits the frame on the left. In the center of the middle ground, a wide staircase is the focal point, with several pedestrians descending it, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. Among them, a man in a blue jacket and another in a plaid shirt are visible. A woman in a beige long-sleeved brown dress and dark sneakers also walks forward. The scene is illuminated by lights on the underside of the white concrete and metal structure. The ground is paved with asphalt and marked with a thick yellow line, indicating the path for the visually impaired, running from the bottom center of the frame toward the stairs. The entire scene is framed by the overpass structure at the top and temporary construction walls on the left and right sides, along with several blue signs bearing Japanese text. As the camera moves forward, the perspective dollies in on the staircase and the people on it, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. All pedestrians are wearing face masks, with most in either black or white. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\".",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot where the camera moves forward continuously. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking and includes a slight pan to the left at the beginning. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A group of pedestrians, most wearing either black or white face masks, walk through a pedestrian overpass area at night. A man with dark hair, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a backpack, walks toward the camera. Behind him, a brunette with long hair, dressed in a beige long-sleeved brown dress and dark sneakers, also walks forward. In the midground, several people descend a wide staircase. Among them is a man in a blue jacket and dark pants, and another man behind him wearing a white shirt. Further back, a person is visible wearing a red plaid shirt underneath a blue jacket. Other individuals are visible further up the stairs and in the background.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward under an overpass, approaching a central staircase at night. A person in a white shirt walks from the center of the frame to the left across the foreground and exits the frame. Simultaneously, several other pedestrians, including a woman in a beige outfit and men in blue, plaid, and black shirts, descend the stairs toward the camera. Other people can be seen walking both up and down the stairs in the background.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward at night under a large, modern overpass in an urban area. The scene is illuminated by lights on the underside of the white concrete and metal structure. In the center, a wide set of concrete stairs with metal railings leads up to another level, primarily used by pedestrians, with some ascending and others descending. The ground is paved with asphalt and marked with a thick yellow line, indicating the path for the visually impaired. On either side of the walkway, temporary white walls and construction scaffolding are visible, along with several blue signs bearing Japanese text. All pedestrians are wearing face masks. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
