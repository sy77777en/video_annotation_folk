  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, capturing the main subject, a woman with light brown skin and dark hair pulled back, wearing a blue quarter-zip athletic top with a pink logo on the left chest, from approximately the chest up as she gestures with her right arm. She is positioned in the center foreground, speaking with an animated expression and gesturing forward with her raised right arm. The camera is static at hip level, employing a low angle and a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the woman in blue in the foreground. To her left and in the middle ground, a person with medium skin, a red headband, and a pink top with a separate blue garment draped over their shoulder is visible, standing with their arms crossed. Another partially seen individual with medium skin in a pink top is positioned between them and the main subject. To the main subject's right and also in the middle ground, a person with light brown skin, curly dark hair, and a red top is present, looking towards the main subject. All three appear to be listening attentively to the woman in the blue top. The scene is set indoors, in a room with light-colored, possibly cinder block walls, forming the background. The lighting, which includes a noticeable source off-camera to the left, creates a somewhat stark atmosphere. An earring is visible in the main subject's left ear, adding a subtle detail to her appearance.",

    "Motion": "The woman in the blue top speaks, gesturing forward with her raised right arm. To her far left, two individuals stand; one with crossed arms and another next to them, both appearing to listen attentively. To her far right, a third person also looks towards her, similarly engaged.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a room with light-colored, possibly cinder block walls. A central figure, wearing a blue quarter-zip jacket with a pink logo on the chest, is positioned in the foreground, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. Several other individuals are visible in the background, some wearing red or blue tops. The lighting, which includes a noticeable source off-camera to the left, creates a somewhat stark atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
