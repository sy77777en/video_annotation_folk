  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, focusing on a large-scale weather event. A massive supercell storm cloud dominates the majority of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background. The time-lapse video captures the dramatic formation and movement of the storm, with grey, turbulent clouds swirling and churning rapidly across the sky. A dense curtain of heavy precipitation extends downward from the cloud base in the background, spanning from the center-right to the center of the frame, sweeping across the distant landscape. The foreground and middle ground are composed of a flat plain that fills the bottom portion of the frame, consisting of a wide expanse of brownish-yellow fields. In the background, a brighter, white-yellowish sky is visible on both the left and right sides, just above the horizon, contrasting sharply with the ominous darkness of the storm. The time-lapse shows the storm cloud formation rotating and gradually moving from right to left across the scene, with the curtain of precipitation sweeping across the landscape in unison. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the storm, and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp. It performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left across the scene, emphasizing the immense scale of the natural phenomenon. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object, capturing the powerful storm as it develops over the flat, open prairie.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a massive storm cloud formation, shot from a camera positioned between eye-level and overhead-level. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp, and performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left across the scene.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event over a flat, open plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object, emphasizing the immense scale of the natural phenomenon. A massive, grey, and turbulent supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, appearing to rotate slowly as it looms over the landscape. A dense, grey curtain of heavy precipitation falls from the base of the storm. The ground is a vast, brownish-yellow field that stretches out flatly, while a brighter, yellowish light is visible above the horizon on both sides, contrasting sharply with the ominous darkness of the storm.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a powerful storm. This time-lapse video captures the dramatic formation and movement of a massive supercell thunderstorm. The grey, turbulent clouds swirl and churn rapidly across the sky as a heavy downpour falls from the base of the storm over the flat plains.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse shows a massive, rotating supercell thunderstorm developing over a flat, open prairie. Turbulent grey clouds dominate the sky, swirling in a large, ominous formation. Below the main cloud base, a dense curtain of heavy precipitation descends to the ground, sweeping across the distant landscape. The ground consists of a wide expanse of brownish-yellow fields, with the flat horizon visible across the bottom of the frame. A brighter, white-yellowish sky is visible on both sides above the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
