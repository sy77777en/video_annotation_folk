  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, where the right portion of a large, black, cylindrical object resembling a bomb or missile is positioned in the center of the frame, extending towards the left in the foreground. The object has a semi-circular nose at one end and a tail section that tapers inward in a conical shape before connecting to a square housing structure. The body is segmented, with visible lines of rivets or fasteners marking the seams between sections. Below it, a metallic stand with a highly reflective surface is visible in the center-bottom, also in the foreground, supported by four curved, metallic arms. The background is out of focus, suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or workshop setting. The camera is at eye level, initially at a high angle, then transitioning to a level angle as it moves backward while panning left to reveal the entire model of the bomb. The movement is very smooth. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus on the bomb model in the foreground. As the camera pulls back to a full shot, the entire cylindrical object is horizontally centered in the foreground, with its semi-circular nose on the right and its squared-off tail section on the left. The metallic stand remains in the center-bottom, in the foreground, supporting the object. The scene is dimly lit, with a focused light source illuminating the top surface of the black object, creating a sheen. In the bottom left corner, white subtitles display the numbers \"[8,10,22,23].\" The large, black, cylindrical object remains stationary throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "A large, black, cylindrical object, resembling a bomb or missile, is shown horizontally. It has a semi-circular nose at one end and a tail section that tapers inward in a conical shape before connecting to a square housing structure. The body of the object is segmented, with visible lines of rivets or fasteners marking the seams between sections. It is supported by four curved, metallic arms that extend upwards from a flat, metallic base with a highly reflective surface.",
    "Motion": "The large, black, cylindrical object remains stationary, supported by four metallic arms.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a medium shot of a black, cylindrical object resembling a bomb or torpedo, resting horizontally on a metallic silver stand. As the camera pulls back to a full shot, the object is shown with visible rivets along its seams and a semi-circular nose. At the rear, a fin or stabilizer is partially visible. The stand features a base with rounded edges and several curved metal supports cradling the object. The scene is dimly lit, with a focused light source illuminating the top surface of the black object, creating a sheen. The background is out of focus, suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or workshop setting. In the bottom left corner, white subtitles display the numbers \"[8,10,22,23].\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, where the right portion of a black, cylindrical object is positioned in the center of the frame, extending towards the left, in the foreground. Below it, a metallic stand is visible in the center-bottom, also in the foreground. The background is out of focus. The camera then moves backward while panning to the left, transitioning to a full shot. In this final framing, the entire cylindrical object is horizontally centered in the foreground, with its semi-circular nose on the right and its squared-off tail section on the left. The metallic stand remains in the center-bottom, in the foreground, supporting the object. The camera is at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
