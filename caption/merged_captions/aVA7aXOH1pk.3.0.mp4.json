  "merged_caption": "A wide shot, filmed from a low angle, captures several men disembarking from a large, dark-colored airplane at night. The aircraft's tail, featuring a prominent, waving American flag, is positioned in the top-center of the frame in the middle ground. A set of illuminated mobile stairs extends diagonally from the top right towards the bottom left, occupying the foreground and middle ground. The men, initially at the top of the stairs in the middle ground, walk down towards the bottom left of the frame as they descend. The primary subject, a light-skinned man with dark, very short hair, wearing a dark blue suit, a white collared shirt, and a blue tie, is centrally framed on the stairs, following another light-skinned man in a dark suit and tie. A third man in a suit is visible behind the man with light-colored hair, and another person is partially visible at the top of the stairs near the plane's entrance. The camera, from a low, eye-level angle, looks up at the men disembarking from the plane. The shot is static but slightly unsteady, with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The scene is lit by the lights on the stairs and from within the plane's open doorway. A watermark reading \"[1,6];x.com / @margonmarin\" is visible in the bottom-left corner.",

    "Subject": "Several men are seen disembarking from a dark-colored airplane at night. The plane has a large, waving American flag painted on its tail. A light-skinned man with dark, very short hair, wearing a dark blue suit, a white collared shirt, and a blue tie, walks down the lit stairs. Preceding him is another light-skinned man in a dark suit and tie. A third man in a suit is visible behind the man with light-colored hair, and another person is partially visible at the top of the stairs near the plane's entrance.",
    "Motion": "Several men in suits descend a set of stairs from an airplane in a single file line. A man in a dark suit leads the way down the stairs, followed closely by a second man with light-colored hair, who is in turn followed by a third man, all walking down from the plane.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
