  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape, captured from a static, low-angle position. A snow-covered plain occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the bottom foreground to the line of dark coniferous trees in the background. In the bottom left, some lit buildings are situated in the middle ground, with plumes of steam rising from them. A line of trees forms the horizon in the background, stretching across the scene. The upper portion of the frame is dominated by the green aurora borealis, which appears as broad bands of light stretching across the sky and receding into the background. In a time-lapse effect, these bands of light shift and flow across the sky, dancing and swirling in vibrant green hues. Stars are visible in the darker sky on the right, and two small red lights are positioned in the center-left, just above the background treeline. This is a static, time-lapse video shot from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the snowy landscape and buildings to the aurora-filled sky, sharp and clear. The luminous, curtain-like bands of the aurora borealis dominate the star-dusted night sky, appearing to stretch across the entire frame and disappear in the far distant sky on the left. Below, a flat, expansive snow-covered landscape is sparsely populated with small, brightly lit white buildings that emit plumes of white steam or smoke. The snow-covered landscape extends from the bottom foreground to the line of dark coniferous trees in the background. In the middle ground, a single-story white building with illuminated windows has a plume of white steam rising near it. The vibrant green lights dance and swirl across the starry night sky above a snow-covered landscape with several buildings and a coniferous forest in the distance.",

    "Scene": "At night, a vibrant green aurora borealis fills the sky with broad, shifting curtains of light over a vast, snow-covered landscape. The snow-covered landscape extends from the bottom foreground to the line of dark coniferous trees in the background. In the middle ground, a single-story white building with illuminated windows has a plume of white steam rising near it. A line of dark coniferous trees stands on the horizon, with two distant red lights visible just above them. Stars are visible in the dark portions of the sky not obscured by the aurora.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
