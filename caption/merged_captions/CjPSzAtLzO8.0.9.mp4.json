  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a person wearing full motorcycle racing gear, including a blue and white helmet with green accents and a dark blue racing suit paired with black and white boots, riding a blue racing motorcycle with red and white graphics. The motorcycle, featuring sponsor logos like \"DELL Technologies\" and \"TRIUMPH,\" is positioned in the center of the frame as it navigates a left-hand turn on a paved racetrack. The track curves from the bottom left to the right, ending in the top center, with a black-and-yellow checkered curb in the middle ground and a dry, light-brown dirt landscape in the background. Bright sunlight casts a distinct shadow on the dark gray asphalt. The camera, a drone shot with a fixed Dutch tilt, begins at an overhead level and rapidly moves forward and downward, descending to hip level as it tracks the motorcycle from behind. As the motorcycle leans sharply into the curve, the camera moves closer, transitioning into a full shot at the subject's level. In this final framing, the motorcycle and rider fill the center of the frame, with the rear wheel in the bottom center foreground, as the camera tracks alongside them. The movement is very smooth, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp as the motorcyclist grows larger in the frame.",

    "Camera": "This drone shot captures a motorcyclist on a racetrack from a high angle with a fixed Dutch tilt. The camera begins at an overhead level and rapidly moves forward and downward, descending to hip level as it tracks the motorcycle from behind. The movement is very smooth, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp as the motorcyclist grows larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A person is shown wearing full motorcycle racing gear, including a blue and white helmet with green accents and a dark blue racing suit paired with black and white boots. They are riding a racing motorcycle that is primarily blue with red and white graphics. The motorcycle features various sponsor logos, including \"DELL Technologies\" and \"TRIUMPH,\" along with other logos that are not clearly identifiable. The bike has black wheels and is leaning sharply into a turn.",
    "Motion": "A person on a racing motorcycle navigates a left-hand turn on a racetrack, leaning sharply into the curve. As the motorcycle continues through the turn, the camera moves closer to the motorcycle.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a scene on a paved racetrack during the daytime. The dark gray asphalt of the track is bordered by a black-and-yellow checkered curb, which separates it from the surrounding dry, light-brown dirt landscape. Bright sunlight casts a distinct shadow on the pavement as the camera follows a blue, red, and white motorcycle navigating a wide, sweeping turn.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a motorcycle positioned in the center of the frame as it navigates a turn on a racetrack. The track curves from the bottom left to the right, ending in the top center, with a checkered curb in the middle ground and a dirt landscape in the background. The camera then moves towards the motorcycle as it descends, transitioning into a full shot at the subject's level. In this final framing, the motorcycle and rider fill the center of the frame, with the rear wheel in the bottom center foreground, as the camera tracks alongside them."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
