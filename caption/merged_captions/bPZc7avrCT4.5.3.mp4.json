  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a teal long-sleeved top and black leggings, stands in the center of the frame in the foreground on an asphalt road in a residential area, bordered by a grassy curb. She holds a large, teal water balloon in the center of the frame and drops it downwards toward a tan-colored drum with a silver rim and a yellowish-green drumhead positioned directly in front of her. As the balloon falls, it remains in the foreground, moving directly towards the drum. Upon impact with the drumhead, the balloon bursts, sending a large, foamy splash of white water erupting upwards and outwards, momentarily occupying the lower half of the frame. The woman's facial expression is slightly contorted due to exertion as she remains standing while the water splashes. In the background, a road recedes, bordered by a line of green trees standing before a partly cloudy sky, with a chain-link fence visible in the distance. The camera remains stationary at a level, hip-height angle throughout the shot, featuring a speed ramp effect that transitions from slow motion to an even slower motion, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the woman and the drum in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to an even slower motion. The static camera is positioned at a level, hip-height angle, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the woman and the drum in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a teal long-sleeved top and black leggings, stands outdoors. She holds a large, teal water balloon with both hands and then drops it toward a drum positioned on the ground in front of her. The drum has a tan-colored body, a silver rim, and a yellowish-green drumhead. As the balloon falls, the woman's facial expression is slightly contorted due to exertion. Upon impact with the drum, the balloon bursts, sending a large splash of white, foamy water upwards.",
    "Motion": "A woman drops a large, teal water balloon, which falls toward a drum on the ground. Upon striking the drumhead, the balloon bursts, sending a large, foamy splash of water erupting upwards and outwards. The woman remains standing as the water splashes.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds on an asphalt road in a residential area, bordered by a grassy curb. In the background, a line of green trees stands before a partly cloudy sky, with a chain-link fence visible in the distance. Positioned in the foreground on the pavement is a tan-colored drum with a yellow-green rim. A turquoise water balloon is dropped onto the drum, bursting upon impact and sending a white, frothy splash of water into the air.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a woman stands in the center of the frame in the foreground, with a drum positioned directly in front of her on an asphalt road. She holds a water balloon in the center of the frame and drops it downwards toward the drum. As the balloon falls, it remains in the foreground, moving directly towards the drum. Upon impact, the balloon bursts, and a splash of water erupts upwards and outwards from the drum's central position, momentarily occupying the lower half of the frame. In the background, a road recedes, bordered by trees. The camera remains stationary at the woman's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
