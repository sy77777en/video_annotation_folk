  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a worm's-eye angle perspective, looking up from the bottom of the frame. Two towering buildings extend from the lower left and upper right corners toward the center, rendered in deep, imposing silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. Intricate, dark metal fire escapes and balconies cling to the sides of the buildings, creating a dense, geometric pattern that enhances the feeling of a claustrophobic urban canyon. The camera smoothly rolls clockwise, capturing the silhouettes of the two towering buildings and their fire escapes against the sky. As the camera performs this slow rolling movement, the buildings occupy the top and bottom of the frame, leaving only a small gap in the middle that reveals the sky. The dark facades of the buildings create a canyon-like enclosure, with intricate black metal fire escapes forming a complex, cage-like pattern in the foreground. The building on the right shows a faint grid of windows, but both structures are mostly obscured by shadow. The vertical lines of the buildings and the gap of sky shift their composition from the top left to the bottom right, transitioning to a composition from the top right to the bottom left. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. There is no main subject; the focus is instead on conveying the overwhelming scale and oppressive atmosphere of the dense city environment, emphasizing the feeling of being dwarfed by the architecture. The scene remains mostly still throughout the clip, with the camera's rolling motion being the primary dynamic element.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a worm's eye view looking straight up from a narrow space between two towering buildings. The structures are rendered in deep, imposing silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. Intricate, dark metal fire escapes and balconies cling to the sides of the buildings, creating a dense, geometric pattern that enhances the feeling of a claustrophobic urban canyon. There is no main subject; the focus is instead on conveying the overwhelming scale and oppressive atmosphere of the dense city environment, emphasizing the feeling of being dwarfed by the architecture.",
    "Motion": "This is a worm's-eye view shot looking straight up from a dark alleyway. The camera rotates clockwise, capturing the silhouettes of two towering buildings and their fire escapes against a sliver of pale, overcast sky. The scene remains mostly still throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "From a worm's eye view looking straight up from a narrow urban alley, two towering buildings are cast in deep silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. The dark facades of the buildings create a canyon-like enclosure. Intricate black metal fire escapes, with their platforms and railings, run up the sides of the buildings, forming a complex, cage-like pattern in the foreground. The building on the right shows a faint grid of windows, but both structures are mostly obscured by shadow. The camera rolls clockwise, causing the perspective of the tall buildings to shift.",
    "Spatial": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a worm's-eye angle perspective, looking up from the bottom of the frame. Two towering buildings extend from the lower left and upper right corners toward the center. As the camera performs a slow rolling clockwise movement, they occupy the top and bottom of the frame, leaving only a small gap in the middle that reveals the sky. Dark, intricate fire escapes are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, attached to the building initially on the left. They occupy both the lower and upper portions initially. The vertical lines of the buildings and the gap of sky shift their composition from the top left to the bottom right, transitioning to a composition from the top right to the bottom left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
