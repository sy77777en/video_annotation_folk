  "merged_caption": "This is a dynamic, first-person point-of-view shot filmed from hip level. In the foreground, a pair of light-skinned, bare feet are positioned in the bottom center of the frame, resting on a white duvet that occupies the lower portion of the scene. The person's legs are covered by dark blue sweatpants. An ornate black metal footboard with brass-colored finials is situated in the center of the frame in the middle ground. Flanking the bed on the far left and right are two large wooden posts, each with a wall sconce emitting a warm, orange light. In the background, a wooden railing is visible behind the footboard, suggesting a loft setting. The top half of the frame features a high, vaulted ceiling with exposed wooden beams and six large skylights, allowing daylight to enter the otherwise dimly lit space. The camera begins at a level angle and then smoothly tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle view of the ceiling, with slight movement of the feet. The video appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect.",

    "Camera": "This point-of-view shot is filmed from hip level. The camera begins at a level angle and then smoothly tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle view of the ceiling. The video appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned, bare feet are visible at the end of a bed, propped up on a white duvet. The person's legs are covered by dark blue sweatpants. The view looks past the feet towards an ornate, black metal footboard with brass-colored finials. Above, a vaulted ceiling with exposed wooden beams features six skylight windows. On the wooden posts flanking the bed, wall sconces emit a warm, orange light.",
    "Motion": "The video offers a first-person view from a bed, where a pair of feet is visible. While the scene is mostly still, there is a slight upward tilt of the camera and minor movement in the feet.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from a bed in a room with a high, vaulted ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. Six large skylights are set into the ceiling, allowing daylight to enter the otherwise dimly lit space. The ornate, black metal footboard of the bed, featuring brass-colored finials, is positioned in the center of the view. On either side, large wooden posts are fitted with wall sconces that cast a warm, orange glow. A pair of bare feet rest on the white bedding at the bottom of the scene, and a wooden railing is visible in the background, suggesting a loft setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
