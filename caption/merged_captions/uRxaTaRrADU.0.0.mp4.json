  "merged_caption": "A young woman with long brown hair, dressed as a ballerina in a white, high-neck, sleeveless dress and pointe shoes, is captured in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground on an outdoor staircase at night. The scene is dramatically lit by a single spotlight from above, creating a high-contrast effect that illuminates her form against the surrounding darkness. She holds onto the metal railing, which runs diagonally from the bottom center to the top right, for support. The camera, at eye level with a shallow depth of field, keeps her in focus as it performs a slow, smooth clockwise arc around her, adding a dynamic element to the scene. As she maintains her balance with the railing, she lifts her left leg vertically into a standing split, using her left hand to hold her foot high in the air, with her raised foot moving towards the upper center of the frame. The background is mostly obscured by the darkness, with a few distant, out-of-focus streetlights visible, enhancing the dramatic atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the woman in the foreground in focus. The camera performs a slow, smooth clockwise arc around her.",
    "Subject": "A young woman with long brown hair, dressed as a ballerina in a white, high-neck, sleeveless dress and pointe shoes, is on a staircase at night. She uses the metal railing for support as she gracefully performs a standing split, lifting her left leg vertically and holding her foot with her hand. The scene is dramatically lit by a single spotlight from above, which illuminates her form against the surrounding darkness, with some streetlights visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "A woman in a white dress and pointe shoes, positioned on a staircase at night, holds onto the metal railing. She then lifts her left leg vertically into a standing split, using her left hand to hold her foot high in the air while maintaining her balance with the railing.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor staircase is shown at night, enveloped in darkness. The scene is illuminated by a single, bright overhead light that casts a focused beam from above, creating a high-contrast effect. The staircase features a series of parallel metal railings that recede into the dark background. A woman in a white dress is standing on the stairs, holding onto the railing. The camera moves in a subtle, smooth clockwise arc, adding a dynamic element to the scene. In the background, the environment is mostly obscured by the darkness, with a few distant, out-of-focus lights visible.",
    "Spatial": "A woman is captured in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground. A metal staircase railing runs diagonally from the bottom center to the top right, which she holds for support. The background is dark. She lifts her left leg vertically into a standing split, with her raised foot moving towards the upper center of the frame. The camera remains at her level throughout the action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
