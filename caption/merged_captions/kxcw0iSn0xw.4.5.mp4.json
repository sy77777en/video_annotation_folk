  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a man in a light blue t-shirt and a red and grey baseball cap on the right foreground, with a large, colorful exercise ball pressed against the side of his head in the center foreground. The ball, predominantly turquoise with a gradient of pink, compresses and then rebounds away, causing the man's head to snap back and up. As the ball flies up and out of the frame towards the top left, the man looks upward. The hands of a second man, located on the left edge of the frame, become more visible as he stands to the side, smiling and watching the action unfold. The scene is set outdoors during the day in a paved area, possibly a basketball court, bordered by a low, tan stone retaining wall and a lawn. In the middle ground, a basketball hoop with a clear backboard outlined in white and a red rim is positioned in front of a line of bare-branched trees and a parked white pickup truck. To the right, a small, colorful pinwheel is stuck in the ground. The weather is clear and sunny. The video features a speed ramp effect, alternating between fast and slow motion, and is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady camera positioned at a level, eye-level angle. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the man in the foreground in sharp focus. The scene captures a moment of fun and camaraderie between the two men as they interact with the ball, with the round shape of the exercise ball contrasting with the angular lines of the basketball hoop in the background.",

    "Subject": "The video features two young men engaged in a playful interaction with a large, colorful exercise ball. One man, wearing a light blue t-shirt and a red and grey baseball cap, is positioned in the foreground, with the ball airborne and making contact with his face. He has short, light brown hair and a light skin tone. The second man is located on the left edge of the frame, facing the first man directly and smiling, suggesting a lighthearted moment. The exercise ball is predominantly turquoise with a gradient of pink, and its round shape contrasts with the angular lines of the basketball hoop in the background. The scene captures a moment of fun and camaraderie between the two men as they interact with the ball.",
    "Motion": "A large, colorful exercise ball, initially compressed against the side of a man's head, rebounds away. The force of the rebound causes the man's head to snap back and up. He then looks upward as the ball flies up and out of the frame. A second man stands to the side, watching the action unfold.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors during the day in a paved area, possibly a basketball court, bordered by a low, tan stone retaining wall and a lawn. In the background, a basketball hoop with a clear backboard outlined in white and a red rim is visible in front of a line of bare-branched trees and a parked white pickup truck. A large, inflatable exercise ball with a turquoise and pink tie-dye pattern is shown compressing and then flying up into the air, striking a man wearing a blue shirt and a backward baseball cap in the face before bouncing back. To the right, a small, colorful pinwheel is stuck in the ground. The weather is clear and sunny.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a man in a blue shirt on the right foreground, with a large exercise ball pressed against the side of his head in the center foreground. The hands of a second man are visible on the far left foreground. In the middle ground, a low stone wall runs horizontally, with a basketball hoop positioned in front of it towards the center, and trees in the background. The man on the right then throws his head back, causing the ball to bounce upwards towards the top left, remaining in the foreground. The second man on the left becomes more visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
