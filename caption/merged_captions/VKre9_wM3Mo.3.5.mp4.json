  "merged_caption": "A full, high-angle shot captures a modern, siphonic toilet positioned prominently in the foreground, set against a solid black background. The toilet is constructed from a translucent, frosted material, with its lid raised to an open position, revealing a white seat. The interior of the toilet bowl emits a bright, cyan-blue glow, illuminating the fixture from within. A faint reflection of the glowing toilet is visible on the glossy surface directly beneath it. The camera performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around the toilet, maintaining a high, eye-level angle and keeping the toilet sharply in focus against the completely black background. The toilet remains stationary throughout the video. In the bottom left corner, an overlay displays the text \"siphonic toilet\" in white, with \"Diego Cumplido - Zizek on toilets (2011)\" written in smaller text underneath.",

The bowl of the toilet emits a bright cyan glow, which is reflected on the glossy black surface below.

The camera performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around the toilet, enhancing the dynamic composition. A reflection of the toilet is visible on the glossy surface directly beneath it.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
