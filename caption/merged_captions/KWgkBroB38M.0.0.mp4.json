  "merged_caption": "This close-up video begins from a high angle, showing a person's hands in the bottom left foreground holding a square, thin object that occupies the center of the frame. The object has a black frame and emits a bright cyan glow from an internal light source, creating a tunnel-like illusion of infinitely receding, nested squares. To the right of the object, in the foreground, a black, rectangular AC/DC power adapter with a label rests on a white tabletop. The camera captures this scene from a high-angle, eye-level perspective with deep focus, beginning as a shaky static view. The person's hands hold the lit, thin square frame and then take their hands back, tapping the square surface. The camera rolls slightly clockwise and moves closer to the object, with the movement being unsteady and noticeable shaking throughout. As the hands exit the frame, the adapter is pushed out of view. The camera continues to rotate clockwise and moves toward the object, highlighting the tunnel-like illusion created by the receding, cyan-lit squares. Eventually, the infinity tunnel-like illusion fills the entire frame, creating a centered, direct view into the illusion of receding cyan squares. Indoors, on a white tabletop, the device illuminates to reveal an infinity mirror effect, with glowing cyan-colored squares appearing to recede into the distance, creating the illusion of a deep, luminous tunnel.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, eye-level perspective, a handheld camera with deep focus captures a square, thin object on a table that creates an illusion of a deep hole with glowing blue light patterns. The shot begins as a shaky static view before the camera rolls slightly clockwise and moves closer to the object. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "Subject": "A person's hands, emerging from the sleeves of a dark jacket, are shown with a lit-up thin object. The object has a black frame and emits a bright cyan glow from an internal light source, creating a tunnel-like illusion of infinitely receding, nested squares. Lying on the white surface next to the object is a black, rectangular AC/DC power adapter with a label.",
    "Motion": "A person's hands hold a lit, thin square frame. The person takes their hands back. The camera then rolls clockwise and moves toward the center of the frame to highlight the tunnel-like illusion created by the receding, cyan-lit squares.",
    "Scene": "Indoors, on a white tabletop, a person handles a square, black-framed object. The device illuminates to reveal an infinity mirror effect. Glowing cyan-colored squares appear to recede into the distance, creating the illusion of a deep, luminous tunnel. The power adapter and its coiled black cable lie on the table beside the lit mirror.",

To the right of the object, in the foreground, a black power adapter rests on a white tabletop. The camera then rotates clockwise and moves toward the object while the hands tap the square surface and exit the frame, pushing the adapter out of view until the infinity tunnel-like illusion fills the entire frame, creating a centered, direct view into the illusion of receding cyan squares."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
