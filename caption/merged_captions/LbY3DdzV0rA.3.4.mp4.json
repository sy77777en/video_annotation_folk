  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from an elevated viewpoint looking across a vast, arid landscape during the daytime. The time-lapse video greatly accelerates the movement of a massive storm cloud system developing over the desert. A narrow, dry strip extends into the distance across the lower eighth of the frame, with a paved road situated on the bottom right, stretching toward the horizon. The majority of the frame is dominated by a massive cloud bank, where a white cloud rolls from left to right above, while a dark storm cloud moves from right to left below. These clouds converge in the center of the frame, where a distinct rain band descends beneath them, sweeping across the distant plains. The dark clouds gather in the distance, forming a curtain of rain, while the white clouds above, illuminated by the sun, continue to move, creating a dynamic interplay with the dark storm clouds below. A patch of blue sky is visible in the top left background, and a faint mountain range can be seen on the far left horizon. In the time-lapse, the storm cloud churns and expands, moving across the frame in unison with the rain band. A concentrated shaft of heavy rain visibly descends from the cloud base onto the vast, arid plain below, which is colored in shades of yellow and green with sparse vegetation. The scene is captured from a low-angle, overhead level perspective, and the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp while performing a slow, smooth pan from left to right across the scene. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject, emphasizing the sheer size of the powerful weather event.",

    "Subject": "This video is a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A massive storm system dominates the frame, with its bright, sunlit white tops contrasting against a dark, menacing grey underbelly that churns and expands across the sky. A concentrated shaft of heavy rain visibly descends from the cloud base onto the vast, arid plain below, which is colored in shades of yellow and green with sparse vegetation. In the far distance, a faint mountain range sits on the horizon, and a paved road cuts through the landscape on the right, further emphasizing the sheer size of the powerful weather event.",

    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a dramatic weather event over a vast, arid landscape during the daytime. A massive, churning storm cloud dominates the sky, its upper portions bright white against a patch of blue sky, while its base is a dark, menacing grey. A concentrated column of heavy rain falls from the center of the cloud, hitting the distant, flat plain. The landscape below is a mix of dry, yellow-brown earth and sparse green vegetation. A paved road is visible on the right, stretching toward the horizon, and a faint mountain range can be seen in the far distance on the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
