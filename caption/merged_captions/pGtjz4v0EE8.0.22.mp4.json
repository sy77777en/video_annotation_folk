  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape, featuring a historic town with prominent towers positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the background atop a hill. The rolling green hills and vineyards extend from the foreground to the background, providing a continuous view of the landscape, with distinct rows of vineyards visible in the bottom left. The top portion of the frame is occupied by a blue sky with clouds, which serves as the background for the town's skyline. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking across the landscape toward the town, and performs a smooth zoom-out, adding dynamic movement to the scene. Additionally, the landscape is not entirely static, as the clouds are visibly moving across the sky. This is a time-lapse video, shot from a smooth, aerial-level camera at a level angle. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp as the camera zooms out from the town on the hill. The video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a picturesque view of the Italian countryside. Rolling green hills, patterned with what appear to be vineyards and dotted with lush trees, seamlessly extend from the foreground into the distant background under a vast blue sky with scattered white clouds. Perched atop a distant hill is a historic walled town, its skyline uniquely defined by a cluster of tall, slender stone towers. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the entire scene, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the ancient settlement. The scene is set during a clear, sunny day, and the camera zooms out from a distance, causing the hilltop town to gradually appear smaller, while the clouds move quickly across the sky, adding dynamic movement to the scene.",

    "Motion": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a historic town, likely San Gimignano in Tuscany, Italy, perched on a lush, green hill. The town's skyline is defined by its numerous medieval towers, and it is surrounded by a classic landscape of rolling hills, vineyards, and forests under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds.

    "Scene": "An extreme wide shot captures a historic town perched atop a hill, surrounded by a lush, green landscape. The town is characterized by numerous tall, square stone towers that create a distinct skyline against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The rolling hills extend from the foreground into the background, covered in fields, some of which are organized into the neat rows of vineyards, interspersed with patches of trees. The scene is set during a clear, sunny day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
