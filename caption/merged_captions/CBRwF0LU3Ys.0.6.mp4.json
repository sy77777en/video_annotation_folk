  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a high-angle wide shot, placing a red and white SUV with a half-blue, half-red roof in the center middle ground as it drifts sideways around a curve on a snow-covered road. The driver's door displays \"30°\" in red within a white circle, along with other designs and text that are not visible in the video. As the SUV slides through the turn, its tires kick up a large, thick plume of snow that trails behind and partially envelops the rear of the vehicle. In the top-right background, a camp tent is visible further down the path. The camera, from a high, aerial perspective with a varying Dutch angle, tracks the car drifting in the snow. It glides right and forward while tilting down, then smoothly arcs clockwise in a descent. During this motion, the camera gradually tilts upward, transitioning from a high angle to a level, eye-level view as it approaches the car, which grows larger in the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire snowy landscape sharp. The scene is set in a vast, snow-covered landscape during the daytime, with a winding track carved through the deep white snow, bordered in the distance by a sparse forest of evergreen trees. The low sun casts a bright glare across the scene. As the shot progresses, the SUV remains in the center of the frame, moving away from its initial position while becoming increasingly obscured by the large cloud of snow it kicks up behind it.",

    "Subject": "A red and white SUV with a half-blue, half-red roof is seen from a high angle as it drifts around a curve on a snow-covered road. The vehicle kicks up a large, thick plume of white snow, which partially envelops its rear. The driver's door displays \"30°\" in red within a white circle, along with other designs and text that are not visible in the video. In the background, further down the road, a camp tent is located on the right side.",
    "Motion": "From a high angle, an SUV drifts sideways around a curve on a snow-covered road. As it slides through the turn, its tires kick up a large, thick plume of snow that trails behind and partially envelops the rear of the vehicle as it continues its motion.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in a vast, snow-covered landscape during the daytime. A winding track is carved through the deep white snow, bordered in the distance by a sparse forest of evergreen trees. The low sun casts a bright glare across the scene. A vehicle drifts around a curve on the track, kicking up a large, dense cloud of powdered snow that follows in its wake. Further down the curved path, a tent is visible in the background.",
    "Spatial": "This video begins with a high-angle wide shot, placing a white SUV with red and blue accents in the center middle ground as it drifts around a curve on a snow-covered road. In the top-right background, a tent is visible further down the path. The camera moves right and forward while tilting down, then smoothly arcs clockwise in a descent. During this motion, the camera gradually tilts upward to a level angle, closer to the subject's level. As the shot progresses, the SUV remains in the center of the frame, moving away from its initial position while becoming increasingly obscured by the large cloud of snow it kicks up behind it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
