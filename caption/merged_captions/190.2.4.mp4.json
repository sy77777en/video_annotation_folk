  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a man wearing a brown hat with a darker brown or black band, sunglasses, and a brown jacket, who occupies most of the frame. He has a goatee and is holding a silver object near his face. Positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left, he stands on a tree-lined street with brick buildings in the background, suggesting an urban environment. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the man, while the urban street and buildings form the background. The environment is calm, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the sidewalk. Initially, the man faces slightly to the side, closely examining the silver object. He then raises his hand to pull down the brim of his hat. After adjusting his hat, he turns around and starts walking away from the camera. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, revealing more of his upper body, which shifts toward the bottom right of the frame. The man moves toward the center of the frame, with the street extending into the background. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, staying at his height and capturing his movement along the sidewalk. In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind, walking away down the tree-lined street. The buildings have a classic architectural style, with visible windows, and the street is lined with greenery, including bushes and trees, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. The overall atmosphere is serene, with no visible traffic or bustling activity, emphasizing the quiet nature of the neighborhood.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
