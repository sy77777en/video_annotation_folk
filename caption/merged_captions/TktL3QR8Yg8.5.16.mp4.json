  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a first-person point-of-view close-up, where a pair of light-skinned hands in a grey knitted sweater is positioned in the lower-middle part of the frame, occupying the foreground. These hands use the thumbs to press down and rotate a dark red circular dial clockwise on a complex, circular mechanism at the center of the frame, set against a dark, chaotic background of sharp, fragmented pieces. The device has a reddish-brown center with several small holes, encircled by petal-shaped metal pieces. The video employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the circular device throughout. As the hands interact with the ornate mechanism, the dark grey, petal-like segments quickly flip over to reveal their original bright, reflective gold color on the reverse side, unveiling a colorful, stained-glass-like pattern in the background behind the fragments. The original metal hooks on the outermost edge retract inward, and golden arc-shaped metal pieces emerge, distributing evenly around the device's periphery. The transformation completes with the entire flower-shaped mechanism shining in bright, reflective gold, while the background illuminates, enhancing the visual impact. After the hands exit the frame, the dial lock remains the central focus. The shot maintains a smooth, eye-level perspective with a level angle, and the camera subtly dollies out from the ornate mechanical device in the midground, effectively capturing its intricate details. Thin, curved wires extend from the perimeter of the central disc, which remains reddish-brown. A few small, colored lights are visible in the background, adding to the scene's complexity.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands in a grey knitted sweater manipulates a dark red circular dial. This dial is surrounded by a petal-like design made of dark grey metal with swirling filigree patterns. After the hands are removed, each metal segment quickly flips over to reveal its original bright, reflective gold color on the reverse side, while the central red dial remains unchanged.",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands uses the thumbs to press down and rotate the central red dial clockwise on a dark, ornate mechanism. This action triggers the dark grey, petal-like segments to flip over rapidly, revealing their golden undersides. As the transformation progresses, the original metal hooks on the outermost edge retract inward, and golden arc-shaped metal pieces emerge, distributing evenly around the device's periphery. The transformation completes with the entire flower-shaped mechanism shining in bright, reflective gold, while the background illuminates, enhancing the visual impact.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, focuses on a pair of hands interacting with a complex, circular mechanism. The device has a reddish-brown center with several small holes, encircled by petal-shaped metal pieces. These pieces, initially a dark, gunmetal gray, quickly flip to reveal their original gold color on the reverse side. Thin, curved wires extend from the perimeter of the central disc, which remains reddish-brown. This central object is set against a dark, chaotic background of sharp, fragmented pieces, with a few small, colored lights visible. As the petal-shaped pieces reveal their gold color, a colorful, stained-glass-like pattern is revealed behind the fragments.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
