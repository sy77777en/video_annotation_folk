  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, initially capturing a quiet Japanese street that recedes from the bottom center into the background. Traditional two-story buildings with wooden and beige exteriors and tiled roofs line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background, with a lush green hill visible in the distant background against a clear blue sky. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, moves forward along the street while simultaneously panning to the right, capturing a scenic view of the serene and unchanging atmosphere. This movement shifts the focus to the right side of the street, bringing a modern storefront with large glass windows and the name \"TOHGORO\" visible inside into the right half of the frame. The shop's interior is warmly lit, showcasing pottery on display shelves. A utility pole with a \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign featuring Japanese characters is prominent in the right foreground but eventually disappears from view. In front of the shop, a small tree stands on the sidewalk, and a red-and-white striped table is positioned in the middle ground, while a small wooden display table sits in the right middle ground at the shop's entrance. After the camera pans, the left side of the street and the buildings there are no longer visible in the frame. The shot uses a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and creates a sense of place and calm, emphasizing the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the environment rather than a specific subject.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a tranquil streetscape scenery shot in a traditional Japanese town. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of place and calm. The paved street is flanked by classic Japanese buildings with wooden facades and tiled roofs. In the distance, a lush, green hill rises against a clear blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a modern storefront for a shop named \"TOHGORO,\" which displays pottery and other goods through its large glass windows. A \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign is posted on the far right utility pole. Behind it, at the entrance to a shop, a wooden table displays some small tea sets. Further back, a red-and-white striped table in front of a glass window holds some small goods, and next to it stands a two-story tree, adding a touch of color to the quiet morning scene.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a quiet, paved street in a Japanese town during the daytime. The street is lined with traditional two-story buildings with wooden and beige exteriors and tiled roofs. In the background, a lush green hill rises against a clear blue sky. The camera pans to the right, focusing on a modern storefront with large glass windows and the name \"TOHGORO\" visible inside. The shop's interior is warmly lit, showcasing pottery on display shelves. Outside the shop, a small tree stands on the sidewalk, and a utility pole features a \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign with Japanese characters.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
