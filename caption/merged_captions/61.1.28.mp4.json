  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man with dark skin and long dreadlocks, wearing a large, light-colored hat and oversized white sunglasses, positioned in the center foreground. He has a gray beard and is dressed in a green jacket over a patterned shirt, with a silver chain necklace visible around his neck. The man faces the camera directly, set in an indoor environment with a lively, festive atmosphere. The background features a circular red-orange neon light in the top left, a red neon sign and hanging lights in the top right, and streamers slightly off-center, leaning towards the right at the top of the frame. Indistinct figures are present in the bottom left and bottom right background. The scene is dimly lit with warm, colorful lighting, featuring red and orange hues, and decorated with hanging streamers and neon signs, contributing to a celebratory feel. The man begins to sway his body from side to side, moving rhythmically, shifting from the center-left to the center-right throughout the clip. The camera, handheld at eye level, captures the man with a shallow depth of field, focusing on his face. It employs a level angle but includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. The camera moves physically forwards and backwards, matching the rhythm of the dance, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. The setting suggests a casual, social gathering, with people in the background contributing to the dynamic energy of the scene. The man's expression remains neutral as he maintains his position and expression throughout the sequence, enhancing the vibrant and eclectic vibe of the setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
