  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a large illuminated sign reading \"EL RANCHO,\" which occupies the center and upper portion of the frame in the foreground, with additional neon text below it also centered and in the foreground, stating \"Floor Show Susan Alexander Kane Twice Nightly.\" The sign is mounted on a metal framework, casting a glow against the dark background. Behind and below the sign, a geometric glass-topped structure is visible in the middle ground, positioned toward the lower center of the frame. The scene is set outdoors at night, in heavy rain with occasional lightning, and the environment is defined by the contrast between the bright sign and the shadowy surroundings. The camera, slightly unsteady, begins at a level angle, focused on the neon billboard in the foreground. It moves forward and slightly upward, passing through the billboard. As it clears the sign, the camera tilts down, shifting to a high-angle view while continuing its forward and downward motion. This gradual shift takes the illuminated sign out of the frame above, while the glass-topped structure becomes the new focus, now occupying the center-bottom and bottom-left of the frame in the foreground. By the end of the sequence, the sign is no longer visible, and the camera is positioned above the glass-topped structure, looking down at it from a higher vantage point. The background remains dark, with rain and occasional lightning, and no other major elements or subjects are present. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the foreground, and there are no visible people, with the video containing no overlays apart from the illuminated signage, which is part of the physical scene.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, overhead shot begins at a level angle, focused on a large neon billboard in the foreground. The camera moves upward and then forward, passing through the billboard. As it clears the sign, the camera tilts down, shifting to a high-angle view while continuing its forward and downward motion. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large illuminated sign displaying the words \"EL RANCHO\" in bold, bright letters, with additional neon text below reading \"Floor Show Susan Alexander Kane Twice Nightly.\" Below and behind the sign, there's a geometric, glass-topped structure. As the camera tilts down, continuing its forward and downward motion, the sign moves out of frame, focusing on the glass-topped structure by the end of the sequence.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves with a slight shake, initially upward and forward, before tilting down and continuing its forward and downward motion. This gradual shift takes the illuminated sign out of the frame and focuses on the geometric, glass-topped structure below, with no other subjects moving or exiting the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors at night, featuring the exterior of a venue with a large illuminated sign reading \"EL RANCHO\" in bold, bright letters, accompanied by smaller neon text below that states \"Floor Show,\" \"Susan Alexander Kane,\" and \"Twice Nightly.\" The sign is mounted on a metal framework, with the lights casting a glow against the dark background. Below and behind the sign, a glass-paneled canopy is visible, its geometric sections illuminated by the light from inside the canopy. The entire scene is set in heavy rain with occasional lightning, and the overall scene is dimly lit except for the prominent signage. There are no visible people, and the environment is defined by the contrast between the bright sign and the shadowy surroundings. The video contains no overlays apart from the illuminated signage, which is part of the physical scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
