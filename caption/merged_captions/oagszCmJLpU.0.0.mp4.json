  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot of a landscape is captured from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, where a massive storm system dominates most of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. The video is a time-lapse, capturing the dramatic movement of dark grey and black clouds as they churn and roll across the sky. A prominent, lower-hanging white shelf cloud stretches horizontally across the center of the scene as it churns and moves. Occupying the bottom of the frame, a flat, yellow-green field extends from the foreground to the distant horizon, where a small cluster of trees and buildings is visible in the background, situated on the bottom left. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the field in the foreground to the clouds in the background sharp. A white curtain of rain appears to fall from the base of the storm in the distance. The shot slowly and subtly pans left, following the movements of the white shelf clouds as the storm system moves leftward in the sky. The colossal and ominous storm system suggests an approaching severe weather event, with the immense scale of the cloud formation dwarfing the small cluster of distant trees and buildings.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low angle, looking up at the storm clouds. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the field in the foreground to the clouds in the background sharp. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from right to left, following the storm system as it moves leftward in the sky.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal and ominous storm system. Dark, turbulent grey and black clouds churn across the sky, with a prominent, low-hanging white shelf cloud stretching across the middle, suggesting an approaching severe weather event. Below this menacing sky, a vast, flat field of vibrant yellow-greenish plants or grass extends to the horizon, where a small cluster of distant trees and buildings is dwarfed by the immense scale of the cloud formation.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a massive storm system. The video appears to be a time-lapse, capturing the dramatic movement of the dark clouds as they churn and roll across the sky. The storm moves over a flat, green landscape.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat field of yellow-greenish plants or grass stretching toward a distant horizon where a small cluster of trees is visible. Dominating the sky is a massive, turbulent storm system. The clouds are a mix of dark grey and light grey as they churn and advance, with a lower, brighter white shelf cloud formation rolling across the landscape. A white curtain of rain appears to fall from the base of the storm in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
