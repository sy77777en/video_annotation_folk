  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot where an animated male character with a tall, slender build, dressed in a dark suit and gray pants, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center, in an acrobatic pose over the trunk of a light green, vintage-style sedan. The car is in the bottom center, angled away from the camera, while a prominent corner storefront with large display windows and a sign with the word \"pets\" in white and \"n shit\" in black, next to a cartoon logo of a dog and cat, occupies the left side of the frame. The setting is an urban street corner at either dawn or dusk, under a sky with soft orange and pink tones, defined by multi-story, rectangular buildings with a muted, grayish-purple color scheme, one of which features an external fire escape. As the character uses the roof of the green car for support and jumps over it, landing in a crouched position on a sidewalk in front of the pet store, the camera smoothly pans left, tracking him as he runs along the sidewalk toward the left. The scene transitions to an extreme wide shot, placing the character on the sidewalk in the middle ground, near the center of the frame, with a silver, modern sports coupe now visible in the bottom right. The character turns and stops the gray car approaching from the right, preventing a potential collision. As he moves further away, the camera stops panning and zooms in on him. Additional details include a white fire hydrant on the sidewalk and power lines stretching across the sky, with the silhouettes of taller city buildings visible in the distance.",

    "Camera": "This is an animated video. The camera smoothly pans left, tracking a man as he runs across a street and into the distance. As he moves further away, the camera stops panning and zooms in on him.",
    "Subject": "The video features a flat, animated male character with a tall, slender build, dressed in a dark suit and gray pants, with black hair.",
    "Motion": "An animated character uses the roof of a green car for support and jumps over it, landing in a crouched position on a sidewalk in front of a pet store. The character then turns and stops a gray car approaching from the right, preventing a potential collision.",
    "Scene": "This animated scene depicts an urban street corner at either dawn or dusk, under a sky with soft orange and pink tones. The setting is defined by multi-story, rectangular buildings with a muted, grayish-purple color scheme, one of which features an external fire escape. A prominent corner storefront has large display windows and a sign with the word \"pets\" in white and \"n shit\" in black, next to a cartoon logo of a dog and cat. On the paved street, a light green, vintage-style sedan is parked, while a silver, modern sports coupe is stopped near a crosswalk. Additional details include a white fire hydrant on the sidewalk and power lines stretching across the sky, with the silhouettes of taller city buildings visible in the distance. A figure in a black coat moves acrobatically over the green car and then runs along the sidewalk.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot where an animated character is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center, in an acrobatic pose over the trunk of a green car. The car is in the bottom center, angled away from the camera, while a storefront occupies the left side of the frame. As the character runs away from the camera, the scene transitions to an extreme wide shot, placing the character on the sidewalk in the middle ground, near the center of the frame, with a silver car now visible in the bottom right. The camera actively tracks the character's movement as he runs along the sidewalk toward the left, remaining in the middle ground and becoming smaller within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
