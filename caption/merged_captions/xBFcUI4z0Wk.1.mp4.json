  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of multiple race cars on a track during a high-intensity racing event, likely at night, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The damaged car with the number \"98,\" featuring a white and red livery, is parked at the boundary between the grass and the track, showing visible damage to its front bumper and emitting smoke, suggesting it may have been involved in a collision or is experiencing a mechanical issue. The yellow and black car, marked with the number \"2,\" is mostly positioned on the track, further into the middle ground behind it, also emitting smoke from its rear. In the middle ground, additional race cars, including a blue car and a red car, are seen moving along the track, navigating a corner and moving from the middle ground to the foreground, maintaining their speed despite the incident. The track encircles the grassy area and extends from the background to the foreground, with visible tire smoke and skid marks. The environment is clear, with no visible weather conditions affecting the scene. The camera features an overhead-level view at a high angle, looking down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly zooms out, providing a broader view of the entire scene, maintaining minimal shaking. The overall view is from an objective perspective, providing a comprehensive look at the racetrack and the ongoing race, with colorful cars displaying sponsor logos and numbers. The scene composition includes a wide asphalt track wrapping around a grassy area, bordered by a concrete barrier, with the track's yellow and black stripes visible in the background.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly zooms out, maintaining minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a dynamic scene involving multiple race cars on a track. The most prominent car, with a white body and red number \"98\" on the side, is positioned on the grass, showing visible damage to its front bumper and emitting smoke, suggesting it may have been involved in a collision or is experiencing a mechanical issue. Nearby, a yellow and black car, marked with the number \"2,\" is partially on the track and grass, also emitting smoke from its rear, indicating a possible collision or mechanical issue. Additional race cars are visible on the track, including a blue car and a red car, both moving at high speed. The scene suggests a high-intensity racing event with cars in various states of motion and distress.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a race track with multiple cars in motion. The most prominent car, marked with the number '98' and featuring a white and red livery, is stationary on the grass with visible damage to its front bumper, emitting smoke. Behind it, a yellow and black car with the number '2' is also stationary, with smoke coming from its rear, indicating a possible collision or mechanical issue. Several other race cars, including a blue car and a red car, are seen moving on the track, maintaining their speed despite the incident. The background includes the track's yellow and black stripes and the grassy area adjacent to the track.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during a race, likely at night, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide asphalt track wrapping around a grassy area, with a concrete barrier bordering the track. Several race cars are visible, with two cars prominently positioned at the intersection of the track and the grass, showing signs of damage. The remaining cars continue racing normally. The cars are colorful, with visible sponsor logos and numbers, and they are in motion, creating a dynamic atmosphere with tire smoke and skid marks on the track. The environment is clear, with no visible weather conditions affecting the scene. The overall view is from an objective perspective, providing a comprehensive look at the racetrack and the ongoing race.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
