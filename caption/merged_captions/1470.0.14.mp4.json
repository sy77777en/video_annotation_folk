  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person with medium-length, straight red hair, wearing a white dress shirt and a blue-and-white striped tie, positioned in the foreground and standing upright, facing forward. The camera is slightly below the subject's eye level, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the person, with a low angle looking up. The subject's face is marked with unusual, exaggerated features, including a prominent, wide smile and large eyes, giving an artificial or mask-like impression. The setting is indoors, with neutral-colored walls and a simple, modern design, illuminated by soft, natural light suggesting daytime. The background remains consistent, featuring a vent near the top right corner, contributing to a clean and uncluttered environment. Initially, the person appears to be trembling while speaking, then rolls their eyes before moving upward. As the subject moves upward, the frame changes from their head to their thighs, capturing their legs clad in dark pants, with their right hand visible, hanging relaxed by their side. The camera remains stationary, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the video, though it exhibits minor movement, zooming in with slight shakiness. In the latter part of the video, the person is shown wearing dark pants, maintaining their striking appearance due to the combination of formal clothing and unique facial characteristics.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
