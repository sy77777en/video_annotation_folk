  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a grand, semicircular courtyard at night, capturing the Place Édouard VII in Paris. The scene is dominated by a large, multi-story building with a curved facade, brilliantly illuminated by warm, yellow lights that highlight its classical details, numerous windows, and balconies. In the center of the cobblestone square stands a dark, bronze equestrian statue on a stone plinth. To the right, a prominent red neon sign for the \"THEATRE EDOUARD VII\" glows above an entrance flanked by red umbrellas and outdoor seating, while the ground-floor colonnade is lit with a cooler, greenish-white light, creating a striking visual contrast. The camera, positioned at a low angle, moves in a counterclockwise arc combined with a slight pullback, effectively expanding the view to reveal more of the architectural space and the people walking through the illuminated archways. This smooth, low-angle, eye-level time-lapse video captures the vibrant European courtyard at night, centered around the grand Théâtre Édouard VII. The scene is brought to life by a bustling crowd walking in the foreground and middle ground, adding a dynamic perspective to the view. The camera arcs counterclockwise around the central equestrian statue, with a deep focus keeping both the statue and the surrounding illuminated buildings in sharp detail. The upper levels of the building are bathed in warm, yellow light, while the ground level features a series of large arches. Pedestrians are visible in both the foreground and middle ground, navigating through the area surrounding the building, adding a lively and vibrant element to the otherwise serene nighttime atmosphere. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
