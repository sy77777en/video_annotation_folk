  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle shot focused on a tabletop, with a metallic pitcher and a ceramic bowl situated in the top of the frame in the middle ground, both casting distinct shadows. The backs of chairs are visible in the foreground along the left and right edges. The camera begins slightly out of focus, capturing the dining table with a light, natural finish, bathed in soft, warm daylight, suggesting a calm, sunny day. A hand enters from the bottom of the frame and moves upward, placing a tray of neatly arranged watermelon slices on white paper in the center of the frame, which becomes the subject of a full shot. The tray, displaying vibrant red flesh with black seeds and green rinds, settles in the middle ground, positioning the pitcher and bowl in the relative background. The camera moves smoothly downward, maintaining a consistent motion and bringing the tray of watermelon into sharp focus, emphasizing the vibrant colors and the neat arrangement. This action transforms the setting from simple to vibrant, enhancing the overall composition. The surrounding chairs, with their simple wooden design, frame the table, enhancing the cozy, inviting atmosphere. The focus shifts from the empty table setup to the colorful and inviting display of fruit, highlighting the transition to a more lively and detailed composition. The camera maintains its overhead perspective throughout, capturing the serene indoor setting and the dynamic change in the scene's composition.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
