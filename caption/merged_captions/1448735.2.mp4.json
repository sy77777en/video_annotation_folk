  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The moss-covered rocks and the forest floor are visible in the lower left foreground. Tall trees with thick trunks are distributed across the foreground, middle ground, and background, occupying a significant portion of the frame. The video begins with a view of these tall trees, lush green foliage, and moss-covered rocks scattered on the forest floor. As the camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining a consistent height above a narrow, winding path that extends from the bottom left corner to the center of the frame, the path becomes visible, winding through the forest. The path is surrounded by dense vegetation, including lush greenery and various undergrowth plants. To the left of the path, a small stream also extends from the bottom left corner to the center, situated in the middle ground, with water flowing gently over rocks and through the forest. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the stream and the surrounding forest, with the path curving slightly to the right. The camera angle remains level, looking straight ahead, and utilizes deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is steady and clear, with no shaking. The scene remains consistent with the dense forest and the stream, with the camera maintaining a steady forward motion. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's depth and natural beauty. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and the immersive experience of the forest, rather than a specific object or subject.",

    "Camera": "The video is filmed in a forest with the camera starting at eye level and moving forward smoothly, transitioning to an overhead-level view as the ground appears lower. The camera angle remains level, looking straight ahead, and utilizes deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is steady and clear, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the lush forest, trees, and greenery. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and the immersive experience of the forest, rather than a specific object or subject.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with thick trunks, lush green foliage, and moss-covered rocks scattered on the forest floor. As the camera moves forward, a narrow dirt path becomes visible, winding through the forest. The path is surrounded by dense vegetation, including lush greenery and various undergrowth plants. A small stream appears on the left side of the path, with water flowing gently over rocks and through the forest. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the stream and the surrounding forest, with the path curving slightly to the right. The scene remains consistent with the dense forest and the stream, with the camera maintaining a steady forward motion.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with thick trunks and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of brown earth and scattered moss-covered rocks, adding texture and color contrast. A narrow, winding path meanders through the trees, suggesting a natural trail. A small stream flows gently through the forest. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's depth and natural beauty.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The moss-covered rocks and the forest floor are visible in the lower left foreground. Tall trees with thick trunks are distributed across the foreground, middle ground, and background, occupying a significant portion of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, maintaining a consistent height above a narrow, winding path that extends from the bottom left corner to the center of the frame. This path, flanked by dense vegetation, leads deeper into the forest. To the left of the path, a small stream also extends from the bottom left corner to the center, situated in the middle ground. The camera's movement reveals more of the forest's intricate details, emphasizing its vastness and the spatial arrangement of its elements."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
