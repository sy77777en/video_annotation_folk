  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high angle, presents a cityscape scenery of a Venetian canal with no single main subject. A tilt-shift effect blurs the top and bottom of the frame. In the background, the canal narrows as it stretches into the distance between rows of historic, multi-story buildings in shades of yellow and tan. The middle ground is dominated by the wide, greenish waterway in the center, flanked by buildings on the left and right sides of the frame. On the right, numerous boats are docked along the canal bank, where several establishments feature red awnings over waterfront areas with gathered people. The time-lapse shows dynamic movement as various watercraft, including long, black gondolas navigated by gondoliers, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats, navigate the middle ground. A large white water bus briefly enters the bottom left foreground and moves toward the center before the clip ends. The camera executes a very smooth pan to the left across the canal, captured from a high angle, overhead level perspective, roughly at second-floor height. The shot appears to be in deep focus, though the edges of the frame are blurred, creating a tilt-shift effect. The scene is presented under a bright, overexposed sky, adding to the lively atmosphere of the bustling Grand Canal in Venice during a bright day.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. There is no single main subject, as the high-angle perspective and prominent tilt-shift effect create a miniature-like diorama, emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment rather than a specific element. The murky green water of the wide canal is filled with various watercraft, including long, black gondolas navigated by gondoliers, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats. Lining both sides of the waterway are historic, multi-story buildings in warm, earthy tones. On the right bank, numerous red awnings shade what appear to be waterfront cafes or restaurants, where people are gathered, adding to the lively scene under a bright, overexposed sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, tilt-shift video capturing a view of the Grand Canal in Venice. The shot looks down the waterway, flanked by historic buildings, with the focus on the bustling boat traffic. Various boats, including gondolas and water taxis, can be seen moving along the green-tinted water.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures the bustling activity along the Grand Canal in Venice during a bright day. The wide, greenish waterway is flanked on both sides by rows of historic, multi-story buildings in shades of yellow and tan. On the right bank, several establishments feature red awnings over waterfront areas where people are gathered. The canal is busy with various watercraft, including long, black gondolas being rowed, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats, all moving swiftly and creating wakes on the water's surface. The scene is presented with a tilt-shift effect, which blurs the edges of the frame, giving the city a miniature-like appearance under a bright, washed-out sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
