  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a leopard with a tan coat covered in black spots, positioned in the right middle ground on a dirt and grass slope. The large cat has a muscular build and a long tail that curls up, revealing a white underside. A dense thicket of green bushes and tall, straw-colored grass occupies the background and the left side of the frame. In a sunlit, natural landscape, the leopard walks cautiously from the right side of the frame to the left on a slight incline of dry, yellowed grass and reddish-brown earth. It maintains a low posture as it moves diagonally from the right towards the bottom left, with its long tail curled up at the end. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a ground-level shot with a slightly downward-tilted angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping both the grass in the foreground and the leopard in the middleground in focus. The slightly unsteady camera pans left and tilts up to follow the leopard as it moves, with these movements resulting from camera unsteadiness rather than intentional camera movement. As the leopard proceeds, it lowers its body and continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage and disappears from view, with its tail visible for a moment before it is fully concealed by the dense thicket of green bushes and taller grasses.",

    "Scene": "In a sunlit, natural landscape, a leopard moves down a gentle slope of reddish-brown earth mixed with dry, yellowed grass. A dense thicket of green bushes and taller, straw-colored grasses is situated in the middleground and background. As it proceeds, it lowers its body and disappears from the bottom left, with its tail visible for a moment before it is fully concealed by the foliage.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
