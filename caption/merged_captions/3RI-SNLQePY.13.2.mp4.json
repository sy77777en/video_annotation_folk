  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a static, side-view perspective of a pixelated, cavernous environment from a 2D game. The scene is composed of a maze-like structure of dark blue and black platforms and walls with a grid-like texture. A white icon is fixed in the bottom-left corner, and four pink heart icons are in the bottom-right corner. Starting from the lower center of the frame, a small, light grey, circular character with two white circular eyes, supported by a pixelated white bubble below, repeatedly leaps upward and to the left and right, eventually landing on a platform in the center-right area of the scene. Throughout the shot, glowing turquoise vines hang from the top of the frame, and a digital waterfall, represented by descending vertical blue lines, flows down the center. A small, white candle lamp inside a glowing circular dome hangs from the center top. The character's movements are deliberate as it explores the space, using the bubble-like object to jump left and right before jumping onto a higher platform on the right. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space. The static shot captures the scene without any camera movement, emphasizing the character's navigation through the dark, cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams.",

    "Subject": "The video features a pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The main subject is a small, light grey, circular character with a simple design, featuring two white circular eyes, navigating through the scene. This character moves vertically and horizontally, interacting with the environment. The setting includes platforms and walls that are dark blue or black with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a character moving through a dark, cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The character, which appears to be a small, light grey, circular figure with two white circular eyes, navigates through the scene by jumping and moving horizontally and vertically. The environment includes platforms and walls that are dark blue or black with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The character's movements are deliberate as it explores the space, using a bubble-like object to jump left and right before jumping onto a higher platform on the right.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, displays a dark, cavernous environment with a pixelated art style. The setting is composed of dark blue and black platforms and walls with a grid-like texture, forming a maze-like structure with vertical shafts. At the top of the scene, glowing cyan vines hang down. A digital waterfall, represented by descending vertical blue lines, flows down the center. A small, white candle lamp inside a glowing circular dome hangs from the center top, while a gray, circular character is seen jumping below. The scene features overlay elements, including a white and blue icon in the bottom-left corner and four pink, heart-shaped icons in the bottom-right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
