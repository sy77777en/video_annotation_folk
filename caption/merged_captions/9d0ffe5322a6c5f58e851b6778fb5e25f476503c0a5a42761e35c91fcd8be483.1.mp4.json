  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a cityscape at sunset, with the sky filling the upper two-thirds of the frame and the urban skyline situated along the bottom third. In the initial framing, a prominent white building is visible on the bottom left in the middle ground, while a silhouette of other buildings and dark trees stretches across the bottom of the frame. The camera, positioned from a high vantage point on a building and angled slightly upward, is slightly unsteady and handheld, slowly panning from left to right across the horizon, ending with a minor roll. As it moves, the white building shifts further to the left, and the central part of the cityscape moves towards the left side of the frame, revealing more of the expansive sky and the urban landscape on the right. The vast sky is filled with dramatic, scattered clouds painted in warm hues of orange, yellow, and soft grey, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, the silhouette of the city includes various buildings and lush treetops, including some identifiable palm trees, creating a tranquil urban landscape under the colorful evening sky. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the natural beauty of the sky and the man-made structures below, creating a mood of tranquil beauty. The entire scene is captured from a low-angle perspective, providing a view that looks up at the sky while overlooking the city. The camera's slow pan offers a wider view of the colorful, cloud-filled sky and the urban landscape, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.",

The sky is filled with a vast expanse of clouds, painted in warm hues of gold, orange, and soft yellow by the setting sun, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, a silhouette of city buildings and lush, dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dynamic view of a peaceful city skyline at sunset, with the camera panning to the right and slightly rotating. The vast sky is filled with dramatic, scattered clouds painted in warm hues of orange, yellow, and soft grey. Below, the silhouette of the city includes various buildings and lush treetops, creating a tranquil urban landscape under the colorful evening sky.",
    "Scene": "Positioned on a high building at a low angle looking upward, the scene captures a dramatic sunset. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of scattered clouds, tinged with shades of golden yellow, orange, and grey from the setting sun. Below, a silhouette of the city skyline stretches across the horizon, featuring a mix of buildings and dark green trees, including some identifiable palm trees. A prominent white, multi-story building is visible on the left, while other structures are seen in the middle distance. The camera performs a slow pan to the right, offering a wider view of the colorful, cloud-filled sky and the urban landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
