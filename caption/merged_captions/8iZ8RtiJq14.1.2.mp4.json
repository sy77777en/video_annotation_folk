  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, where a miniature McDonald's restaurant model is positioned in the center middle ground. To its left in the middle ground stands a tall McDonald's \"M\" signpost. Oversized replicas of french fries and a drink cup are located slightly behind the restaurant, in the center-right and center-left middle ground, respectively. A sign with a large \"50\" displayed prominently at the top is visible to the right in the middle ground. The board game surface itself occupies the foreground and middle ground, with small figurines scattered across it. Green hills form the background at the top of the frame. As the camera, positioned at an aerial level, smoothly moves backward and upward, the scene transitions to a full shot. In this wider view, the entire board-game-like town becomes the central focal point, now more distinctly in the foreground and middle ground, surrounded by the expansive green hills and a pale, purplish sky in the background. A white picket fence appears in the far-right background. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout this transition, revealing more of the diorama, including additional small figurines and the surrounding landscape of green hills and trees. The video displays a miniature diorama representing a McDonald's-themed town, designed to resemble a board game. Central to this diorama is a model of a McDonald's restaurant featuring a brown, sloped roof and the \"McDonald's\" name visible on its facade. Adjacent to the restaurant stands a tall, red rectangular signpost topped with the iconic golden yellow \"M\" logo. The perimeter is lined with patterned rectangular squares, and small, indistinct figures are positioned on the game board. The video resolution is too low to determine the camera's focus.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view of a miniature McDonald's playset. The camera smoothly moves backward and upward, revealing more of the scene. The video resolution is too low to determine the camera's focus.",
    "Subject": "The camera is positioned high above the scene at the beginning. The video displays a miniature diorama representing a McDonald's-themed town, designed to resemble a board game. Central to this diorama is a model of a McDonald's restaurant featuring a brown, sloped roof and the \"McDonald's\" name visible on its facade. Adjacent to the restaurant stands a tall, red rectangular signpost topped with the iconic golden yellow \"M\" logo. Prominently featured within the diorama are oversized replicas of McDonald's food items: a large red carton filled with yellow french fries, marked with a yellow \"M,\" and a large drink cup, primarily white with red and yellow accents. Another smaller, upright sign, appearing red and white with the number \"50\" and text, is also visible. As the camera moves backward and upward, more of the landscape comes into view. Several small, indistinct human-like figurines are scattered throughout the scene, some posed as if walking. The entire setup is laid out on a flat surface divided into squares and paths, characteristic of a board game, with additional small, dark green block-like structures and a small, dark, car-like object populating the miniature landscape. Surrounding the board game-like setup are green trees and rolling hills.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up view of a McDonald's-themed town diorama, featuring a McDonald's restaurant, a large drink cup, a carton of fries, and a signpost with the number '50'. As the camera physically moves backward, more of the diorama becomes visible, including additional small figurines and the surrounding landscape of green hills and trees. The camera continues to move back, revealing the full extent of the diorama, which is laid out on a flat surface with a chessboard-like grid and various small structures and vehicles.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows a miniature, stylized outdoor scene depicting a McDonald's-themed board game. The game board, featuring light-colored squares and pathways, is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills under a pale, purplish sky, suggesting daytime or dusk. Prominent visual elements include a miniature McDonald's restaurant with a brown roof and yellow arches, a tall red sign with the yellow McDonald's \"M\" logo, and oversized representations of a McDonald's drink cup and a red box of french fries. Another sign, predominantly red and yellow with black lettering, displays the text \"50 MILLION PRIZES.\" Scattered army green houses are present on the game board, and the perimeter is lined with patterned rectangular squares. Small, indistinct figures are positioned on the game board. A white picket fence is visible in the distance along the edge of the green hills.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
