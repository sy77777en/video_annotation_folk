  "merged_caption": "This video is presented from a fixed, first-person perspective, split into three horizontal sections. The top section shows a top-down, pixelated view of a border crossing in the background, with a queue of black figures on the left and several blue guards on the right. The main, lower section depicts the inspector's booth, featuring a wooden desk and counter. A man with green-tinged skin, a bald head with green hair on the sides, and a red shirt is visible on the left side of the frame, behind the counter. On the right side, an \"M.O.A. CITATION\" with purple text indicating a protocol violation is fixed, while a \"WANTED\" poster showing three headshots is positioned nearby. In the center, a large, golden key and a small, framed drawing of a red stick figure labeled \"Arstotzka Hero\" hang on the back wall. Throughout the clip, a mouse cursor moves various documents onto the desk: a yellow \"Certificate of Vaccination\" for \"JORJI COSTAVA\" and a red passport with a gold emblem are moved from the bottom left to the center. The red passport opens to reveal a white \"ENTRY VISA\" featuring a photo of a bald, bearded man. Speech bubbles with text such as \"Papers, please.\" and \"Hello Jorji.\" appear and disappear near the man on the left. The camera remains completely static throughout the video. The top portion of the screen also includes overlays, such as a \"Papers, Please.\" title in the top left. The scene is a screen recording of a software interface depicting a pixel-art border checkpoint from inside a guard's booth, with a bleak, gray checkpoint visible in the top section.",

    "Scene": "A screen recording of a software interface depicts a pixel-art border checkpoint from inside a guard's booth. The top portion of the screen shows an overhead view of a bleak, gray checkpoint with a long queue of silhouetted figures on the left and several guards on the right. The main, lower portion is the inspector's workspace, featuring a wooden desk and counter where a green-skinned character in a red shirt is visible through the window. On the desk, a mouse cursor moves various documents, including a red passport, a yellow Certificate of Vaccination, and an Entry Visa. Overlays are present on the screen, including speech bubbles from the character, a \"Papers, Please.\" title in the top left, and a \"WANTED\" poster on the right. A prominent white overlay window for an \"M.O.A. CITATION\" details a protocol violation and a warning.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
