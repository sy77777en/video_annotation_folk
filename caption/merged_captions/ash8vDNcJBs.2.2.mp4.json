  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person in tactical gear positioned in the center of the frame, with another individual following closely behind going towards the right. Both are wearing black helmets and full-face gas masks with large, orange-tinted visors, brownish-green jackets under tactical vests, and black gloves, with solid blue square patches on their right shoulders. A large rock formation occupies the foreground on the left, contrasting with the smooth, flat surface of the concrete wall on the right. The environment is cast in a dim, cool-toned light. The camera, from a shaky, eye-level perspective, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the soldier in the foreground. It moves forward slightly and pans left to follow the soldier as they take cover behind a wall. The first person moves swiftly from left to right, stops midway, and then retreats behind a concrete wall without peeking out, causing the framing to tighten into a medium close-up. They end their movement on the left side of the frame, partially concealed by the foreground rock, while a concrete wall remains in the background. Meanwhile, another person in similar gear moves quickly through the foreground from left to right. A figure wearing a helmet, gas mask, and tactical vest is seen moving behind the broken wall to take cover. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamics of the scene as the individuals navigate the stark, enclosed space defined by large, grey concrete block walls.",

    "Subject": "Two individuals in tactical gear move cautiously while holding black rifles. They are wearing black helmets and full-face gas masks with large, orange-tinted visors. Their uniforms include brownish-green jackets under tactical vests of a similar color, with solid blue square patches on the right shoulders. They are also wearing black gloves.",
    "Motion": "A person in tactical gear moves swiftly from left to right, stops midway, and then retreats behind a concrete wall without peeking out. Meanwhile, another person in similar gear moves quickly through the foreground from left to right.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a stark, enclosed space defined by large, grey concrete block walls. The environment is cast in a dim, cool-toned light. To the left, a large, rough-textured rock or debris formation contrasts with the smooth, flat surface of the concrete wall on the right. A figure wearing a helmet, gas mask, and tactical vest is seen moving behind the broken wall to take cover.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
