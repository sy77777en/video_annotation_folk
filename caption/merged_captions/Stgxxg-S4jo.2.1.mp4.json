  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a group of six people stands initially in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a vast, snowy landscape. The group consists of four men and two women, arranged in two rows with the men in the back and the women in front. On the far left, a man with a beard wears a red hooded jacket and black pants. In front of and to his left, a woman in a dark jacket, black pants, and a gray beanie stands. In the center, a man with a beard and dark hair wears a dark jacket. Slightly in front of and to his left, a woman in a red jacket and dark pants stands. Behind and to her left, a man in a yellow top is positioned. On the far right, a man in a dark jacket and pants completes the group. They pose with their arms raised and outstretched. Behind them, also in the middle ground, are several large, snow-covered trees, with a smaller, similar tree located to their right. The foreground is an expanse of untouched snow. In the distant background, faint outlines of mountains are visible through the mist. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the group and trees, capturing them in the middle ground of a snowy landscape with deep focus. As the camera moves, the group shifts to the center of the frame, revealing more of the expansive, snowy environment around them. The snow-covered trees and hills in the background become more prominent. As the video progresses, some members lower their arms, and the woman in black performs a casual wiggle dance. The group slightly moves their upper bodies to follow the camera's movement. The background features a misty, pale sky, contributing to a cold, wintry atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "A group of six people, four men and two women, stand together in a snowy landscape, raising and outstretching their arms to pose. The group is arranged in two rows, with the four men in the back and the two women in front. On the far left, a man with a beard wears a red hooded jacket and black pants.

On the far right, a man in a dark jacket and pants completes the group. Behind them, several trees with branches heavily covered in white snow droop downwards, with two large trees being most prominent. A smaller, similarly snow-covered tree stands to the left of the main group of trees.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a snowy landscape during daytime, with a group of people initially positioned closer to the right side of the frame, gradually moving to the center as the camera arcs. They stand on a thick blanket of snow, surrounded by several tall trees with branches heavily coated in white snow, forming intricate, frosted shapes. The background features a misty, pale sky and faint outlines of distant mountains, contributing to a cold, wintry atmosphere. The ground is uniformly covered in snow, with no visible paths or structures, and the overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted grays. The group's winter clothing adds small accents of color against the otherwise monochromatic setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
