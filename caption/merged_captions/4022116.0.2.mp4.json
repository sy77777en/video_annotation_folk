  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot capturing the iconic Grand Canal in Venice on an overcast day. The video begins with a wide shot of a Venetian canal, with the choppy, greenish water occupying the lower portion of the frame and foreground and extending into the background. Historic, multi-story buildings with reddish-brown brick and plaster facades and terracotta roofs line the left and right sides of the frame from the middle ground to the background. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, handheld position above the water on a moving boat, maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. As the boat moves backward, the camera also moves backward, pans left, and tilts slightly up, shifting the view from the center of the canal to the buildings and a docked water bus on the left bank. As the camera moves, a docked white and light yellow vaporetto labeled \"Actv 26\" in the middle ground enters the frame from the left and moves out of frame from the right, carrying passengers. Various boats populate the scene, including a smaller wooden motorboat navigating the waterway. The pan concludes by revealing a large, ornate white church, the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute, with wide stone steps leading down to a dock where other water buses are moored. This grand church occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground. People can be seen on the boats and along the waterfront docks. There is no single main subject, as the shot is designed to immerse the viewer in the unique atmosphere and architectural scale of the Venetian environment, emphasizing the city's reliance on its canals.",

    "Motion": "This video features a brief panning shot across a canal. The scene is set in Venice, Italy, on what appears to be an overcast day. The choppy, green water of the canal is flanked by historic Venetian buildings with terracotta roofs, and several boats, including a water taxi and a larger public vaporetto, are visible.

    "Scene": "The video captures a scene on the Grand Canal in Venice under an overcast sky. The choppy, greenish water is flanked by historic, multi-story buildings with reddish-brown brick and plaster facades and tiled roofs. On one side, a large, ornate white church with wide steps descends toward the water. Various boats navigate the canal, including a prominent white and off-white vaporetto, or water bus, with \"Actv 26\" on its side, carrying passengers. Another smaller, classic water taxi is visible further down the canal. People can be seen on the boats and along the waterfront docks.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a scenery shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
