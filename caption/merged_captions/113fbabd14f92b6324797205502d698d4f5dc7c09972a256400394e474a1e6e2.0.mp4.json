  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot that begins with a wide expanse of brown sand occupying the bottom foreground of the frame. The calm ocean is positioned in the middle ground, with the horizon line bisecting the center of the frame, while the sky, filled with large, low-hanging white and grey clouds, takes up the top half of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at nearly eye level and at a low height, moves forward smoothly and swiftly from the beach, gliding over the gentle, lapping waves at the shoreline. As it progresses, the sand disappears from the bottom of the frame, and the ocean water comes to fill the entire lower half, becoming the new foreground and middle ground. The water stretches to the horizon under a dramatic sky, with patches of blue visible between the cloud formations. The shot concludes with the camera moving steadily over the water's surface, while the sky and horizon remain in their initial positions. The drone's path continues over the rippling surface of the water until only the sea and sky are visible. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire landscape sharp from the beach to the distant clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is deliberately placed on the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment. The shot's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vastness of the sea and sky rather than to highlight a specific object or entity.",

    "Subject": "This is a coastal scenery shot that begins on a wide, flat expanse of brown sand before gliding forward over the gentle, lapping waves and out across the vast, calm surface of the grey-blue ocean. The sky above is filled with large, low-hanging white and grey clouds, with patches of blue visible between them.

    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot that moves forward from a wide, sandy beach out over the calm ocean. The water stretches to the horizon under a dramatic sky filled with large, white and grey clouds. Patches of blue sky are visible between the cloud formations.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone moves forward from a wide, sandy beach out over the calm, grey-green ocean. The sky above is a mix of blue patches and large, dense white and grey clouds that hang low over the horizon. The drone glides over the wet sand and gentle, lapping waves at the shoreline, continuing its path over the rippling surface of the water until only the sea and sky are visible.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot. Initially, a wide expanse of brown sand occupies the bottom foreground of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
