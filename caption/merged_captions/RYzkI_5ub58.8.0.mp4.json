  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot of a female mallard duck positioned in the center of the frame, resting in the middle ground amidst tall, vibrant green grass. The duck, with mottled brown and tan feathers and a dark gray bill with distinct orange coloring along the sides, lies still throughout the video, with only slight movements of its head. The scene is set outdoors in a field illuminated by warm, golden sunlight. In the left background, a tall blade of grass is positioned closer to the duck compared to the other grass, while in the left foreground, a blade of grass is too close to the camera, resulting in a yellow blur. Some blades of grass are visible in the foreground, and the background is composed of more out-of-focus grass, creating a shallow depth of field. The camera is positioned at the duck's level, capturing the scene from a ground-level, level angle. This slightly unsteady, static shot employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the duck in the midground and creating a heavily blurred background. The duck's body faces forward, with its head turned to the right side of the frame, looking toward the side. The framing remains static throughout the shot, emphasizing the serene and tranquil setting.",

    "Subject": "A female mallard duck is sitting in green grass. The duck has mottled brown and tan feathers covering its body and head. Its bill is primarily dark gray with distinct orange coloring along the sides. The duck is resting with its body facing forward and its head turned to the right side of the frame, looking toward the side.",
    "Motion": "The female mallard duck lies still in the green grass throughout the video, with only slight movements of its head.",
    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is set in a field of tall, vibrant green grass, illuminated by warm, golden sunlight. A brown-and-black patterned duck with a dark bill is nestled in the grass in the center of the composition. The level-angle shot captures the scene from ground level, with the sunlit blades of grass in the foreground and a soft-focus green background creating a shallow depth of field.",
    "Spatial": "This is a full shot of a female mallard duck positioned in the center of the frame. The duck rests in the middle ground, surrounded by tall green grass. In the left background, a tall blade of grass is positioned closer to the duck compared to the other grass. In the left foreground, a blade of grass is too close to the camera, resulting in a yellow blur. Some blades of grass are visible in the foreground, while the background is composed of more out-of-focus grass, creating a shallow depth of field.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
