  "merged_caption": "This video is a time-lapse scenery shot of a city square on a partly cloudy day. The scene begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a large, stone-paved plaza in the foreground, extending to the middle ground across the bottom of the frame. An ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire and intricate carvings is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, while a modern glass skyscraper under construction, complete with a crane at its top, is visible in the background to the left of center. The camera initially moves forward while zooming out, creating a dolly zoom effect. As it continues to move forward toward the central monument, it begins to arc counterclockwise around the structure while tilting up, shifting the perspective from a level to a low angle. This movement reframes the scene into a wide shot, with the monument now centered and occupying the majority of the frame from bottom to top. In the final view, the camera is positioned at the monument, looking steeply upward at its center against the sky in the upper two-thirds of the frame. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Fast-moving white clouds are seen moving rapidly as the sun shines brightly, emphasizing the dynamic sky. The juxtaposition and scale difference between the historic monument and the towering new development capture the atmosphere of a rapidly evolving urban landscape, with lush green trees and other smaller buildings completing the background.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video, as shown by the rapidly moving clouds. Initially, the camera moves forward while zooming out, creating a dolly zoom effect. Subsequently, the camera continues to move forward toward the central monument. As it approaches, it begins to arc counterclockwise around the structure while tilting up, shifting the perspective from a level to a low angle. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a striking contrast between traditional and modern architecture under a dramatic, partly cloudy sky. The scene is set in a large, paved plaza featuring an ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire and intricate carvings. Towering in the background is a modern glass skyscraper, still under construction with a crane visible at its peak. The camera moves forward while zooming out, creating a dolly zoom effect, and then arcs counter-clockwise, which highlights the monument. This movement emphasizes the juxtaposition and scale difference between the historic monument and the towering new development, capturing the atmosphere of a rapidly evolving urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse scenery shot of a public square featuring an ornate white monument. The camera consistently moves forward, later incorporating a tilt upward and an arc counterclockwise towards the monument as the clouds are seen moving rapidly. The scene contrasts the traditional architecture of the monument with a modern skyscraper under construction in the background.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video shows a city square on a partly cloudy day. In a large, stone-paved plaza stands an ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire. The background features a modern glass skyscraper under construction, complete with a crane at its top, alongside other smaller buildings and lush green trees. Fast-moving white clouds move as the sun shines brightly. The camera transitions from an extremely wide view, pushing in and tilting up while arcing counter-clockwise to focus on the monument against the dynamic sky.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a scenery shot. The scene begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a paved plaza in the foreground, extending to the middle ground across the bottom of the frame. An ornate monument is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, while a modern skyscraper under construction is visible in the background to the left of center. The camera then pushes in towards the monument, and during the latter part of its movement, it combines with a simultaneous counter-clockwise arc and upward tilt to create a low-angle shot. This movement reframes the scene into a wide shot, with the monument now centered and occupying the majority of the frame from bottom to top. In the final view, the camera is positioned at the monument, looking steeply upward at its center against the sky in the upper two-thirds of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
