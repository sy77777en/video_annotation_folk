  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, showing a white, elongated, boat-like object with a smooth, curved hull and a flat stern featuring several small, rectangular indentations in the upper-center middle ground against a dark, textured background. In the foreground, a long, white, pointed mast or drill pipe extends from the bottom center of the frame, aimed at the underside of the vessel. The camera then shifts to an upside-down, level angle, maintaining a dynamic focus throughout the shot. Initially, the boat is in focus in the middle ground. The pointed white mast, positioned above the stationary white vessel, appears to be on the verge of cracking from the start. It shatters at its tip in the bottom center of the frame, creating a spray of small, white and dark particles and a cloud of debris. The focus then shifts to the tube in the foreground as it breaks. The mast breaks into three separate white, cylindrical sections, including a smaller piece with a T-shaped end, which tumble downward into the dark expanse, surrounded by a cloud of small, white debris. The boat-like object moves to the top edge of the frame, while the now-separated pieces of the mast become the central subject. The upper section of the broken mast is in the upper center, the middle section is in the center, and other fragments, including the T-shaped piece, are floating through the middle and bottom-right of the frame, respectively. By the end, the shot transitions to a deep focus, bringing the entire scene into clarity, with the fragmented pieces appearing to float away from each other against the dark background.",

    "Subject": "A white, elongated, boat-like object with a smooth, curved hull and a flat stern featuring several small, rectangular indentations is shown against a dark, textured background. In the foreground, a long, white, pointed mast or drill pipe is initially aimed at the underside of the vessel. This mast then shatters near its tip, creating a spray of small, white and dark particles. The mast is then shown broken into three separate white, cylindrical sections that are falling apart. One of the smaller, broken-off pieces has a T-shaped end.",
    "Motion": "A pointed white mast, positioned above a stationary white vessel, shatters at its tip, sending a spray of small particles outward. The mast then breaks apart, and its cylindrical sections appear to float away from each other against a dark background.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, deep environment, a white, oblong vessel is viewed from above. A long, white, pointed pipe, integral to the vessel, extends upwards towards the camera. The pipe appears to be on the verge of cracking from the start, and eventually breaks into separate sections. The fragmented pieces tumble downward into the dark expanse, surrounded by a cloud of small, white debris.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
