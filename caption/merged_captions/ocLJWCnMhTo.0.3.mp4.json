  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man with dark skin standing in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt with a multicolored design and light-colored baggy pants. He holds his hands up with palms facing forward, and an arc of fire extends from them toward a small, round table in the foreground at the bottom center. The hands of a second person, seated at the table, are visible in the bottom left foreground. The scene is set indoors with a black and white checkered tile floor and light-colored, textured walls. The table, with a metallic top, is surrounded by several chairs, some made of a translucent material with metal frames. As the camera, initially at the standing man's level, cranes upward in an arc, transitioning from a level perspective to a bird's-eye view, the initial arc of fire dissipates while a new ring of fire ignites around the perimeter of the table. During this movement, the standing man's head moves out of the top of the frame, while more of the seated person's body is revealed in the bottom left. The table moves from the bottom center of the frame to the center, now viewed from directly above, as the checkered floor becomes the primary background. The entire scene is framed by a dark, soft-edged vignette overlay, giving the video a grainy, vintage quality. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement, capturing the dynamic transition from the initial arc of fire to the encircling ring of fire around the table.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins at a hip-level, level angle on a man standing by a table. The camera then cranes up in an arc, raising the viewpoint to eye level and shifting the perspective to a bird's-eye view looking down at the table. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "A man with dark skin stands wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt featuring a multicolored design with yellow, red, blue, and green on the chest, along with light-colored baggy pants. He holds his hands up with his palms facing forward, and as the video progresses, his head moves out of the frame. Opposite him, another person is seated at a small, round table. Initially, only this person's hands are visible, positioned above the table. At the start of the video, an arc of fire is already present in front of the man's palms. As the camera cranes upward in an arc, the fire in front of his hands gradually diminishes, while the table becomes surrounded by a ring of fiery arcs.",
    "Motion": "A man stands with his hands raised as an arc of fire extends from them toward a small table. The camera cranes upward in an arc, transitioning from a level perspective to a bird's-eye view. As the camera moves, the initial arc of fire dissipates while a new ring of fire ignites around the perimeter of the table, where another person is seated.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a room featuring a black and white checkered tile floor and light-colored, textured walls. A small, round table with a metallic top sits in the middle of the space, accompanied by several chairs, some of which are made of a translucent material with metal frames. In the middle ground, a person stands wearing a white shirt and light-colored pants. A bright orange stream of fire arcs through the air, directed toward the tabletop. As this occurs, the camera cranes upward, transitioning from a level angle to a bird's-eye view over the table. The entire scene is framed by a dark, soft-edged vignette overlay, which gives the video a grainy, vintage quality.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, with a round table in the foreground at the bottom center. The hands of a second person are visible in the bottom left foreground, resting near the table. An arc of fire originates from the center-right of the frame, specifically from the man's hand, and curves down toward the foreground table. As the camera, initially at the standing man's level, cranes upward, the shot transitions into a bird's-eye angle view. During this movement, the standing man's head moves out of the top of the frame, while more of the seated person's body is revealed in the bottom left. The table has moved from the bottom center of the frame to the center of the frame, now viewed from directly above, as the checkered floor becomes the primary background, and a ring of fire encircles the table in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
