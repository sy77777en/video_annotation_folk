  "merged_caption": "The video captures a serene residential neighborhood with a wide shot from street level, offering a view of the street that runs from the bottom center to the top center of the frame. Houses line both sides of the street, with a silver van parked on the left in the foreground. The houses are positioned in the middle ground, surrounded by vibrant greenery and neatly trimmed gardens. The sky forms the background, with clouds casting soft shadows. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing a street view. It moves forward steadily along the road, occasionally panning left to show buildings. The focus is deep, maintaining clarity across the scene. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing a serene residential neighborhood on a sunny day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a quiet street lined with well-maintained houses. The houses are primarily two-story structures with light-colored facades, surrounded by lush greenery and neatly trimmed hedges. A silver van is parked on the left side of the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky is partly cloudy, allowing sunlight to cast soft shadows on the ground. The street is paved, with a mix of concrete and cobblestone paths leading to the house entrances. Vibrant green plants and blooming flowers, including hydrangeas, enhance the tranquil atmosphere. The overall environment is peaceful, with a sense of suburban calmness. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the overall setting, allowing viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
