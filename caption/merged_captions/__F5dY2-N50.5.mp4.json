  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a tropical garden scene. Initially, the frame is composed with a paved patio in the bottom foreground, where a round, glass-topped table is positioned in the bottom right, holding a small, white, square box. A path of dark stepping stones on white sand begins at the bottom center and extends into the middle ground, passing a large, gnarled tree trunk located in the center-right. A low, off-white wall runs along the left side of the frame, while dense green foliage occupies the middle ground and fills the background. The camera begins at a level angle, tilts down into a high-angle view, and then tilts back up, with subtle panning to adjust the frame, offering different perspectives of the garden. Despite the unsteadiness, a deep focus ensures the entire scene, from the foreground table to the background foliage, remains sharp and clear. The path is bordered by lush green vegetation, contributing to the secluded and peaceful atmosphere. A dark, round pot sits next to the farthest stone of the path. The final perspective offers a view of the garden path and the surrounding greenery from a camera height that is approximately eye-level relative to the patio. The video captures the interplay of natural elements like sand and plants with modern design, conveying a feeling of a peaceful escape, emphasizing tranquility and immersion in nature.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot captures a sandy courtyard with a  unsteady camera movement. The camera begins at a level angle, tilts down into a high-angle view, and then tilts back up, with subtle panning to adjust the frame. Despite the unsteadiness, a deep focus ensures the entire scene, from the foreground table to the background foliage, remains sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a serene garden scene at a tropical resort, viewed from a paved patio area. A pathway of dark grey, rectangular stepping stones is set into fine white sand, extending away from the viewer and passing by the side of a large, gnarled tree with a dark brown trunk. The scene is framed by low, off-white walls and an abundance of lush, green tropical foliage, creating a sense of secluded privacy. The video focuses on the overall environment—the interplay of natural elements like sand and plants with modern design—to convey a feeling of a peaceful escape, emphasizing tranquility and immersion in nature.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a serene view of a garden path in a tropical location. The footage, taken from a paved patio, shows a walkway made of rectangular grey stone slabs set in fine white sand. The path is bordered by lush green vegetation, with a large, gnarled tree situated on one side, contributing to the secluded and peaceful atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "From an open patio, a view opens onto a secluded garden path during the daytime. A series of rectangular, dark gray stone slabs are set into white sand, creating a walkway that leads away from the viewer. The path is bordered on the left by a low, off-white wall and is surrounded by dense, green tropical foliage, including various plants and a large tree with a prominent, gnarled trunk. A dark, round pot sits next to the farthest stone of the path. In the foreground to the right, a round, dark-colored table with a glass top holds a small, white, square box. The camera pans and tilts, adjusting the frame to offer different perspectives of the garden.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide shot of a tropical garden scene. Initially, the frame is composed with a paved patio in the bottom foreground, where a round, glass-topped table is positioned in the bottom right. A path of dark stepping stones on white sand begins at the bottom center and extends into the middle ground, passing a large tree trunk located in the center-right. A low, off-white wall runs along the left side of the frame, while dense green foliage occupies the middle ground and fills the background. The camera then performs a pan to the left combined with a slight downward tilt, before tilting back up to the initial perspective. The final perspective offers a view of the garden path and the surrounding greenery from a camera height that is approximately eye-level relative to the patio."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
