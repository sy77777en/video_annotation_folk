  "merged_caption": "The video is captured in a static, full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a deep focus to ensure clarity of both the man sitting and the man standing in the foreground. A Black man stands in the center-left of the frame, wearing a brown t-shirt and dark jeans, holding a red soda can in his left hand and a green beer bottle in his right. To his right, a bald white man sits in a brown leather armchair in the bottom-right, wearing a light blue button-down shirt and grey trousers, with only his upper body visible. The standing man extends his right arm, offering the green beer bottle to the seated man, who reaches his right hand from the bottom-right to accept it. The standing man then retracts his arm. The scene is set inside a rustic room during the daytime, with walls constructed from wood paneling and corrugated metal. Large, multi-paned windows line the walls, revealing a sunny, green landscape with trees outside. The room is furnished with a black leather armchair holding a patterned pillow in the bottom-left corner and a small wooden table between the two men, holding a green vase and a book. In the background, a workbench is cluttered with tools and bottles, and a green tool board with neatly arranged instruments hangs on the right wall. The space is illuminated solely by natural light, as the green-shaded pendant lamps hanging from the ceiling are not turned on. The standing man initially looks towards the seated man before offering him the beer bottle, and the seated man looks up at the standing man as he reaches out to accept it.",

    "Subject": "The video features two men inside a room with large windows. A Black man stands wearing a brown t-shirt and dark jeans, holding a red soda can in his left hand and a green beer bottle in his right. He initially looks towards the other man before offering him the beer bottle. A bald white man sits in a brown leather armchair, wearing a light blue button-down shirt and grey trousers. He looks up at the standing man and reaches out to accept the offered beer bottle.",
    "Motion": "A man standing on the left extends his right arm, offering a green beer bottle to a man sitting in a brown leather chair. The seated man reaches forward with his right hand to accept the bottle. The standing man then retracts his arm.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a rustic room during the daytime, with walls constructed from wood paneling and corrugated metal. Large, multi-paned windows line the walls, revealing a sunny, green landscape with trees outside. The room is furnished with a black leather armchair holding a patterned pillow and a brown leather armchair where a man is seated. Between them, a small wooden table holds a green vase and a book. In the background, a workbench is cluttered with tools and bottles, and a green tool board with neatly arranged instruments hangs on the wall. The space is illuminated solely by natural light, as the green-shaded pendant lamps hanging from the ceiling are not turned on. A second man is positioned in the center-left of the room.",
    "Spatial": "The video is captured in a static, full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A standing man occupies the center-left of the frame in the foreground. To his right, a seated man is positioned in the bottom-right, also in the foreground, with only his upper body visible. In the middle ground, a black armchair sits in the bottom-left corner. The background consists of large windows across the top and left, with a workbench and tool board on the right. The standing man extends his right arm, moving a bottle from his side toward the center of the frame to offer it to the seated man, who then reaches his right hand from the bottom-right to accept it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
