  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a short beard, capturing him from the chest up. He is wearing a light-colored cap and a dark, loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt. Positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame, the man occupies the middle of the image. His raised right arm extends towards the top of the frame, seemingly holding onto something to prevent himself from falling, while his head is slightly tilted to the right. The background consists of a mountainous landscape, characterized by rugged terrain and distant peaks under a cloudy sky, situated in the background and extending into the distance, creating depth. The environment suggests a cool, overcast day, with muted natural colors dominating the scene. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective, and employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits slight unsteadiness without intentional movement. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subject within the frame. The man's expression appears focused and engaged, and he seems to be in the middle of speaking, with his interaction directed towards something outside the frame, emphasizing his engagement with the unseen environment. The overall atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the natural backdrop providing a dramatic contrast to the human presence. The camera angle and framing keep the focus firmly on the man against the expansive backdrop, highlighting his posture and expression that suggest engagement with the surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The video features a man suspended in the air, captured at a level angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits slight unsteadiness without intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a short beard. He is wearing a light-colored cap and a dark, loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt. The man is raising his right arm while tilting his head slightly to the left, and his expression appears focused and engaged. He is looking in a direction that suggests he is interacting with something or someone off-screen.",
    "Motion": "The man, positioned in a mountainous area with a cloudy sky in the background, raises his right arm out of the frame, seemingly holding onto something to prevent himself from falling. He tilts and turns his head slightly to the left and appears to be in the middle of speaking.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a mountainous region, characterized by rugged terrain and distant peaks under a cloudy sky. The environment suggests a cool, overcast day, with muted natural colors dominating the scene. The landscape features rolling hills and valleys, providing a sense of vastness and isolation. The focus is on a person positioned prominently in the foreground, wearing a light-colored cap and layered clothing, which includes a dark shirt with a yellow undershirt. The person's posture and expression suggest engagement with the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the natural backdrop providing a dramatic contrast to the human presence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
