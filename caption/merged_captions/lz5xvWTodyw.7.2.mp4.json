  "merged_caption": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, presenting a wide shot of an indoor hallway that extends from the foreground into the background, occupying the majority of the frame. A paper cutout of a cartoon character on a stick remains consistently positioned in the bottom right foreground. Initially, the hallway stretches forward, with light pink walls on the left and right, cream wainscoting along their base, and a deep red carpet running down the center, all receding into the background. Initially, there are two wall-mounted lamps in the middle ground. As the perspective moves forward, two additional lamps appear on both sides in the middle ground. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, moving forward with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The movement is slightly unsteady. The camera advances down the hallway, causing elements like framed pictures and additional lamps, located in the middle ground on the left and right walls, to eventually move out of frame. As the camera progresses, the doorway becomes more prominent, and the character on the stick remains in the foreground. A white arched wall niche, initially in the background center, becomes more prominent in the middle ground as the camera progresses, flanked by white door frames to its left and right, also moving from the background towards the middle ground. The video begins with a view of a long, pink-walled hallway with red carpet and wall-mounted lamps, and a hand-drawn cartoon character on a stick is visible in the foreground. The camera moves forward through the hallway, passing under the lamps and approaching a doorway. After passing through the doorway, the hallway continues to extend, with the same pink walls, red carpet, and framed pictures on the walls. The camera finally reaches the end of the hallway, revealing a white wall niche and two doorways leading to other pathways.",

    "Subject": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing movement through an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, a hand-drawn cartoon character on a white paper cutout, attached to a light brown wooden stick, is consistently visible. This character features a round head with messy, outlined hair, a small bow on the right side of its hair, two dot eyes, a simple curved line for a mouth, and a basic body outline. The hallway is characterized by light pink walls, darker cream wainscoting, a deep red carpet, and is lit by wall-mounted lamps with cream-colored shades; framed landscape pictures are also seen on the walls as the view progresses. At the end of the hallway, a white wall niche is embedded in the pink wall, with white door frames on both the left and right sides, each opening to other pathways.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, progresses down a long, narrow interior hallway. The walls maintain a consistent light pink color, featuring deeper cream wainscoting along the bottom. A continuous red carpet covers the floor. Warm light emanates from ornate wall-mounted lamps. Two doorways line the corridor, and two framed landscape pictures adorn the walls, positioned on the left and right sides. At the visible end of the hallway, there is an arched alcove containing a small shelf. In the lower right corner of the frame, there is a white paper cutout of a cartoon character, drawn with black lines and held on a wooden stick, as part of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
