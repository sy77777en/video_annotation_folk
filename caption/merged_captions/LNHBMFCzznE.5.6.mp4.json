  "merged_caption": "A medium shot shows a middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair standing in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the foreground. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern, a necklace, and a small microphone attached to an earpiece on her right ear. Initially, her body is facing the camera before she turns to the right of the frame, addressing an unseen audience. Her head is turned slightly to the right, and she gestures with her hands open, holding a small black object, likely a presentation remote, in her right hand to emphasize her points. The camera is filmed from a static, slightly unsteady, eye-level position, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the woman in sharp focus. In the background, vertical panels illuminated in vibrant blue are on the far left, while a stack of large, circular objects lit in blue is on the bottom right. The rest of the background is dark.",

    "Subject": "A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair stands on a stage, speaking. She is shown in profile, facing toward the right, with her head turned slightly to address an unseen audience. She wears a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern, a necklace, and a small microphone attached to an earpiece on her right ear. Her arms are bent at the elbows, and her hands are open in a gesturing motion. In her right hand, she holds a small black object, likely a presentation remote.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a stage, speaking and gesturing with her hands open. She holds a presentation remote in her right hand while moving both hands to emphasize her points. Her head is turned to the right of the frame as she addresses the audience.",
    "Scene": "A woman stands on a stage in front of a dark background. To the left, vertical panels are illuminated with a vibrant blue light. To the right, a stack of large, circular objects is also lit in blue. The woman is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress and has an earpiece with a microphone on her right ear.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot shows a woman standing in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Initially, her body is facing the camera before she turns to the right of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
