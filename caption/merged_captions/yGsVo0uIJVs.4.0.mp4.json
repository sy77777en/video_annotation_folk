  "merged_caption": "The video displays a full shot where a large, sepia-toned blueprint fills the foreground, marked by visible vertical creases indicating its age and previous folding. This extensive technical drawing, filled with intricate black ink lines, labels, and dimensions, depicts various elevations, plan views, and detailed deck layouts of a complex marine vessel, including side elevations, plan views, and cross-sections, with numerous annotations and measurements visible throughout. A thin, red, cylindrical object, possibly a pointer, is consistently visible in the upper right of the frame, positioned behind the blueprint, angled parallel to it, slanting from the upper left to the lower right. The scene is set against a plain, light-colored, out-of-focus background. Initially, the camera is positioned above the blueprint, looking down at it with a high angle, employing deep focus to keep the blueprints sharp with a large depth of field. The camera gradually approaches, bringing the blueprint into clearer focus, and transitions to a level angle as it moves. The camera movement is very smooth, exhibiting minor forward motion, a pan from left to right across the blueprints, and a downward movement. Consequently, the details of the drawing appear to move from the left towards the right side of the frame. Concurrently with this pan, the camera's height transitions from its initial position above the blueprint to become level with it. The red cylindrical object remains in the upper right corner throughout the approach.",

    "Camera": "The camera angle is initially high, looking down at the blueprints, and then transitions to a level angle as the camera moves. It's difficult to determine the camera height due to a lack of background information. The camera employs deep focus, keeping the blueprints sharp with a large depth of field. The camera movement is very smooth, exhibiting minor forward motion, a pan from left to right across the blueprints, and a downward movement.",
    "Subject": "The video displays a close-up of a large, sepia-toned blueprint. The paper is yellowed with age and shows distinct vertical creases, indicating it has been folded. The blueprint itself is covered in intricate black ink drawings, depicting various views of a complex vessel, likely a ship, with detailed side elevations, plan views of different decks, and cross-sections. Numerous annotations, labels, and measurements are visible throughout the drawings. In the upper right portion of the view, a thin, red, cylindrical object, possibly a pointer, is partially visible, positioned behind the blueprint, angled parallel to it, slanting from the upper left to the lower right within the upper right portion of the view.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a distant view of the blueprint, which is hanging on a wall. The camera gradually approaches, bringing the blueprint into clearer focus. The blueprint shows detailed technical drawings, including side elevations, plan views, and cross-sections of a vessel, with various annotations and labels. The red cylindrical object, which appears to be a pointer, remains in the upper right corner throughout the approach.",
    "Scene": "The scene presents a large, sepia-toned blueprint, marked by visible vertical creases that indicate its age and previous folding. This extensive technical drawing, filled with intricate lines, labels, and dimensions, depicts various elevations, plan views, and detailed deck layouts of a complex marine vessel. It is set against a plain, light-colored, out-of-focus background. A thin, red, rod-like object is partially visible in the upper right portion of the frame, angled downwards. The camera slowly pans across the surface of the blueprint, offering a clear and detailed observation of its design elements.",
    "Spatial": "The video displays a full shot where a large, sepia-toned blueprint fills the foreground. A thin, red, cylindrical object is consistently visible in the upper right of the frame, positioned behind the blueprint, while a plain, light-colored, out-of-focus surface forms the background. The camera, initially positioned above the blueprint, pans from left to right across its surface while approaching the blueprint; consequently, the details of the drawing appear to move from the left towards the right side of the frame. Concurrently with this pan, the camera's height transitions from its initial position above the blueprint to become level with it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
