  "merged_caption": "The video is a full shot, with the camera positioned at eye level and employing a shallow depth of field, focusing on a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a light-colored, mid-calf length dress. She stands in the center of the foreground on a cobblestone surface during the night, facing away from the camera. Directly in front of her, in the center middle ground, a light-colored, older-model bus with its headlights on illuminates her back and the ground near her feet. To the left and right of this central bus, other vintage buses are positioned in the middle ground. The scene is set outdoors in the early morning or at dusk, with a dim, blue-toned ambiance. In the background, a building with arched windows is visible across the top of the frame. As the clip progresses, the woman begins to raise her arms slowly, moving them from both sides of her hips to above her waist, slightly outwards to her sides.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "In the video, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a light-colored, mid-calf length dress, stands on a cobblestone surface during the night. She is positioned facing away from the camera, looking towards a group of parked, older-model buses that appear light-colored under the dim, blue-toned lighting. The bus directly in front of her has its headlights on, illuminating her back and the ground near her feet. Towards the end of the brief clip, she slightly raises her arms outwards to her sides.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands in the middle of a cobblestone street at night, facing a row of parked buses with their headlights on. She begins to raise her arms slowly, moving them from both sides of her hips to above her waist. The background consists of a building with arched windows, and the scene is dimly lit with a blue hue.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in the early morning or at dusk on a cobblestone street or plaza, where several vintage, light-colored buses are parked. A building with visible windows stands in the background. The overall ambiance is dim, with a blue tint, and the headlights of the central bus are illuminated, casting light forward. A person in a light-colored dress stands facing away from the camera, positioned in front of the illuminated bus.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A woman stands in the center of the foreground, facing away from the camera. Directly in front of her, in the center middle ground, a bus with its headlights on illuminates her front. To the left of this central bus, another bus is positioned in the middle ground, and a third bus is similarly positioned to the right of the central bus in the middle ground. A cobblestone surface occupies the foreground and extends into the middle ground beneath the woman and buses. In the background, a building is visible across the top of the frame. Towards the end of the clip, the woman in the center slightly raises her arms outwards to her sides."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
