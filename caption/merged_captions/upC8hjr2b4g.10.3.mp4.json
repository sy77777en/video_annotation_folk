  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a beige CRT computer monitor, centrally positioned in the middle ground, displaying a real-time strategy game map with a light-colored landmass surrounded by dark, unexplored areas. Game interface elements are visible at the bottom and right edges, and a subtitle overlay appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame, displaying white text: \"Yiffy Stiffy - Age of Empires II: HD Edition - 1 vs 7 Hardest AI - [Ethiopians] #1 (2017)\". The eye-level camera is angled straight ahead, maintaining a shallow focus with an emphasis on the middle ground. It steadily and smoothly moves backward, gradually revealing a beige keyboard and mouse, initially in the foreground, transitioning to the middle ground, resting on a dark wooden desk. As the camera continues to pull back, a white, low-polygon humanoid figure, seen from the chest up, becomes prominent in the foreground on the left side of the frame, with its hands positioned on the keyboard and mouse, interacting with the computer. The computer monitor shifts to the right side of the frame, remaining fully visible in the middle ground. The game map on the screen continues to uncover new territory, showing varied terrain including beige land, green patches representing vegetation, and areas of blue water. The background is dimly lit and indistinct, setting an indoor scene. The humanoid figure has stylized, angular features, including curly hair, and is engaged with the game, as the camera movement reveals the full composition of the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video initially focuses on an old, beige CRT computer monitor displaying a real-time strategy game. The game shows a map with a light-colored, irregularly shaped landmass, dotted with green elements resembling trees, against a dark, unexplored background. A game interface with text and icons is visible at the bottom and right of the screen. A subtitle overlay appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame throughout the video. As the view widens, a matching beige keyboard and mouse appear on a dark wooden desk in front of the monitor. Subsequently, a white, low-polygon humanoid figure is revealed sitting at the desk, interacting with the computer. This figure, seen from the chest up on the left side of the frame, has stylized, angular features, including curly hair, and its hands are positioned on the keyboard and mouse. The computer's screen remains fully visible on the right of the figure.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room, focusing on a beige, vintage CRT computer monitor placed on a dark wooden desk. The monitor displays a real-time strategy game, showing a map with varied terrain including beige land, green patches representing vegetation, and areas of blue water. A user interface for the game is visible at the bottom of the screen. A beige keyboard and mouse are positioned in front of the monitor. A white, low-poly, stylized human figure appears, with its hands interacting with the keyboard and mouse.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
