  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera-wearer's lower body and helmet occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, wearing light-colored pants, dark shoes with bright teal laces, and a black and green harness. A second skydiver, wearing a multicolored jumpsuit with orange, yellow, and red colors and a black helmet, is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a vast, arid landscape of brown and tan rolling hills and valleys filling the background. The camera starts at a high angle before tilting down to a bird's-eye view, revealing the ground and the other skydiver below. As the video progresses, the camera-wearer extends their legs, which move from the bottom center to frame the sides of the shot. Simultaneously, the second skydiver, initially facing the camera, raises both middle fingers before turning away, while remaining in the center, receding further into the distance and appearing to shrink in size as the gap between the two individuals increases. The slightly unsteady camera then tilts up slightly to recenter on the falling figure, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire landscape and the other person sharp. The scene captures a perspective looking straight down from high in the sky during a daytime scene, with a winding dirt path or dry riverbed visible below. The filming skydiver maintains their altitude, extending their legs outward, while the lower skydiver continues their descent. The bottom of the camera-wearer's black helmet is seen at the lower edge of the view, and the camera is positioned directly above the second person, looking down.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, the lower body of a person is visible, wearing light-colored pants, dark shoes with bright teal laces, and a black and green harness around their waist. The bottom of their black helmet is seen at the lower edge of the view. Positioned below and in the center is another person in freefall, seen from above. This second individual wears a multicolored jumpsuit featuring orange, yellow, and red colors, along with a black helmet. They are positioned with their back to the earth, both hands raised with the middle fingers extended.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a skydiver falls through the air while looking down at another skydiver below. The lower skydiver, initially facing the camera, raises both middle fingers before turning away. As the lower skydiver continues their descent, the filming skydiver maintains their altitude, extending their legs outward.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot captures a perspective looking straight down from high in the sky during a daytime scene. The vast, arid landscape below is a patchwork of brown and tan rolling hills and valleys, with a winding dirt path or dry riverbed visible. From the bottom of the view, the camera-wearer's black helmet and legs in light-colored pants are visible. Farther below, another person in a colorful jumpsuit is seen against the expansive terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
