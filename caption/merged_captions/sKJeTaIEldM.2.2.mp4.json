  "merged_caption": "A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, blondish, receding hair is shown in a close-up, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center and occupying the foreground. He wears a light blue collared shirt, a dark tie with diagonal stripes, and a white vest. A silver-colored metal band is visible on his right wrist, appearing on the left side of the frame as he faces the camera. He is equipped with a communications headset worn around his collar, including an earpiece in his left ear and a microphone extending towards his mouth. The man holds a black pen in his right hand, bringing his right fingers up to his right ear as he listens with a focused expression. His eyes shift slightly upward and to his right. The background consists of out-of-focus vertical panels. The camera, from an unsteady, low, eye-level angle, focuses on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. It performs a dolly zoom, moving backward while simultaneously zooming in on him, and is positioned at the man's eye level throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with out-of-focus vertical panels in the background, a man with short, light-colored hair is shown in a close-up. He wears a light blue collared shirt, a dark tie with diagonal stripes, and a white vest. A headset is fitted over his head, with an earpiece in his left ear and a small microphone positioned near his mouth.

He is angled toward the left of the frame, with his right hand holding a pen near his right ear. The background consists of out-of-focus vertical panels.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
