  "merged_caption": "This scene is framed as a low-angle medium shot filmed from hip level, using a static camera with a shallow depth of field. In the foreground, the out-of-focus upper half of a person's head with dark hair occupies the bottom center of the frame, turned sideways. The main subject, a man with dark, wavy hair and a beard, wearing a white t-shirt under a dark, unzipped jacket, stands in the middle ground, initially positioned in the center and looking down toward the foreground. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with beige walls, where a light fixture hangs from the ceiling, providing a warm, ambient glow. A framed picture hangs on a partition wall to the right. The man stands slightly shaking as he looks down toward the foreground. In the background, the light fixture is visible in the bottom left, while the partition wall with the framed picture is on the right. The man in the middle ground then turns to the left and walks toward the left, exiting the frame completely.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle shot filmed from hip level. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the man standing in the midground.",
    "Subject": "In the foreground, the out-of-focus upper half of a person's head with dark hair is visible at the bottom of the frame, turned sideways. The main subject, positioned in the middle ground and in sharp focus, is a man shown from the waist up. He has dark, wavy hair, a beard, and is wearing a white t-shirt under a dark, unzipped jacket. He initially stands looking down toward the foreground person before turning and walking out of the frame to the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
