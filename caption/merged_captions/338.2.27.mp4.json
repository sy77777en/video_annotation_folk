  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing the bustling activity within a restaurant. The camera is positioned at hip level with a high angle, looking down, using deep focus to maintain clarity across the scene. It moves steadily forward, initially tilting downward and then upward, capturing the restaurant setting smoothly with minimal shaking. The main subject, a person on a green hoverboard, enters from the right side of the frame and moves towards the center, transitioning from the right foreground to the center of the middle ground. The hoverboard rider, dressed in black pants and a dark shirt, navigates through the space without interacting with the tables. In the background, diners occupy various tables, with some individuals, such as a man in a striped shirt and jeans and a woman with long blonde hair in a pure muted beige top, situated in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. These patrons are seated and engaged in dining activities, seemingly unaware of the hoverboard rider's presence. A small, round, turquoise robotic vacuum is visible, moving along the floor in the middle ground, contributing to the busy atmosphere. A cart with dishes is positioned in the lower left corner of the foreground. The tables, covered with white tablecloths, and red-cushioned chairs are distributed throughout the middle ground, contributing to the restaurant's layout. The environment features a warm, inviting atmosphere with a geometric patterned carpet in shades of brown and red, adding to the cozy ambiance. The lighting is soft and ambient, typical of an evening dining experience, enhancing the overall warmth of the scene. The camera does not exhibit noticeable changes in height or angle, keeping the focus steady on the central action and surrounding environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
