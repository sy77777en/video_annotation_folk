  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot of a light gray sedan positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right in the middle ground, moving along a dark road marked with double yellow lines. Inside the car, two people are visible in the front seats; the person in the driver's seat is wearing a reddish-purple top. A large, green, glowing, three-dimensional British pound symbol (£) materializes in the center of the frame, hovering directly above the car's roof. The camera maintains a deep focus while tracking the moving car, moving backward and to the left at a 45-degree angle relative to the street. As the camera ascends, a portion of the car moves out of the frame, while the pound symbol enters from the top and remains centered throughout the movement, eventually settling slightly above the center of the frame. The scene is dimly lit, with a single light source casting a strong shadow from the vehicle.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, high-angle, overhead perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus while tracking a moving car. The camera moves backward and to the left at a 45-degree angle relative to the street. Midway through the shot, the camera ascends, causing the frame's center to shift upward and focus on the car's roof.",
    "Subject": "A light gray sedan is shown from a high angle in a dimly lit environment. Inside the car, two people are visible in the front seats; the person in the driver's seat is wearing a reddish-purple top. A large, green, glowing, three-dimensional British pound symbol (£) materializes and hovers directly above the car's roof.",
    "Motion": "A large, green, glowing, three-dimensional British pound symbol (£) materializes and hovers directly above the roof of a moving light gray sedan, which is traveling along the road towards the lower left corner of the frame. Inside the car, two people are visible sitting in the front seats, remaining stationary.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective at night, a silver sedan is moving along a dark road marked with double yellow lines. The scene is dimly lit, with a single light source casting a strong shadow from the vehicle. Inside the car, two figures are visible in the front seats. A glowing, green, three-dimensional pound sterling symbol hovers above the car's roof.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot of a car positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right in the middle ground. A green, glowing pound (£) symbol materializes in the center of the frame, hovering directly above the car's roof. As the camera ascends, a portion of the car moves out of the frame, while the pound symbol enters from the top and remains centered throughout the movement, eventually settling slightly above the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
