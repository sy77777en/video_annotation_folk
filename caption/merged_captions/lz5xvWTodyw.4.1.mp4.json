  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a stylized cityscape from a high-angle, aerial perspective, capturing a digitally rendered city resembling Paris. The scene is composed with the Eiffel Tower positioned in the background toward the top left, set against distant mountains and a hazy sky. A massive, red structure composed of hundreds of articulated bus sections dominates the foreground and middle ground, weaving intricately through the dense Parisian-style city blocks with light-colored facades and blue-grey mansard roofs that fill the majority of the frame from bottom to top. Each bus section is red on top, white on the bottom, and appears to have a wheel in the middle underneath. The camera initially ascends, using a deep focus to keep the entire cityscape sharp, then gradually rises throughout the clip, maintaining its elevated viewpoint while looking down upon the entire landscape. It tilts downward and pans slightly left, providing a dynamic fly-through perspective of this fantastical cityscape, offering a more direct overhead view of the city blocks and the bus sections, which are connected in a way that resembles a roller coaster track as they loop through the city, passing over streets and through building courtyards. The focus is on the juxtaposition of the historic city and the sprawling bus section structure, creating a unique and fantastical landscape. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"ESC or START to end fly cam.\" In the final second, the camera tilts downward and pans left to keep the structure made of articulated bus sections in frame, capturing the grand scale and surreal atmosphere of the entire scene.",

    "Camera": "This very smooth aerial drone shot captures a city, featuring the Eiffel Tower and a series of red and white articulated buses, from a high angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. Initially, the camera moves upward, then tilts down and pans slightly left to offer a more direct overhead view of the city blocks and the bus sections, which are connected in a way that resembles a roller coaster track as they loop through the city.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an expansive, aerial cityscape scenery shot of a stylized, 3D-rendered Paris, identifiable by the iconic Eiffel Tower in the background and dense blocks of Haussmann-style buildings. A massive, vibrant red structure, composed of hundreds of articulated bus sections, intricately weaves throughout the urban environment, looping over streets and around buildings. The tops of these bus sections are red, the bottoms are white, and there appears to be a wheel around the middle of each section. The structure is static and does not exhibit dynamic movement. There is no single main subject, as the camera's high-angle, sweeping view is designed to capture the grand scale and surreal atmosphere of the entire scene. The focus is on the juxtaposition of the historic city and the sprawling bus section structure, creating a unique and fantastical landscape.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a digitally rendered, sweeping aerial view of a city resembling Paris, complete with the Eiffel Tower in the background. A massive and intricate red roller coaster track winds its way through the city streets, weaving between and over the buildings. The camera initially ascends, then gradually tilts downward while panning to the left, providing a dynamic fly-through perspective of this fantastical cityscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a stylized representation of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background against a hazy sky and distant mountains. The daytime scene is dominated by dense, Parisian-style city blocks with light-colored facades and blue-grey mansard roofs. A massive, intricate chain of hundreds of articulated bus sections weaves throughout the city, passing over streets and through building courtyards. Each bus section is red on top, white on the bottom, and appears to have a wheel in the middle underneath. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"ESC or START to end fly cam\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
