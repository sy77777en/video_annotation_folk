  "merged_caption": "This wide, first-person POV shot begins from the perspective of a person in the process of crossing a city street. The shot features noticeable barrel distortion. Initially, a man in a black and white patterned short-sleeved shirt with blue jeans is in the center-left foreground. As the camera tilts forward and moves across the white-striped crosswalk on the dark asphalt, pedestrians, including several men and women dressed in casual summer attire, move forward and exit the frame to both the left and right. A man in a black t-shirt, yellow shorts, and a baseball cap walks across the street. This movement reveals more of the middle ground, where a cyclist on a black bicycle rides from left to right across the intersection just ahead of the man in yellow shorts. The camera pans left while moving forward, positioning a white police car with its lights on in the center-left of the middle ground. In the background, other people cross the street, and vehicles, including a stopped police car, a stationary yellow taxi, and a black SUV, are visible in the intersection. The scene is set with the low sun casting long shadows and bathing the urban landscape in a warm, golden light against a clear blue sky. Tall buildings, including red-brick structures and taller, light-colored high-rises, and large, leafy green trees line one side of the street, forming the background across the entire frame. A water tower is visible in the distance. The camera is positioned at approximately eye-level, creating an immersive perspective of walking through the scene. The handheld movement simulates a person walking across the street, featuring smooth but slightly shaky panning to the left and forward motion, with a varying Dutch angle due to slight camera rolling. The camera uses deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "A group of pedestrians crosses a city street at a crosswalk. The group includes several men and women dressed in casual summer attire. A man in the foreground wears a black and white patterned short-sleeved shirt with blue jeans, while another man next to him is in a black collared shirt and light-colored pants. A man in a black t-shirt, yellow shorts, and a baseball cap walks across the street. A cyclist on a black bicycle rides through the intersection. In the middleground, vehicles, including a white police car with its lights on, a yellow taxi, and a black SUV, are stopped or moving through the intersection. Other people can be seen walking on the sidewalks.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera tilts forward, capturing various individuals walking across a city street on a crosswalk. A person on a bicycle rides across the intersection just ahead of a man wearing yellow shorts. In the background, other people cross the street, and vehicles, including a stopped police car and a stationary yellow taxi, are visible in the intersection.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the experience of walking across a wide city street at an intersection. The scene is set with the low sun casting long shadows and bathing the urban landscape in a warm, golden light against a clear blue sky. Pedestrians and a cyclist move across the white-striped crosswalk on the dark asphalt. The intersection is surrounded by multi-story buildings, including red-brick structures and taller, light-colored high-rises, with a water tower visible in the distance. Large, leafy green trees line one side of the street. In the middleground, a yellow taxi and a police vehicle are parked on the side of the road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
