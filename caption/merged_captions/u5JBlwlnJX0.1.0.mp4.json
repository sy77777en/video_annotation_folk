  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman with dark hair pulled back stands in the middle ground, left of center, on a grassy hill, holding a long, dark staff vertically behind her with her right hand positioned on the lower part of it. She wears a light-colored top with dark sleeves, dark pants, and has a bag slung over her shoulder. Positioned slightly closer to the camera, a cloaked figure stands in the center of the frame, wearing a long, hooded, light brown cloak that conceals their form. The two figures stand still, facing each other on a cliffside overlooking a vast, grey-blue sea. A low stone wall runs across the foreground from the left, while a large rock formation occupies the foreground on the right. The sea fills the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The camera, positioned above the subjects, smoothly arcs clockwise, capturing the rugged, coastal landscape under an overcast sky. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus held on the rocks and stone wall in the foreground. Large, weathered rock formations, some marked with yellow lichen, are scattered across the terrain, particularly on the right side of the scene.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera smoothly arcs clockwise. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus held on the rocks and stone wall in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A woman with dark hair pulled back stands on a grassy hill, holding a long, dark staff vertically behind her with her right hand positioned on the lower part of it. She wears a light-colored top with dark sleeves, dark pants, and has a bag slung over her shoulder. In front of her and on slightly lower ground, another person stands with their back to the viewer, wearing a long, hooded, light brown cloak that conceals their form. The two figures appear to be facing each other on a cliffside.",
    "Motion": "Two figures stand still on a grassy cliffside overlooking the water. One person, carrying a staff, and another person in a cloak remain motionless, facing each other.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide shot of a rugged, coastal landscape under an overcast sky. A green, grassy hill slopes down towards a vast, grey-blue sea. A low wall constructed from dark, stacked stones runs along the hillside. Large, weathered rock formations, some marked with yellow lichen, are scattered across the terrain, particularly on the right side of the scene. Two figures stand on the hill against the backdrop of the water.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a woman with a staff stands in the middle ground, left of center, on a grassy hill. Positioned slightly closer to the camera, a cloaked figure stands in the center of the frame. A low stone wall runs across the foreground from the left, while a large rock formation occupies the foreground on the right. The sea fills the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
