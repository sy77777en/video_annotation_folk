  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a scientific setup in a laboratory, featuring a transparent container on a perforated surface at the center of the frame. Inside the container, a glass cup is centrally positioned. In the foreground, a hand with a white glove holds a green electrical plug on the left, while an arm with white sleeves is visible on the right. These elements are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. The background is dark, providing contrast to the setup. The camera starts at hip level, looking straight ahead with a shallow focus on the middle ground, specifically on the object inside the container. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward smoothly, transitioning from a full shot to a medium shot, bringing the container into greater focus and filling more of the frame. As it approaches the container rapidly, motion blur occurs, causing the entire frame to become blurry. Initially, the hand holding the green electrical plug suggests an interaction with the setup, but it disappears as the camera advances. The video concludes with a closer view of the glass cup, highlighting its details within the container. The environment is characterized by a neutral black background, providing a sterile and controlled atmosphere. The lighting is even, highlighting the clarity and precision of the setup. In the lower left corner, the overlay white text changes from [24, 35] to [26]. The video maintains an objective perspective, capturing the scene with a detached, observational view.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, looking straight ahead with a shallow focus on the middle ground, specifically on the object inside the container. The camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining steadiness. As it approaches the container rapidly, motion blur occurs, causing the entire frame to become blurry.",
    "Subject": "The video features a scientific setup in a laboratory setting. Central to the scene is a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. The container is the primary focus, with its details becoming clearer as the camera moves closer. On the left, a hand, wearing a white glove, holds a green electrical plug, suggesting an interaction with the setup. On the right, a small part of another humanoid figure's arm is visible, also clad in white, indicating the presence of another person. The background is dark, emphasizing the laboratory equipment and the actions of the individuals involved.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a distant view of a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. As the camera moves closer, the details of the container and the glass cup become more visible. Initially, a hand holding a green electrical plug is in the frame, suggesting an interaction with the setup, but it disappears as the camera advances. The camera continues to zoom in, focusing more on the glass cup inside the container. The video concludes with a closer view of the glass cup, highlighting its details within the container.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor laboratory setting with a focus on a transparent container placed on a perforated metal surface. The container, made of clear material, holds a cylindrical object at its center. The environment is characterized by a neutral black background, providing a sterile and controlled atmosphere. Notable elements initially include a pair of gloved hands on either side of the scene, one holding a green tool with a metallic tip, but these hands are no longer visible as the camera moves forward towards the container. The lighting is even, highlighting the clarity and precision of the setup. In the lower left corner, the overlay white text changes from [24, 35] to [26]. The video maintains an objective perspective, capturing the scene with a detached, observational view.",

The camera maintains a consistent perspective relative to the setup throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
