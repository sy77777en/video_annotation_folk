  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a view of a city sidewalk bordered by a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field, and moves forward along the sidewalk, keeping the walkway and street in focus. As the camera progresses, it reveals a street intersection with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. Traffic is light, with cars moving in an orderly fashion and a few parked along the roadside. The background features lush green trees partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, and a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the center of the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly. The scene is presented as a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving along the city sidewalk. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, immersing the viewer in the setting itself. The camera slightly pans left at the end, with movement that is slightly unsteady with some shaking, enhancing the first-person perspective. The area appears calm and orderly, creating a peaceful scene typical of an urban environment. The intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
