  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a stylized puppet character with exaggerated facial features, including large eyes and a prominent nose, seated at a table in an indoor setting resembling a cafeteria or dining area. The puppet, with short, dark hair, black eyebrows, and wearing a red plaid jacket over a light-colored shirt with green lettering, occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Its upper body, from the waist up, is visible. The table with two blue cups is directly in front of the puppet; one cup is on a tray in the foreground, and the other is in the middle ground. The puppet's head is turned slightly, suggesting it is looking to the side. The puppet begins speaking and places its hand on its chest, then gestures with its hand while continuing to speak. It raises its index finger and points upwards, emphasizing a point, before turning its head back to the front, continuing to speak. In the background, blurred figures and elements suggest a busy dining area, with one figure sitting on a stool in the background towards the right. Yellow caution tape runs horizontally across the background, adding depth to the scene. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor settings, with a mix of warm and cool tones. Notable visual elements include the character's red plaid jacket and the blue and white cups on the table. The setting is enhanced by the presence of yellow caution tape in the background, adding a distinct visual element. Overlays include a small logo in the bottom left corner, indicating branding or network identification. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking straight ahead, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the character in the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout, maintaining a steady position at the puppet's level, keeping the focus on the puppet's actions and expressions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
