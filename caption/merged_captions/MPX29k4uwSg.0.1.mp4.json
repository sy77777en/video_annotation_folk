  "merged_caption": "This is a static close-up shot focusing on the lower portion of a weathered wooden fence post, which occupies the foreground on the left side of the frame. Barbed wire is wrapped around the post, and a slack strand forms a semi-circular shape slightly to the left of the center. Snow covers the bottom of the frame, with a few stalks of dry grass visible at the bottom left near the post's base. In the out-of-focus background, a snow-covered barn is situated in the upper-center-right, with faint silhouettes of trees visible in the distant background on both the far left and right sides. The camera is positioned at a level angle, aligned with the snow at the base of the post, and remains completely still throughout the shot. From a slightly unsteady, fixed position at ground level, the camera maintains a level angle. The focus is shallow, keeping the wooden fence post and barbed wire in the foreground sharp while the barn in the distance is blurred. In a snowy landscape, the post is constructed from several dark gray, textured wooden poles with distinct grain patterns, bound together by wraps of barbed wire. A loose strand of barbed wire hangs in a semi-circular shape in front of it. Snow is piled around the base of the post, with a few stalks of dry, brown grass poking through. Beyond the fence, a vast, white, snow-covered field stretches towards the horizon under an overcast sky. In the blurred distance, a dark, rustic barn with a snow-dusted roof is visible, flanked by the faint silhouettes of bare trees. This is a still shot with no discernible movement.",

    "Scene": "In a stark winter landscape, a weathered gray wooden fence post wrapped in barbed wire stands in the foreground, partially buried in deep snow. A single strand of wire hangs in a loose loop beside it, with some dry, brown grass visible at the base of the post. Beyond the fence, a vast, white, snow-covered field stretches towards the horizon under an overcast sky. In the blurred distance, a dark, rustic barn with a snow-dusted roof is visible, flanked by the faint silhouettes of bare trees.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
