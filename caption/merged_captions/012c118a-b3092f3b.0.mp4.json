  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a night street scene from a vehicle's perspective on Bedford Avenue. Initially, a white Toyota sedan is moving forward in the center of the frame, located in the middle ground, before it stops at a red traffic light with its brake lights illuminated. The sedan's right indicator light is on, signaling a turn. To its left is a dark-colored SUV with a spare tire mounted on its rear door, and to its right are a dark sedan, a white SUV, and a dark SUV, all stationary in the middle ground. In the middle ground, red traffic lights are visible in the upper center. The traffic lights then switch from red to green, but the white sedan remains stationary. The vehicles in the adjacent lanes also do not move forward, and the camera car stays behind the white sedan. Throughout the shot, reflections of taillights are visible on the car hood at the bottom of the frame, in the foreground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves forward from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective while maintaining a level angle, capturing the scene with a deep focus that keeps the entire street view relatively sharp. The street is flanked by dark buildings and illuminated by streetlights and the red glow of traffic signals and vehicle taillights. In the background, only one person is visible crossing the street. Reflections of the traffic lights and the sedan's red taillights and brake light can be seen. As the camera vehicle moves forward, the white sedan in the center appears larger in the frame, while the vehicles on the left and right remain stationary. The license plate of the white sedan is visible, and the high-mounted third brake light is blinking brightly.",

    "Subject": "This video, shot from a dashcam at night, centers on a white Toyota sedan stopped at an intersection. The sedan's red taillights, a high-mounted third brake light, and its right turn signal lights are blinking brightly, and its license plate is visible. To the left of the white sedan is a dark-colored SUV with a spare tire mounted on its rear door. To the right, there are three vehicles: a dark sedan, a white SUV, and a dark SUV. The traffic lights ahead are initially red, then switch to green. In the background, only one person is visible crossing the street. Reflections of the traffic lights and the sedan's red taillights and brake light can be seen.",
    "Motion": "A white sedan approaches the stop line and comes to a complete stop at a red traffic light with its brake lights illuminated. The sedan's right indicator light is on, signaling a turn. When the traffic light turns green, the sedan remains stationary. The vehicles in the adjacent lanes also do not move forward, and the camera car stays behind the white sedan.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a scene on a city street at night. The vehicle is stopped behind a white sedan at an intersection on Bedford Avenue, with other cars visible on either side. The street is flanked by dark buildings and illuminated by streetlights and the red glow of traffic signals and vehicle taillights. The traffic lights then switch from red to green.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
