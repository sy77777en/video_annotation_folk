  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a person in ski gear, dressed in a black jacket with contrasting off-white sleeves and black puffy pants, positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. They wear a black glove on their left hand, holding a metal pole with red accents, possibly a ski pole or a selfie stick, in the bottom foreground. The scene is set on a wide, snow-covered slope during an overcast day, bordered by a dense forest of bare, thin-trunked trees under a flat white sky. A red and black rectangular object is visible to the right, in the middle ground, next to the forest that recedes into the background. The shot transitions to a medium full shot as the person skis down the slope, gliding forward with their knees bent, moving past the bare trees. The camera, in a slow-motion, selfie-perspective shot, leads the skier from the front, moving backward and downward, transitioning from hip-level to ground-level, which shifts the view from a level to a low angle. The shot is slightly unsteady and features a varying Dutch angle from camera rolling, a gentle upward tilt, and a deep focus. The snow-covered slope extends from the foreground into the background, maintaining the skier at the subject's level throughout the motion.",

    "Subject": "The video is shown from a selfie point of view, featuring a person dressed in winter ski attire. They are wearing a black jacket with contrasting off-white sleeves. Their pants are black and puffy. On their left hand, they wear a black glove and are holding a metal pole, possibly a ski pole or a selfie stick, which also has red accents on the handle.",
    "Motion": "From a selfie perspective, a person skis down a snowy slope, gliding forward with their knees bent as they move past bare trees.",
    "Scene": "In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, the scene is set on a wide, snow-covered slope during an overcast day. The path is bordered by a dense forest of bare, thin-trunked trees under a flat white sky. To the side of the slope, a red and black rectangular object is visible.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot of a person in ski gear, who is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. A pole, held by the person, remains in the bottom foreground. The shot then transitions to a medium full shot as the person moves down a snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. To the right, in the middle ground, a red and black rectangular object is visible next to a forest of bare trees that recedes into the background. The camera remains at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
