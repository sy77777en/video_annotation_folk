  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective, featuring a slightly unsteady, eye-level view with mild barrel distortion. Initially, the frame is dominated by a tiled room, emphasizing a circular light in the left middle ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it moves slowly forward through a long, eerie hallway with tiled walls and repeating archways. The space is filled with a hazy, greenish-yellow light from two round lamps, one on the left wall and another on the right, along with a brighter source at the far end. As the camera pans and moves forward, it reveals a tiled wall on the right with a circular light in the right middle ground, leading into a corridor. A series of repeating arches recedes from the middle ground into the background, creating a central corridor. As the camera moves forward through the corridor at eye level, a bright light source at the far end of the passage in the background becomes more visible, revealing a set of stairs. The circular light on the right wall moves from the right middle ground to the right foreground before exiting the frame. The perspective is from a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, moving forward through the long, hazy corridor with a distinct greenish-yellow color cast. The walls and floor are uniformly covered in a grid of small, square tiles. The scene is dimly illuminated by two glowing circular light fixtures, one on the right-hand wall and another on the left-hand wall, along with a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the unsettling and seemingly endless nature of the environment itself, emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation and mystery over any particular entity.",

    "Camera": "Shot from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, this video features mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It moves forward through a hallway before rapidly panning right to round a corner.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a long, eerie corridor with a distinct liminal quality. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, greenish-yellow tiles, and the space recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches, creating a disorienting effect. The scene is dimly illuminated by two glowing circular light fixtures, one on the right-hand wall and another on the left-hand wall, along with a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the unsettling and seemingly endless nature of the environment itself, emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation and mystery over any particular entity.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot that moves slowly through a long, eerie hallway with tiled walls and repeating archways. The space is filled with a hazy, greenish-yellow light from two round lamps, one on the left wall and another on the right, along with a brighter source at the far end. There are no moving subjects within the scene.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the perspective moves forward through a long, hazy corridor with a distinct greenish-yellow color cast. The walls and floor are uniformly covered in a grid of small, square tiles. The space is defined by a series of repeating, rounded archways that create a tunnel-like passage. Two circular, flush-mounted lights, one on each wall, illuminate the immediate area. An unidentified light source at the far end of the corridor limits visibility, partially obscuring the length of the hallway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
