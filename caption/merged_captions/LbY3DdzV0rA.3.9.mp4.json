  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape from a low-angle perspective, capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night. A starry sky occupies the top portion of the frame in the background, while a large storm cloud dominates the center and left of the frame in the middle ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and includes a slow, smooth pan from right to left. The primary motion consists of dramatic flashes of lightning that repeatedly illuminate the massive cloud formation from within, revealing its turbulent structure in shades of white and purple against the starry sky. Bright bolts of lightning also strike down from the cloud towards the dark horizon on the right side of the frame, connecting the middle ground to the background. In the bottom left background, the silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with a line of lights at its base along the horizon, possibly from a distant town or highway. The scene is dynamically altered by these intermittent flashes of lightning, enhancing the dramatic impact of the natural phenomenon. The composition emphasizes the scale and atmosphere, with the vast, dark storm cloud dominating the frame and the brilliant flashes of lightning lighting up the cloud from within. In the far distance to the left, the dark silhouette of a mountain range is visible above a string of bright lights on the ground, adding depth to the scene. The camera height appears to be between eye-level and overhead-level, although it is difficult to determine precisely due to the absence of nearby reference points. This time-lapse video captures the evolving dynamics of the thunderstorm, providing a comprehensive view of the powerful natural event.",

    "Subject": "This dramatic landscape scenery shot captures a powerful thunderstorm under a starry night sky, with a focus on the striking bolts of lightning that intermittently illuminate the scene. The composition emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the natural phenomenon, with a vast, dark storm cloud dominating the frame. Brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning light up the cloud from within, while powerful bolts strike down towards the ground on the right, enhancing the dramatic impact. In the distance on the left, the dark silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with the warm, scattered lights of a distant town or highway glowing at its base.",
    "Motion": "This time-lapse video captures a powerful thunderstorm at night. The primary motion consists of dramatic flashes of lightning that repeatedly illuminate a massive cloud formation from within, revealing its turbulent structure against a starry sky. In the distance, the dark silhouettes of mountains and the faint glow of city lights are visible on the horizon.",
    "Scene": "A nighttime view captures a vast, dark landscape under a star-filled sky. A massive, dark storm cloud occupies the center of the frame. Powerful flashes of lightning intermittently illuminate the cloud from within, revealing its billowing structure in shades of white and purple. Bright bolts of lightning also strike down from the cloud towards the dark horizon on the right. In the far distance to the left, the silhouette of a mountain range is visible above a string of bright lights on the ground.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape from a low-angle perspective. A starry sky occupies the top portion of the frame in the background. A large storm cloud dominates the center and left of the frame in the middle ground. In the bottom left background, the silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with a line of lights at its base along the horizon. The scene is dynamically altered by intermittent flashes of lightning that illuminate the central cloud from within and by bolts that strike down from the cloud on the right side of the frame, connecting the middle ground to the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
