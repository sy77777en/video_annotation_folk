  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot, captured from an eye-level perspective, begins with a person with pink hair in the bottom-right foreground. The camera then pans to the right, causing the person to exit the frame as the view shifts to an intersection. Initially, the crosswalk is in the center middle ground, but as the camera moves, it expands to occupy the foreground and middle ground of the frame. A silver sedan enters from the right and stops in the right middle ground, while other cars are visible in the right-center background. The final frame shows the intersection centrally, with trees in the left middle ground and a large building in the right background. This slightly unsteady, eye-level shot pans right across a street intersection, maintaining a level angle throughout. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle due to camera roll. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The scene is set at dusk under an overcast sky, with illuminated, classic-style lampposts lining the sidewalk and active traffic lights. The area is surrounded by numerous trees, some with green leaves and others with bare branches. In the background, multi-story brick buildings and a low stone wall are visible. A blue street sign reads \"SE UNIVERSITY AVE\". The camera's wide, panning view is intended to capture the overall atmosphere and environment, establishing a sense of place within this campus-like setting rather than highlighting any single person or object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an urban scenery shot of a street corner at dusk. The scene begins with a pedestrian with pink hair walking on the sidewalk, adding a splash of color to the setting. The focus then shifts to an intersection with a crosswalk, where a silver sedan and other vehicles pass through. The area is lined with a mix of brick and modern buildings, surrounded by numerous large, leafy trees under an overcast sky, with streetlights already illuminated. The camera's wide, panning view is intended to capture the overall atmosphere and environment, establishing a sense of place within this campus-like setting rather than highlighting any single person or object.",
    "Motion": "This point-of-view video captures a street corner, likely on a university campus, during twilight. The camera pans from a sidewalk view to a wider shot of an intersection. The scene includes a crosswalk, streetlights, trees, and buildings, with a few cars passing by.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a street corner at dusk under an overcast sky. The camera pans across an intersection with white crosswalk markings on the asphalt. Illuminated, classic-style lampposts line the sidewalk, and traffic lights are active. The area is surrounded by numerous trees, some with green leaves and others with bare branches. In the background, multi-story brick buildings and a low stone wall are visible. A person with pink hair is seen from behind on the sidewalk, while cars, including a silver sedan, move in front of the crosswalk through the intersection. A blue street sign reads \"SE UNIVERSITY AVE\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
