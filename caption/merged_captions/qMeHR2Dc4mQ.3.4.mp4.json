  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of an elderly man with gray, slightly wavy hair, positioned centrally in the foreground. He is wearing a dark green, collared, button-up shirt. His head and upper shoulders are visible, and his skin appears wrinkled, particularly on his forehead and around his eyes. The man is looking straight ahead, speaking with a slight, knowing smile on his face and gently shaking his head to convey his emotions. The scene is set indoors, in a room with moderate lighting and a plain, light-colored wall in the background, where a faint, out-of-focus rectangular shape, possibly a picture frame, is visible in the top left of the frame. The lighting is warm and subdued, casting soft shadows. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking straight ahead, and uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. It shows some minor, very smooth, slow forward movement. The man's head moves slightly as he speaks and shakes it, but his overall position within the frame remains constant.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
