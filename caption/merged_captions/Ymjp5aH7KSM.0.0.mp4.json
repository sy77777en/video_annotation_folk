  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a man in a black leather jacket in profile on the left side of the frame in the foreground. Just around the corner from him, a bearded man is positioned in the middle ground on the right, facing toward the camera. The table itself occupies the bottom center of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, holding a sheet of white paper, a glass of water, a German military-style peaked cap, and dark gloves. In the background, a window is visible on the top left. The camera, at eye level, features a shallow depth of field and executes a very smooth, slow clockwise arc around the subjects. As the camera moves, the man in the jacket, who is light-skinned and middle-aged with styled brown hair, is seen writing on the paper with a pen, while the bearded man, also light-skinned and middle-aged with short dark hair, watches intently. The perspective shifts from a side view of the men to a view from behind the man who is writing, showing his back in the center foreground, while the bearded man moves to the left side of the frame, turning into a profile view. Light from small-paned windows filters into the dimly lit, rustic room, which contains a wooden staircase and other simple furnishings in the background. By the end of the shot, the jacketed man's back is in the right foreground, and the bearded man is in the left foreground, with two background windows now visible: one in the center right and one on the far left. Near the end, the bearded man moves his right arm to support his head, while the two men remain largely still, maintaining their focused interaction across the table.",

    "Camera": "An eye-level, level-angle shot features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the two men seated at a table. The camera executes a very smooth, slow clockwise arc around them.",
    "Subject": "Two men are seated across from each other at a wooden table in a dimly lit room. The man initially on the left is light-skinned and middle-aged, with styled brown hair. He wears a black leather jacket and is shown in profile, leaning forward to write on a paper. The second man, seated opposite him, is also light-skinned and middle-aged, with short dark hair and a full dark beard. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt with suspenders and leans forward with one fist resting on top of the other, looking intently at the man who is writing. As the view circles around them, the man in the jacket is seen from behind, while the bearded man is shown in profile, with both men maintaining their positions and focused interaction across the table.",
    "Motion": "A man in a black leather jacket writes on a paper at a wooden table while a bearded man seated opposite him watches intently. The camera slowly circles around the table in a clockwise direction, from right to left, shifting the perspective from a side view of the men to a view from behind the man who is writing, and then back to a side view. Near the end, the bearded man moves his right arm to support his head, while the two men remain largely still, maintaining their focused interaction.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a dimly lit, rustic room during the day. A large wooden table serves as the focal point, holding a sheet of white paper, an inkwell, a glass of water, a German military-style peaked cap, and dark gloves. One of the men is holding a pen and writing on the paper. The two men are seated near each other, separated by the corner of the table. Light from small-paned windows filters into the dark interior, which contains a wooden staircase and other simple furnishings in the background. The perspective slowly shifts, orbiting the table and altering the view of the two figures and the room around them.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a man in a leather jacket in profile on the left side of the frame in the foreground. Just around the corner from him, a bearded man is positioned in the middle ground on the right, facing toward the camera. The table itself occupies the bottom center of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, holding a paper, a glass, and a military cap. In the background, a window is visible on the top left. The camera then performs a slow, clockwise orbital movement around the subjects. This motion shifts the man in the jacket to the center foreground, showing his back, while the bearded man moves to the left side of the frame, turning into a profile view. By the end of the shot, the jacketed man's back is in the right foreground, and the bearded man is in the left foreground, with two background windows now visible: one in the center right and one on the far left. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
