  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, level-angle scenery shot of Venice, Italy, on a clear, sunny day. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a large expanse of greenish-blue water in the foreground, with numerous boats, including water taxis and smaller vessels, moving in various directions across its surface, leaving white wakes behind them. The city's iconic waterfront extends horizontally across the middle ground, with crowds of people gathered along the promenade in front of the historic buildings. A tall bell tower, St. Mark's Campanile, with its green, pointed roof, is positioned in the center of the frame, rising from the middle ground. To its right is the ornate, white Doge's Palace with its distinctive arched colonnade, and to its left are other waterfront buildings, including one with a large blue and white banner. The rest of the cityscape, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, fills the background, stretching behind the main landmarks under a bright blue sky with a few wispy clouds. In the background, a wider expanse of water is visible, and on the horizon, other parts of the city can be seen. The video is a time-lapse shot from an aerial level at a level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire cityscape of Venice and the waterfront in sharp detail. The camera exhibits minor, very smooth movement while slowly zooming out, providing a broader view of the entire scene and maintaining a steady view of the city and the water traffic as time rapidly passes. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the harmonious blend of architecture and natural elements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
