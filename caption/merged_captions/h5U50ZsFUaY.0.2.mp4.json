  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot filmed from above, a person wearing a red long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a backpack is suspended in a harness beneath a large, black and blue speed wing, consistently located in the lower-center-left of the frame, flying low over the water's surface as they approach the shore. Initially positioned in the middle ground, they transition to the foreground due to camera movements. A body of water initially occupies the bottom left foreground and middle ground, later shifting to the center and left foreground to middle ground as a result of camera movements. The middle ground consists of rocky slopes on the left and right, while a large mountain peak is visible in the center-left background at the end of the video. A grassy shore is present in the bottom right foreground. This overhead, level-angle shot features a very smooth camera movement that arcs counterclockwise and moves downward, tracking the speed flyer near a mountain lake. Mild barrel distortion is visible, and a deep focus keeps the entire mountain scene sharp. The video captures a scene in a rugged, alpine mountain valley under a clear blue sky. Steep, gray, rocky cliffs and scree slopes surround a calm body of water extending from the foreground to the middleground, whose dark surface reflects the scenery. Patches of coniferous trees and dry, brownish-yellow grasses dot the landscape. A prominent, flat-topped mountain peak is visible in the distance.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a red long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a backpack is suspended in a harness beneath a large, black and blue speed wing. They are seen gliding low over the ground and a body of water.",
    "Motion": "A person suspended from a speed wing glides downward, flying low over a rocky landscape near a body of water.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in a rugged, alpine mountain valley under a clear blue sky. Steep, gray, rocky cliffs and scree slopes surround a calm body of water extending from the foreground to the middleground, whose dark surface reflects the scenery. Patches of coniferous trees and dry, brownish-yellow grasses dot the landscape. A single individual glides with a large, black and blue paragliding wing, flying low over the terrain and nearing the shore by the water's edge. A prominent, flat-topped mountain peak is visible in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
