  "merged_caption": "This scenery video is captured in an extreme wide shot from a low angle, looking up at the sky from ground level. A massive, rotating supercell cloud with a distinct, layered, saucer-like structure dominates the center and upper portions of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The video is a dramatic time-lapse of this colossal storm cloud at night, with internal lightning intermittently illuminating the stacked structure from within, causing it to glow with an eerie purple and white light. The camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right, following the cloud formation as it appears to slowly rotate and drift in the same direction. Below the cloud, a dark, flat horizon line sits in the background at the very bottom of the frame, where a small, stationary green light is visible on the bottom left. The sky behind and within the cloud formation is intermittently illuminated by flashes of purple and white lightning, primarily in the upper-right and central areas of the frame, revealing its turbulent texture. A visible column of precipitation falls from the center-bottom of the cloud, extending from the middle ground down towards the background landscape. On the distant horizon, a few small lights are visible. The deep focus utilized keeps the entire dramatic cloud structure and the lightning within it sharp and clear, emphasizing the immense scale and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the storm, which functions as the environment itself. The storm appears to hover over the dark landscape as it evolves and unleashes a curtain of rain, creating a powerful weather phenomenon that captivates the viewer.",

    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a powerful weather phenomenon at night. The video lacks a traditional main subject as the focus is entirely on the immense scale and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the storm, which functions as the environment itself. A colossal, rotating supercell cloud with a distinct, layered, saucer-like structure dominates the dark sky. The upper portions of the cloud are brilliantly and intermittently illuminated from within by flashes of purple and white lightning, starkly contrasting with its dark, shadowy underside from which a visible column of rain falls toward the silhouetted horizon.",

    "Scene": "At night, a massive, layered storm cloud dominates the sky over a dark, flat landscape. The cloud, shaped like a large, rotating saucer, is silhouetted in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
