  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, positioning a man in a dark coat and hat, carrying a brown suitcase in the center of the frame, walking within the middle ground along a wet dirt path. A wooden fence lines the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while bare, thin trees occupy the middle ground and background. The scene is set in a dimly lit, possibly rainy environment, with an overcast sky and light rain creating puddles scattered with leaves. A single streetlamp on a wooden pole stands in the left background, providing some illumination. As the man walks from left to right, the camera, from a smooth, eye-level first-person perspective with deep focus, moves slightly backward and then pans to the right to follow him. This movement causes the man to shift to the left side of the frame before he exits it completely. The pan continues more quickly to the right and tilts up slightly, eventually moving past the man and coming to a stop to reveal a large, multi-story house painted dark green with a porch and lit windows in the left-center background, situated behind the trees and fence. The house, surrounded by a fence and additional trees, suggests the man's destination or a significant location within the scene. A small, white circular reticle, an overlay element, remains fixed in the center of the shot throughout.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, eye-level first-person perspective with a deep focus, the camera moves slightly backward and then pans right to follow a man carrying a suitcase. It then pans more quickly to the right and tilts up slightly, revealing a large house in the distance.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man walking along a path lined with bare trees. He is wearing a dark coat and hat, carrying a brown suitcase. The scene is set in a dimly lit, possibly rainy environment. As the video progresses, the camera pans right, causing the man to eventually disappear from the frame. This movement reveals a large, multi-story building with numerous windows in the background, suggesting the man's destination or a significant location within the scene. The building is surrounded by a fence and additional trees, contributing to the overall atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "A man carrying a suitcase walks along a dirt path from left to right. As he proceeds, the camera pans to the right, eventually moving past the man, who then exits the frame on the left. The pan continues, coming to a stop to reveal a large, multi-story house in the background.",
    "Scene": "A gloomy, outdoor scene unfolds at night on a wet dirt road flanked by a dark wooden fence and a grove of bare, thin trees. The sky is overcast, and a light rain falls, creating puddles on the ground scattered with leaves. A single streetlamp on a wooden pole provides some illumination. As the view pans to the right, a large, multi-story house, painted dark green with a porch and lit windows, becomes visible behind the trees. A small, white circular reticle, an overlay element, is present in the center of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a wide shot, positioning a man in a dark coat carrying a suitcase in the center of the frame, walking within the middle ground. A wooden fence lines the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while bare trees occupy the middle ground and background. A streetlamp stands in the left background. As the man walks toward the right, the camera, positioned at his level, pans to the right. This movement causes the man to shift to the left side of the frame before exiting it completely. The pan concludes by revealing a large, multi-story green house in the left-center background, situated behind the trees and fence. A small, white circular reticle, an overlay on the screen, remains fixed in the center of the shot throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
