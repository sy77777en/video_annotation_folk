  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot filmed from a high angle, a pair of light-skinned, puppet-like hands is initially positioned in the top center foreground, reaching down toward a small, gold-colored clock resting on a piece of red, textured cloth in the center foreground. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals, black hands, and a cracked glass cover, with the letters \"BIJ\" and the word \"QUARTZ\" visible on the dial. The camera captures this scene from a high, slightly unsteady static angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the hands as they wrap the clock. In the out-of-focus background, a framed photograph of several people is positioned in the top left, with other cluttered items, including a piece of green and gold fabric, visible on the right. A second hand, initially out of view and positioned behind the red cloth, remains in the center of the frame. Together, the hands carefully fold the cloth's corners over the clock, creating a small, square bundle, which they hold in their palms. Throughout most of the video, the hands maintain the same height, with the drawer remaining below them. Towards the end of the video, the depth of field shifts as the hands place the wrapped clock back into the drawer, making the contents of the drawer more visible while maintaining focus on the hands and the clock. The hands finish by pushing the red bundle into the drawer, which was visible in the background at the start.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a high, slightly unsteady static angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the hands in the foreground as they wrap a broken clock in a red cloth. Towards the end of the video, the depth of field shifts as the hands place the wrapped clock back into the drawer, making the contents of the drawer more visible while maintaining focus on the hands and the clock.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands, resembling those of a puppet, carefully wraps a small, round, gold-colored clock in a piece of red, textured cloth. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals, black hands, and a cracked glass cover; the letters \"BIJ\" and the word \"QUARTZ\" are visible on the dial. The hands fold the red cloth around the clock, creating a small bundle. In the blurred background, a framed photograph of several people and items of clothing are visible, seemingly located in a drawer.",
    "Motion": "A pair of puppet-like hands holds a small, gold-colored clock resting on a piece of red cloth. The hands then carefully fold the cloth's corners over the clock, creating a small, square bundle, which they hold in their palms. At the end of the video, the hands place the bundled clock into a drawer that was visible in the background at the start, with the drawer remaining below the hands throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "Above a dark, cluttered drawer, a pair of hands carefully wraps a small, gold-colored clock in a piece of worn red cloth. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals and a cracked glass cover. In the background, a blurry, framed family photograph rests among other indistinct items, including a piece of green and gold fabric. The hands finish by pushing the red bundle into the drawer.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot filmed from a high angle, a hand is initially positioned in the top center foreground, reaching down toward a small gold clock resting on a red cloth in the center foreground. In the out-of-focus background, a framed photograph is positioned in the top left, with other cluttered items visible on the right. A second hand, initially out of view and positioned behind the red cloth, remains in the center of the frame. Together, the hands fold the cloth around the clock, maintaining the same height throughout most of the video before placing the red bundle into a drawer towards the end."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
