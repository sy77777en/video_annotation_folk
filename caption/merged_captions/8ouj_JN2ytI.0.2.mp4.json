  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man with dark, styled-back hair and an olive complexion in the left foreground, shown in profile as he looks intently toward the right. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt, with a gold chain or zipper pull visible at his neck. Positioned behind him in the middle ground are several other people, including another man immediately behind him and a woman further back, all on the left side of the frame and looking in the same direction, though they are out of focus. The right side of the frame is occupied by a large window, through which a bright, blurry outdoor scene is visible in the background, suggesting a large venue with a distant crowd. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground, while very gradually zooming in towards the center of the frame. The man in the foreground remains largely still, exhibiting only slight movements of his head, while the other people standing behind him remain completely still, all looking intently in the same direction. The scene is set within a dimly lit interior, with the window separating the dark interior from the brighter exterior. Several figures are positioned in near-silhouette, gazing through the glass.",

    "Scene": "From within a dimly lit interior, a large window looks out onto a bright, blurry outdoor setting.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
