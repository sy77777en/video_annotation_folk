  "merged_caption": "The video captures a close-up view of a cluttered kitchen counter, filmed from the subjects' level at a hip-level height with a level angle. A black coffee maker is positioned in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground, with a black dish rack to its right. In the background, a window spans the top center and right of the frame, with several small bottles resting on its sill in the top-right. The foreground is filled with various items: a slice of bread is in the bottom left-center, while a sliced orange bell pepper and a plastic bag are in the bottom right-center. The scene is dimly lit, characterized by soft, natural light filtering through the window, highlighting dust particles in the air. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, early morning or late afternoon, with a sense of stillness and neglect. The camera remains completely static throughout, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the background. The scene remains static until an egg is thrown from off-screen, striking and splattering across the left pane of the window in the background, leaving a splattered egg mark on the glass, but the window remains intact without any cracks appearing. The overall setting conveys a sense of everyday kitchen activity with items left out in a casual, unarranged manner, emphasizing the untidy and lived-in nature of the space.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts a dimly lit kitchen setting, characterized by a cluttered countertop with various items such as a coffee maker, a sliced bell pepper, and scattered food remnants. A small window above the counter allows soft, natural light to filter in, highlighting dust particles in the air. The window sill holds several small containers, possibly spice jars or medicine bottles. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, early morning or late afternoon, with a sense of stillness and neglect.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
