  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is framed by the photographer's arms and a black camera, which occupy the foreground on the left, right, and top center of the frame. The camera is held at eye level, positioned above a body of calm, turquoise water that fills the lower half of the scene. The shot is fixed and slightly unsteady, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, with deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp and clear. In the middle ground, a series of weathered wooden posts emerge from the water; one post is positioned directly in the center of the frame with a small white and grey seagull perched on top. Other posts are visible to the left and receding into the background, where they are obscured by thick, white fog. A modern post with a square concrete base and a metal pole is located in the right middle ground near the edge of a walkway. The scene is mostly static, with minimal movement as the person holding the camera, wearing a brown leather jacket, raises it slightly. The water remains calm with gentle ripples, and the seagull stays perched on the central post. The overall scene is cast in a muted, grey light, with the fog causing more distant posts to appear as faint silhouettes.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the photographer's hands in the foreground to the distant posts in the foggy background, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin, wearing a brown leather jacket, holds a black camera with both hands. The camera is aimed at a body of calm, turquoise water, out of which several weathered wooden posts emerge vertically. A small white and grey seagull is perched on top of the most prominent central post. The scene is enveloped in a thick, white fog, causing more distant posts to appear as faint silhouettes. On the right, a modern post with a square concrete base and a metal pole stands near the edge of a walkway.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a person in a brown leather jacket holding a black camera, pointed towards a body of murky turquoise water on a foggy day. Several weathered wooden posts emerge from the water, with a single white and grey bird perched on the one in the center. The thick fog obscures the background, where more posts are faintly visible. To the right, a modern post with a concrete base stands at the water's edge. The water has gentle ripples, and the overall scene is cast in a muted, grey light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
