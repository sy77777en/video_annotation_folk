  "merged_caption": "In a low-angle, fisheye full shot, a man with brown skin and a beard is positioned in the center foreground, squatting down. He wears a blue, knitted balaclava that covers the top of his head, a white t-shirt, and blue jeans. His hands are held even closer to the camera, forming a triangle shape with his index fingers and thumbs to frame and stretch his mouth into a wide, exaggerated smile. The background consists of an indoor staircase, with a wood-paneled wall and a colorful piece of framed art with bright purple and green hues in the left middle ground, and a dark wooden handrail curving along the right middle ground. An overhead light is visible in the top center background. The camera is positioned below the subject's eye level at hip level and remains static, capturing the scene in fast-motion, slightly faster than real-time, with a fisheye lens that creates noticeable distortion. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field. The man playfully moves his tongue in and out, adding a humorous touch, while the camera remains static. The scene is lit by a single, warm overhead light, enhancing the warm-toned wood paneling on the walls.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion video, playing slightly faster than real-time, is captured from a static, slightly unsteady low-angle shot at hip level. A fisheye lens creates noticeable distortion, and the entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A man with brown skin and a beard is shown from a low, close-up, fisheye perspective. He wears a blue, knitted balaclava that covers the top of his head, a white t-shirt, and blue jeans. While squatting and looking directly into the camera, he forms a triangle shape with his hands, using his index fingers and thumbs to frame and stretch his mouth into a wide, exaggerated smile.",
    "Motion": "The man squats and looks directly into the camera, forming a triangle shape with his hands using his index fingers and thumbs to frame and stretch his mouth into a wide, exaggerated smile. He playfully moves his tongue in and out, adding a humorous touch, while the camera remains static.",
    "Scene": "This low-angle shot, captured with a fisheye lens, presents a distorted, circular view of an indoor staircase. The walls are lined with vertical, warm-toned wood paneling. On the left, a colorful piece of framed art with bright purple and green hues is visible. A dark wooden handrail curves along the right side of the frame. The scene is lit by a single, warm overhead light. A person wearing a blue knitted balaclava, a white shirt, and jeans crouches in the center of the composition.",
    "Spatial": "In a low-angle, fisheye full shot, a man is positioned in the center foreground, squatting down. His hands are held even closer to the camera, forming a triangle shape that frames his mouth. The background consists of an indoor staircase, with a wood-paneled wall and a colorful painting in the left middle ground, and a dark handrail curving along the right middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
