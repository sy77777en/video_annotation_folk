  "merged_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot against a plain white background, featuring a small, black-and-white, cartoon-like figure with a trapezoidal head, one dot-like eye visible in profile, and a small, pointed, black-and-white hat. This figure is seated on a simple, black, curved sled adorned with small, distinct orange, green, and blue dots at its back. Initially, the figure is seen in the center-right of the frame, moving along a short curved line. The camera smoothly trucks right, following the side-view game avatar, then moves upward and subsequently downward, mirroring the avatar's parabolic trajectory as it propels upwards to the right before sliding downwards to the right along a thick, black, curved line. As the line disappears, a series of black, angular, geometric shapes appear sequentially, typically materializing from the sides of the frame and near the figure as it slides. The figure performs a backward roll, followed by a forward roll, and then alternates between these rolls as it navigates from right to left, then left to right, and back to right to left again. The 2D position of the figure within the frame dynamically shifts, predominantly occupying the right and central areas. The path for this figure is represented by a thick, black, curved line that later transforms into various angular, geometric shapes composed of black lines. The camera maintains a side-view perspective, positioned level with the character's plane of movement, capturing the minimalist environment with a plain white background. The scene evolves as the character progresses across the white void, with the dynamically changing black line forming various paths, including curves and angular polygonal shapes, appearing and disappearing as the character moves.",

    "Motion": "A small, black-and-white cartoon figure on a sled first propels upwards to the right before sliding downwards to the right along a thick, black, curved line. The line then disappears, and a series of black, angular, geometric shapes appear sequentially. As the figure moves and collides with these shapes, it performs a backward roll, followed by a forward roll, and then alternates between these rolls as it navigates from right to left, then left to right, and back to right to left again.",
    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a minimalist environment with a plain white background. A small, black-and-white character on a sled, which has tiny orange, green, and blue dots, moves along a dynamically changing black line. This line forms various paths, including curves and angular polygonal shapes, appearing and disappearing as the character progresses across the white void.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot against a plain white background. A small, black-and-white cartoon figure on a sled is initially seen in the center-right of the frame, moving along a short curved line. Various black, angular geometric line shapes materialize and dematerialize sequentially, typically appearing from the sides of the frame and near the figure as it slides. The figure's 2D position within the frame dynamically shifts, predominantly occupying the right and central areas.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
