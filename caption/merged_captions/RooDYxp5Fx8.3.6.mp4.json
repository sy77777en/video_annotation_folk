  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a Japanese street corner under a bright blue sky with large, white, puffy clouds. Initially, a red taxi is in the center middle ground, driving from right to left on a paved two-way road that occupies the lower half of the frame. A dark pole stands in the left foreground. In the background, a green hedge lines the road, with a mix of traditional Japanese-style structures and modern apartment buildings and trees behind it. The camera, positioned at eye level, first pans left with smooth camera work to follow the red taxi as it moves to the left side of the frame, bringing a black sedan and a white car into view in the middle ground, trailing behind the taxi. The street is lined with a manicured green hedge, which partially obstructs the view of oncoming vehicles. Behind the hedge stands a one-story restaurant with a green tiled roof and modern, multi-story grey and white structures. The camera then tilts upward, causing the street to move to the bottom of the frame and bringing a large blue overhead road sign into the center. This sign provides directions in both Japanese and English for destinations such as Otsu, Yamashinahigashino, and Shimogamo, along with route numbers. The final shot frames the sign in the upper half, with the tops of the background buildings below it and a cloudy blue sky filling the top. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the traffic and the sign, in sharp detail. The focus of the shot is on the overall urban environment and the sense of place, rather than on any single vehicle or building, emphasizing the location and atmosphere of this specific intersection.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
