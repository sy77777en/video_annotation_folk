  "merged_caption": "In a static medium shot, a middle-aged white man with short, brown, receding hair and a trimmed brown and gray beard stands in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the frame. He is wearing a very light blue, almost white, long-sleeved, button-down shirt and dark trousers, with a red lanyard and clear ID badge around his neck. A watch is visible on his left wrist, and a thin black wire for a microphone is clipped to his shirt collar. The man stands while speaking and gesturing with his hands, holding a small black presentation remote in his right hand. To his left, a large white projection screen occupies the right side of the frame. Behind him, a wooden lectern is visible on the left side of the frame in the background, positioned in front of a deep red wall. The lighting is even and consistent with an indoor environment. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, begins with a slightly unsteady eye-level, level-angle shot, panning left and tilting up to center the lecturer. It then zooms in on him before remaining static for the rest of the clip. The man remains in a fixed position while his upper body sways slightly as he presents, using both hands to emphasize his words.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus. The camera, which is slightly unsteady, begins by panning left and tilting up to center the lecturer. It then zooms in on him before remaining static for the rest of the clip.",
    "Subject": "A middle-aged white man with short, brown, receding hair and a trimmed brown and gray beard is shown from the waist up. He is wearing a very light blue, almost white, long-sleeved, button-down shirt and dark trousers. Around his neck, he wears a red lanyard with a clear ID badge. A watch is visible on his left wrist, and a thin black wire for a microphone is clipped to his shirt collar. He stands while speaking and gesturing with his hands, holding a small black object, likely a presentation remote.",

    "Scene": "This is an indoor shot of a presentation room. A man wearing a light-colored shirt and a red lanyard stands center-left, in front of a deep red wall. Behind him on the left side of the frame is a light-colored wooden lectern. To his left, on the right side of the frame, is a large, white projection screen that takes up a significant portion of the view. The lighting is even and consistent with an indoor environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
