  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot with four men positioned across different depths outdoors on a paved area under a bright sky with a dense backdrop of green trees. In the foreground, on the left, a man with dark curly hair and a full dark beard, wearing a light grey t-shirt and black shorts, initially holds a red water balloon. To his right, in the center-left middle ground, a man with short brown hair and glasses, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts with a small logo, holds a blue water balloon. In the center middle ground, a third man with dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a dark graphic print and dark green shorts, holds an orange water balloon. On the far right foreground, a fourth man wearing a red baseball cap backward, a blue t-shirt with a graphic, and dark shorts, holds a knife, facing the others. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing the scene from a low angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground subjects. The video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning from regular speed to slow motion. The camera smoothly pans right while slightly tilting upward. The man on the left throws the red balloon horizontally from left to right towards the man on the right. Concurrently, the men in the center-left and center throw their blue and orange balloons upwards; these balloons ascend from their respective positions towards the top of the frame. Midway, the camera motion abruptly slows as the video speed decreases, creating a frozen-in-time effect. The man on the right intercepts the incoming red balloon with the knife, causing it to burst and spray water in the center foreground. A paved area occupies the bottom middle ground, with dense green trees forming the background.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning from regular speed to slow motion. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing the scene from a low angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus maintained on the foreground subjects. Throughout the video, the camera smoothly pans right while slightly tilting upward. Midway, this motion abruptly slows as the video speed decreases, creating a frozen-in-time effect.",
    "Subject": "The video features four men outdoors. The leftmost man, with dark curly hair and a full dark beard, is wearing a light grey t-shirt and black shorts. He initially holds a red water balloon, which he throws. To his right, a man with short brown hair and glasses, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts with a small logo, throws a blue water balloon. In the middle, a man with dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a dark graphic print and dark green shorts, throws an orange water balloon into the air. On the far right, a man wearing a red baseball cap backward, a blue t-shirt with a graphic, and dark shorts, holds a knife with both hands and pops the red water balloon thrown by the leftmost man, causing water to spray.",
    "Motion": "Four men are outdoors. The leftmost man throws a red water balloon towards the rightmost man. Simultaneously, the man to his right throws a blue water balloon upwards, and the man in the middle throws an orange water balloon upwards. The rightmost man, holding a knife, swings it and pops the incoming red water balloon, causing water to spray. The blue and orange water balloons continue to ascend.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a paved area, under a bright sky with a dense backdrop of green trees. Four men are present. Colorful water balloons—red, blue, and orange—are visible. One man, holding a knife, is positioned to interact with a red water balloon that is thrown towards him. Other balloons are tossed into the air, and the red balloon bursts, creating a visible splash of water.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium full shot with four men positioned across different depths. In the foreground, on the left, a man initially holds a red water balloon. To his right, in the center-left middle ground, a second man holds a blue water balloon. In the center middle ground, a third man holds an orange water balloon. On the far right foreground, a fourth man holds a knife, facing the others. The man on the left throws the red balloon horizontally from left to right towards the man on the right. Concurrently, the men in the center-left and center throw their blue and orange balloons upwards; these balloons ascend from their respective positions towards the top of the frame. The man on the right intercepts the incoming red balloon with the knife, causing it to burst and spray water in the center foreground. A paved area occupies the bottom middle ground, with dense green trees forming the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
