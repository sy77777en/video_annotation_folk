  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a rifle with a holographic sight occupies the bottom foreground. In the middle ground, another soldier, identified by on-screen text as Captain Price, is positioned in the center-left, cutting a chain on a wire mesh gate that extends across the frame. The scene is viewed through a green-tinted night vision display, overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD) that includes a vertical scale on the left, an ammunition count on the bottom right, and markings in the center to assist with aiming. White text subtitles appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue. The ally's name, \"Prince,\" is displayed in green, while the enemy's name, \"AI-Qatala Fighter 4,\" appears in red. After cutting the chain, Captain Price pushes the gate open to the left and moves forward. The camera follows, advancing through the gate into an overgrown, grassy area with a simple building to the left and trees in the background. The soldier is positioned in the center-left, while a building appears on the left. In the middle-to-background area on the left, several other figures, identified as Al-Qatala fighters, become visible near the building and a vehicle. The camera executes complex, slightly unsteady movements that mirror the character's actions, initially maintaining a level angle before tilting downward into a high angle to observe the scene. As the character moves forward, the camera angle returns to a level position. The camera continues to move forward and pans slightly left, initially keeping the lead soldier in the center of the frame before they move to the right while observing the distant figures. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire environment in sharp detail.",

    "Camera": "This first-person video is shot from an eye-level perspective, simulating a character's viewpoint in a video game. The camera executes complex, slightly unsteady movements that mirror the character's actions, initially maintaining a level angle before tilting downward into a high angle to observe the scene.

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision scope, a soldier holds a rifle equipped with a holographic sight. In front of them, another soldier, identified by on-screen text as Captain Price, wears a helmet, a tactical vest, and a backpack with a rifle attached. Captain Price uses bolt cutters to break a chain on a wire mesh gate and then pushes it open. After moving through the gate, they cautiously advance into a grassy area where several other armed figures, identified as Al-Qatala fighters, are seen in the distance near a building and a vehicle.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person viewpoint, a soldier identified as Captain Price uses bolt cutters to sever a chain on a wire mesh gate. After breaking the lock, he pushes the gate open. The player follows Price as he moves through the opening and cautiously advances through a grassy area. They then stop as several other armed figures are seen moving in the distance near a building.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a nighttime scene through a green-tinted night vision display. The view is initially focused on another soldier in tactical gear who is using bolt cutters to break a chain on a tall, wire-mesh gate. After the gate is opened, the characters move forward into an overgrown, grassy area with a simple building to the left and trees in the background. The scene is overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD) that includes a vertical scale on the left, an ammunition count on the bottom right, and markings in the center to assist with aiming. White text subtitles appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue. The ally's name, \"Prince,\" is displayed in green, while the enemy's name, \"AI-Qatala Fighter 4,\" appears in red.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
