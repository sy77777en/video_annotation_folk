  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, showing a person dressed in a dark, loose-fitting garment partially concealed among tall grass positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, while the grass itself dominates the foreground across the lower and middle portions of the frame. The environment is a windswept, open landscape dominated by tall, dry grasses and rolling sand dunes under a sky filled with scattered clouds, rendered in black and white for a monochromatic appearance. The camera starts at ground level with a level angle, using deep focus. Initially static, the handheld camera moves forward across the grass, revealing a vast expanse of open sand dunes in the distance, where the person is now seen as a small silhouette near the center-bottom of the frame in the distant background. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, creating the impression of a higher elevation. The shot transitions to an extreme wide landscape view, with many of the tall grasses receding from the foreground, though some remain visible to enhance the depth of the scene. The person, appearing small in scale against the vast expanse of rolling sand dunes with sparse vegetation, emphasizes the scale of the natural surroundings. The camera then halts and slowly pans right, transitioning to a high angle by the end. The sand dunes and sparse vegetation fill the middle and background, emphasizing the scale of the environment. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a low, ground-level perspective, first at the height of the grass and person, then slightly above the terrain as it reveals the broader landscape. The black-and-white presentation emphasizes the contrast between the figure and the landscape, highlighting the person’s isolation and the openness of the environment.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at ground level with a level angle, using deep focus. Initially static, the handheld camera moves forward across the grass to reveal the valley, creating the impression of a higher elevation. It then halts and slowly pans right, transitioning to a high angle by the end. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person dressed in a dark, loose-fitting garment, partially concealed among tall grass, walking away with their back to the camera. As the view shifts, we peer through the grass at a lone figure, likely the same person, appearing in the distance, small in scale against a vast expanse of rolling sand dunes with sparse vegetation. The black-and-white presentation emphasizes the contrast between the figure and the landscape, highlighting the person’s isolation and the openness of the environment.",
    "Motion": "The person walks away from the camera through tall grass and eventually moves out of the frame. As the camera moves forward, it reveals a vast expanse of open sand dunes in the distance, where a person is standing.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a windswept, open landscape dominated by tall, dry grasses and rolling sand dunes under a sky filled with scattered clouds. The environment is rendered in black and white, giving the scene a monochromatic appearance. The grasses in the foreground are thin, upright, and textured, with some bending in the wind, while the dunes in the background have smooth, undulating shapes with visible ridges and patches of vegetation. The lighting suggests daytime, with sunlight casting soft shadows across the terrain. A solitary figure is present, partially obscured by the grasses and later seen as a small silhouette traversing the expansive sandy area, emphasizing the scale of the natural surroundings. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, showing a person partially concealed among tall grass positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, while the grass itself dominates the foreground across the lower and middle portions of the frame. In the background, rolling sand dunes and a cloudy sky stretch across the upper part of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the person, level with the grass. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions to an extreme wide landscape view, with many of the tall grasses receding from the foreground, though some remain visible to enhance the depth of the scene. The person now appears as a small figure near the center-bottom of the frame in the distant background. The sand dunes and sparse vegetation fill the middle and background, emphasizing the scale of the environment. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a low, ground-level perspective, first at the height of the grass and person, then slightly above the terrain as it reveals the broader landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
