  "merged_caption": "This wide, eye-level shot initially frames two men in dark blue suits and white shirts in the center middle ground, standing between a glass food display case on the left and a red Coca-Cola vending machine on the right, with an orange bicycle positioned in the bottom-left middle ground. The scene takes place on a daytime street in Japan, featuring a storefront with a wooden facade and a large glass display case filled with realistic models of Japanese food, such as ramen and donburi bowls, arranged on illuminated shelves. The camera, exhibiting minimal shaking, begins with a slight downward tilt before panning left, mainly due to aimless shaking, as pedestrians walk past the vending machine. A man in a dark grey long-sleeve shirt holding a cellphone walks past from right to left in the right foreground, passing the camera. The two men in suits then turn and walk out of the frame to the right. Subsequently, other pedestrians, including a man in a black long-sleeve shirt with a pink design on the back, a man in a white t-shirt, and two women with long, wavy, light brown hair—one in a white collared shirt and the other in a light brown jacket—enter from the right and walk across the foreground toward the left, passing in front of the stationary vending machines and bicycle. All pedestrians are wearing face masks. Adjacent to the shop stands a smaller, dark-colored vending machine displaying rows of small, colorful items with Japanese text related to blood types and an Egyptian pharaoh graphic. The camera shortly pauses before a subtle forward movement concludes the shot, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera, exhibiting minimal shaking, begins with a slight downward tilt before panning left, mainly due to aimless shaking, as pedestrians walk past a vending machine. It then shortly pauses before a subtle forward movement concludes the shot.",
    "Subject": "Several pedestrians, all wearing face masks, are observed. Two men in dark blue suits and white shirts are initially seen from the back, standing by a tall red beverage vending machine before walking away. A man in a dark grey long-sleeve shirt walks by holding a cellphone. A man in a black long-sleeved shirt with a pink design on the back walks past. Another man, wearing a white t-shirt, also walks by. A woman with long, wavy, light brown hair and a white collared shirt is seen walking past, mostly from her side and back, accompanied by another woman with long, wavy, lighter brown hair and a light brown jacket. Stationary objects in the scene include an orange bicycle with a brown seat and a front basket, a glass-fronted display case with food models, the red beverage vending machine, and a smaller, dark-colored vending machine displaying rows of small, colorful items.",
    "Motion": "Two men in dark blue suits stand in front of a red vending machine before turning and walking to the right. As they move, a person in a black long-sleeve shirt, holding a cellphone, walks past from right to left. Subsequently, two other people walk from right to left, and two women with long hair enter the frame from the right, moving left.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on a daytime street in Japan, featuring a storefront with a wooden facade and a large glass display case. Inside the case, numerous realistic models of Japanese food, such as ramen and donburi bowls, are arranged on illuminated shelves. Adjacent to the shop stands a bright red Coca-Cola vending machine filled with various soft drinks. Between the storefront and the vending machines, an orange bicycle with a brown seat and a front basket is parked, alongside a smaller black stand displaying a grid of colorful items with Japanese text related to blood types and an Egyptian pharaoh graphic. Pedestrians, including some in dark uniforms and others in casual clothes, walk through the scene, all wearing face masks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
