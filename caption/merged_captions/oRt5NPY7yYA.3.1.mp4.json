  "merged_caption": "A military convoy is prominently featured, stretching from the bottom left foreground to the center middle ground on a desert highway. The main semi-truck, with a dark cab and a long, white, windowless trailer adorned with large white patterns, occupies the center of the frame, escorted by several identical green, armored military vehicles with turrets or equipment mounted on their roofs. These vehicles are positioned both in front of and behind the semi-truck, while a dark-colored SUV follows at the very rear. The video, filmed by a drone, starts with a high, oblique downward angle, smoothly tracking the convoy as it drives in formation along the long, straight, two-way, four-lane highway that bisects a vast desert landscape. The arid environment is characterized by sandy, beige-colored terrain with sparse, low-lying vegetation, and in the distance, low, rocky hills line the horizon under a bright, slightly hazy sky. The camera moves backward, descends, and pans from right to left, transitioning to an eye-level perspective, while the convoy moves forward at a consistent speed. The camera keeps the vehicles centered in the frame as they travel into the distance along the dark gray asphalt road, marked with yellow center lines. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a lower angle, offering a closer view of the vehicles. In the background, distant rock formations and a cloud-filled sky enhance the scene's depth, adding to the dramatic landscape. While the convoy remains in focus, the surrounding desert landscape appears slightly blurred due to motion, emphasizing the dynamic movement of the convoy through the expansive desert setting.",

    "Subject": "A military-style convoy is shown traveling down a long, straight, four-lane highway in a desert environment. The main focus of the convoy is a large semi-truck with a dark cab and a long, white, windowless trailer that has large white patterns on its side. This central truck is escorted by several identical green, armored military vehicles, which are positioned both in front of and behind it. These escort vehicles are square in shape and appear to have turrets or equipment mounted on their roofs. Following at the very rear of the convoy is a dark-colored SUV.",
    "Motion": "An aerial view tracks a military convoy as it drives in formation along a straight desert highway. The entire convoy moves forward at a consistent speed. The central semi-truck is flanked by several green armored vehicles, which maintain their positions in front of and behind it. A dark SUV trails at the very rear of the procession. The camera moves parallel to the convoy, keeping the vehicles centered in the frame as they travel into the distance.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a convoy of vehicles traveling down a long, straight, two-way, four-lane highway that bisects a vast desert landscape. The arid environment is characterized by sandy, beige-colored terrain with sparse, low-lying vegetation. In the distance, low, rocky hills line the horizon under a bright, slightly hazy sky. The convoy, consisting of several olive-green armored vehicles and a large semi-truck with a white trailer, proceeds along the dark gray asphalt road, which is marked with yellow center lines.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
