  "merged_caption": "The video is a medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level, exhibiting mild barrel distortion and filmed from an eye-level, level angle. Initially, the main subject, a light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair, a short beard, and tattoos on his left forearm, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey with a large green \"tld\" logo and matching yellow shorts, occupies the center-left foreground, facing slightly towards the left side of the frame. He has a pair of red, white, and blue goggles with text, worn backward around his neck. To his immediate right in the foreground is another man in a white t-shirt with a black graphic, light-colored shorts, a black baseball cap worn backward, and a gray wrist brace, smiling towards the main subject. The middle ground, extending from the center to the right, contains several other individuals, with red rock formations and a distant hillside populated with more people forming the background. The main subject then takes a couple of steps forward and to his right, continuing to turn his body in that direction, and briefly touches his left hip, shifting slightly towards the center-right of the foreground. Subsequently, a light-skinned woman with blonde hair, wearing a bright blue zip-up jacket over a black top and a white knit beanie, and another man enter the frame from the left, positioning themselves in the left middle ground as they interact with the main subject. The woman gestures with her left hand while speaking. Sparse bushes and dusty, light brown earth are visible across the foreground and middle ground. The camera pans left with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the yellow and green jersey in focus. The sky above is partly cloudy, revealing patches of blue.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. Filmed from an eye-level, level angle, the camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the yellow and green jersey in the foreground in focus. The camera pans left with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair, a short beard, and tattoos on his left forearm, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey with a large green \"tld\" logo and matching yellow shorts; he also has a pair of red, white, and blue goggles with text, worn backward around his neck. He is interacting with several other people. To his left, a light-skinned man with sunglasses wears a white t-shirt with a black graphic, light-colored shorts, a black baseball cap worn backward, and a gray wrist brace, smiling towards the main subject. A light-skinned woman with blonde hair, wearing a bright blue zip-up jacket over a black top and a white knit beanie, appears to be speaking and gesturing towards the main subject. Nearby, a light-skinned man in a black t-shirt, a black baseball cap, and a black backpack looks on. Further in the mid-ground, other individuals include a man in a green long-sleeved shirt and a yellow cap, possibly holding a camera, and another man in a bright green long-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. Many other people are visible in the distant background on a hillside.",
    "Motion": "The man in the yellow and green jersey initially stands facing slightly to his right. He takes a couple of steps forward and to his right, continuing to turn his body in that direction, and briefly touches his left hip. He then faces a woman in a blue jacket, gesturing with his left hand as he looks at her. The man in the white t-shirt to his right remains relatively still, smiling towards him. The woman in the blue jacket gestures with her left hand while speaking. Other people in the mid-ground and background are mostly standing or walking slowly.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in an arid, rocky landscape during the daytime, characterized by prominent red rock formations and hills in the background, upon which distant figures can be seen. The foreground and mid-ground consist of dusty, light brown earth interspersed with sparse, low-lying green and brown bushes. Several people, dressed in casual outdoor or athletic clothing, are present. A man in a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey is noticeable as he turns and interacts with a woman in a blue jacket and a white beanie. Other individuals are visible further back, standing or moving slightly. The sky above is partly cloudy, revealing patches of blue.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
