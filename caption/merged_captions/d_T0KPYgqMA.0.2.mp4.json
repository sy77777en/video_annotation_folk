  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a woman in a courtroom, capturing her from the chest up. Positioned in the foreground and slightly off-center to the right, she dominates the scene. Her 2D position is central-right, while in 3D space, she is in the foreground, clearly the focal point. The woman is wearing a traditional barrister's wig and black robe with white bands, suggesting she is addressing the court. Behind her, in the middle ground, several individuals are seated, forming a background audience. These figures occupy the upper-left portion of the frame, with their 2D positions spread across the left side. Their 3D placement is further back compared to the main subject. The background figures include a man in a suit and glasses, a woman with long hair, and another with blonde hair, all seated and facing forward. The camera remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent shot size and angle, with a shallow depth of field focused on the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, emphasizing her prominence in the scene. The woman remains stationary, maintaining a focused posture as she speaks, while the seated audience members remain still, suggesting their role as observers in the courtroom setting. The video is set indoors in a courtroom, characterized by wooden paneling and a formal atmosphere, emphasizing the solemnity and focus of the proceedings. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled lighting typical of indoor settings. The overall environment reflects a formal legal proceeding, with the primary subject actively engaged in delivering her address. There are no noticeable changes in the spatial arrangement or camera movement between the beginning and end of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
