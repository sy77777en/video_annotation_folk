  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle, the scene begins with the back of a woman's head in the foreground, obscuring a man behind her. The man, with clown-like makeup, has white face paint, dark, smudged makeup around his eyes, a smeared red smile extending into scars on his cheeks, greasy, shoulder-length green hair, and wears a purple suit jacket with black leather gloves. The woman has brown hair styled in an updo and wears a dark top. The camera, using a shallow depth of field, performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around the two subjects, who are facing each other. As the camera moves to their side, the man maintains eye contact with the woman and raises a small knife to her cheek. The camera continues to circle them, revealing the man on the right side of the frame, holding the woman, who is positioned on the left. As the rotation progresses, the man's back moves to the center-foreground, temporarily blocking the woman from view. The shot concludes with the camera positioned over the man's right shoulder, framing the woman's face on the right side of the screen. Throughout this movement, out-of-focus guests and a table set with a white tablecloth and a floral centerpiece are visible in the middle ground, with a dark city skyline and distant lights in the far background. The scene takes place indoors at night, within a dimly lit room during what appears to be a formal gathering, with overall low lighting casting the environment in shadow.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from an eye-level, level angle, this shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the two characters in the foreground. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around them.",
    "Subject": "In a medium close-up shot that circles two individuals, a man with clown-like makeup holds a woman. The man has white face paint, dark, smudged makeup around his eyes, a smeared red smile that extends into scars on his cheeks, greasy, shoulder-length green hair, and is wearing a purple suit jacket with black leather gloves. The woman has brown hair styled in an updo and wears a dark top. The video begins with the back of the woman's head obscuring the man. As the camera moves, it reveals the man holding a small knife to the woman's cheek. The camera continues to rotate, showing the man's back to the camera and then settling on a view of the woman's face over his shoulder.",
    "Motion": "The camera circles around a man and a woman who are facing each other. As the camera moves to their side, the man maintains eye contact with the woman and raises a small knife to her cheek. The camera continues to rotate around them, eventually showing the back of the man's head as he holds the woman, whose face is visible over his shoulder.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors at night, within a dimly lit room during what appears to be a formal gathering. Large windows reveal a dark city skyline with distant lights visible behind them. Other guests are visible behind them, and a table is set with a white tablecloth and a floral centerpiece. The overall lighting is low, casting the environment in shadow.",
    "Spatial": "The shot begins as a medium close-up, with the back of a woman's head in the foreground, obscuring a man behind her. The camera then circles the two subjects from left to right. As it moves, the man is revealed on the right side of the frame, holding the woman, who is positioned on the left. The camera continues its rotation, causing the man's back to move to the center-foreground and temporarily block the woman from view. The shot concludes with the camera positioned over the man's right shoulder, framing the woman's face on the right side of the screen. Throughout this movement, out-of-focus guests and a table are visible in the middle ground, with a dark city skyline in the far background. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
