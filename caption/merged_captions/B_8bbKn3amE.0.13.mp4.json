  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot capturing a passenger boat from above and behind, placing the boat in the middle ground of the frame. The boat occupies a small portion of the frame, emphasizing the expansive river and surrounding landscape. The camera, shot with a smooth drone, is positioned high above the boat, offering a broad view of the river's width and the lush greenery on either side. The scene unfolds during the day under a clear sky with minimal clouds, with sunlight reflecting off the water's surface. As the video progresses, the camera moves in a counter-clockwise arc around the boat, gradually descending in altitude. This transition shifts the perspective from an aerial view to a more direct frontal angle. The camera tilts upward, transitioning to a level angle at the front of the boat, which grows larger in the frame. By the end of the video, the shot size changes to a wide shot, with the camera now at the boat's level, focusing on the bow where a person is seated, wearing a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The boat moves closer to the center of the frame, with the surrounding river and banks remaining visible in the background, maintaining the natural setting. The river is flanked by lush green forests and a rocky, sandy bank on both sides, creating a natural and tranquil environment. The surrounding landscape features distant hills and a gentle flow of the river, emphasizing the vastness and calmness of the area. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a smooth movement, transitioning from an elevated position above the boat to a level position alongside it, enhancing the viewer's engagement with the scene.",

    "Camera": "This video, shot with a smooth drone camera, exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera starts at an aerial level with a varying Dutch angle as it rolls, using deep focus to keep most of the scene sharp. However, some parts appear slightly out of focus due to the fast movements of both the camera and the boat. The camera tracks a boat moving forward on a wide river, beginning from a high angle behind and above. It flies forward, descending while arcing counter-clockwise around the boat. As it arcs, the camera tilts upward, transitioning to a level angle at the front of the boat, which grows larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, it is captured in an extreme wide shot from above and behind, highlighting the boat's position on the river. As the camera arcs around and descends, the focus shifts to a wide shot from the front, revealing the boat's bow. Seated at the bow is a person dressed in a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The river is flanked by lush greenery and a sandy bank, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, the boat is seen from above and behind, moving steadily along the river. The camera then arcs around and descends to capture a wide shot from the front, focusing on the boat's bow. A person is seated at the bow, wearing a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The river is bordered by lush greenery and a sandy bank, creating a natural backdrop.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a serene outdoor setting along a wide river. The scene unfolds during the day under a clear sky with minimal clouds, with sunlight reflecting off the water's surface. The river is flanked by lush green forests and a rocky, sandy bank on both sides, creating a natural and tranquil environment. A long, narrow boat navigates the river, adding a sense of motion and exploration to the scene. The surrounding landscape features distant hills and a gentle flow of the river, emphasizing the vastness and calmness of the area. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the river's path and the encompassing natural beauty.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
