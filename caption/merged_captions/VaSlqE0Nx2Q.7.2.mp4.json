  "merged_caption": "This wide shot opens on a black-and-white forest scene with tall, slender pine trees standing in rows and a large fallen tree with tangled branches in the left middle ground. A young boy with light skin, dressed in early 20th-century attire consisting of a dark, single-breasted jacket, dark knickerbockers, light-colored knee-high socks, dark boots, and a dark flat cap, appears in the right middle ground. He initially runs towards the right, moving forward before turning to the right as he navigates through the wooded area. The camera, positioned at hip-level, captures him from the side and then transitions to a front view, moving to the right and slightly backward to follow his path, causing him to grow larger in the frame. The boy slows down, settling into a steady walk over the grassy, uneven ground, following a path alongside a thin white string tied between the trees. The camera pans slightly to keep him in view, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire forest scene sharp. As the boy walks towards the right foreground, more trees with thin white strings attached to them enter the frame from the right foreground. The camera continues to move backward, ensuring the boy remains in view as he navigates through the wooded landscape.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level, level angle, the slightly unsteady camera initially captures a running boy from the side and then transitions to a front view. The camera moves to the right and slightly backward to follow his path, causing him to grow larger in the frame. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire forest scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A young boy with light skin walks through a wooded area. He is dressed in what appears to be early 20th-century attire, consisting of a dark, single-breasted jacket, dark knickerbockers, light-colored knee-high socks, dark boots, and a dark flat cap on his head. He navigates through a forest of tall, thin trees, passing a large fallen tree on the ground. A thin white string is tied between the standing trees, and the boy walks alongside it.",
    "Motion": "A young boy is in the frame from the start, moving forward before turning to the right as he navigates through a wooded area. He begins with a slightly faster pace, almost running, before settling into a steady walk over the grassy, uneven ground, following a path alongside a thin white string tied between the trees.",
    "Scene": "In a black-and-white scene set in a pine forest, a young boy walks across uneven, grassy terrain. Tall, slender pine trees stand in rows, with a thin white string stretched between several of them. A large, fallen tree with tangled branches lies horizontally in the foreground. The camera pans slightly to follow the boy as he navigates through the wooded landscape.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot opens on a forest scene with a large fallen tree in the left middle ground and standing trees in both the middle ground and background. A young boy appears in the right middle ground and initially runs towards the right. The camera trucks and pans right to follow him. Shortly after, he turns to his right and slows down, walking towards the right foreground. The camera then begins to move backward to keep him in view. As a result, more trees with thin white strings attached to them enter the frame from the right foreground. The camera is positioned at the boy's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
