  "merged_caption": "A smooth, arcing shot captures the rear windshield of a dark green car as the camera moves counterclockwise around it from a high angle, eye-level perspective. The car's dark body frames the windshield on the left, bottom, and right sides. In the middle strip of the glass, a series of white vinyl stickers is visible, including logos for \"GReddy,\" \"LTD,\" \"Haltech,\" \"neutrale,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown,\" with an additional, more intricate white sticker in the bottom center. A prominent reflection of the car's light green interior, possibly a panel or a roll cage, is cast across the center of the windshield, appearing in the background through the tinted glass. The tinted green window features several horizontal defroster lines. Bright sunlight creates a strong glare in the upper right portion of the frame, which also reflects the car's green interior and the bright outdoor surroundings. In the upper right corner of the frame, there is a shimmering reflection similar to that of a water surface. The camera smoothly moves in a counterclockwise arc around the rear of the car, capturing dynamic angles of the rear windshield. A deep focus keeps the entire vehicle and its reflections sharp.",

    "Subject": "A close-up view shows the rear windshield of a dark green car. The tinted glass has several white vinyl stickers applied to the middle strip of the rear windshield, including logos for \"GReddy,\" \"LTD,\" \"Haltech,\" \"neutrale,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown.\" A smaller, more intricate white sticker is visible in the bottom center of the glass. A reflection of the car's light green interior, possibly a panel or a roll cage, is cast across the windshield, along with a mirrored reflection of some of the stickers. The scene is lit by bright sunlight, which creates a strong glare in the upper right portion of the frame.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime shot focuses on the rear window of a dark green car. The tinted green window features several horizontal defroster lines. A collection of white stickers, including brand names like \"GReddy,\" \"Haltech,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown,\" is arranged across the middle strip of the glass. Another sticker with an intricate design is placed at the bottom center of the glass. Bright sunlight creates a glare on the glass, which also reflects the car's green interior and the bright outdoor surroundings.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
