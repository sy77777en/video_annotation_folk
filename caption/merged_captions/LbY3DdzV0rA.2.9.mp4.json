  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in a static extreme wide shot from a low angle, showcasing a dramatic time-lapse video of a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert landscape at dusk. The composition is dominated by a large storm system that fills the top and center of the frame, with turbulent, roiling clouds colored in deep purples, grays, and bright whites, illuminated from within by flashes of lightning. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, while remaining stationary throughout the video. Below this, a silhouetted mountain range extends across the frame just above the bottom edge, standing against the last light of sunset. The flat desert landscape occupies the bottom portion of the frame, with sparse, low-lying shrubs. Throughout the time-lapse, the clouds churn and expand rapidly, showcasing the storm's evolution, with flashes of light illuminating them from within, primarily in the center of the frame. Intermittent flashes of light pulse within the storm, and dark, vertical shafts of rain can be seen falling over the mountains. The sky is filled with a massive, churning storm cloud, its dark purple and grey masses brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, creating spectacular bursts of white and pink light. The colors within the storm intensify, contrasting with the faint orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low angle, looking up at the dramatic storm clouds. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, while remaining stationary throughout the video.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert at dusk. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. The sky is filled with a massive, churning storm cloud, its dark purple and grey masses brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, creating spectacular bursts of white and pink light. Below the turbulent cloud cover, a distant mountain range is silhouetted against the warm, orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.",
    "Motion": "This is a dramatic time-lapse video of a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert landscape at dusk. The sky is filled with turbulent, roiling clouds colored in deep purples, grays, and bright whites, illuminated from within by flashes of lightning. In the distance, silhouetted mountains stand against the last light of sunset. The clouds move and churn rapidly, showcasing the storm's evolution.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse sequence shows a massive storm system forming over a desert landscape at twilight. The sky is dominated by large, churning clouds that are dark gray and deep purple, with bright white and pink sections illuminated from within. These clouds swirl and expand above a distant, silhouetted mountain range. Intermittent flashes of light pulse within the storm, and dark, vertical shafts of rain can be seen falling over the mountains. The foreground is a flat, arid expanse with sparse, low-lying shrubs. Throughout the sequence, the colors within the storm intensify, contrasting with the faint orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.",

Throughout the time-lapse, the clouds churn and expand, with flashes of light illuminating them from within, primarily in the center of the frame. Dark shafts of rain are visible falling from the clouds onto the distant mountains."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
