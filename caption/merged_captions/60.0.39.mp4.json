  "merged_caption": "The video begins with significant motion blur and a heavily obstructed view. A large, dark, out-of-focus form, likely one of the players, dominates the right foreground and extends towards the center, largely obscuring the subjects and the scene. A small, light-colored, roundish object, identified as the soccer ball, is visible on the left side. After the out-of-focus form briefly moves across the camera, the view transitions to a full shot of the field and players. The scene then captures the soccer ball and five players in the middle ground, with the field occupying the bottom portion of both the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a brown building is positioned further back. The camera is at hip level, maintaining a level angle, and uses a deep focus with a large depth of field. It exhibits noticeable shaking as it pans from right to left. Five girls are running across the green field, moving away from the camera toward the goal as they chase a soccer ball. Four girls in yellow team uniforms surround and pursue a girl in blue who is dribbling past them, attempting to gain possession of the ball. Their synchronized movement and shared focus highlight the intensity and coordination of the group activity. The scene is set outdoors in bright daylight, with sparse trees situated behind the goal. The overall visual quality is low, characterized by significant motion blur. The framing is dynamic due to pronounced camera shake, causing the foreground form to appear to shift, which alters the visible portions of the field, the background building, and intermittently reveals parts of the subjects if the video were playing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
