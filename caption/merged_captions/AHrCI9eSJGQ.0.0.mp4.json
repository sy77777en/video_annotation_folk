  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a seascape from the perspective of a container ship. Rows of shipping containers, in shades of blue, gray, and brown, occupy the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and converging toward the center. The ocean extends from the middle ground to the background, stretching to the horizon, which is positioned centrally in the frame. The sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame, with clouds scattered throughout and a larger cloud formation on the right. A watermark is located in the bottom right corner, and multiple lines of text are overlaid at the bottom center. The camera is positioned high on the bow of the ship, maintaining a level angle and deep focus, and moves forward smoothly and quickly with the ship. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video with mild barrel distortion, capturing the scene as the ship sails on the open ocean. The camera looks out over stacks of shipping containers towards a dramatic, colorful sky at either sunrise or sunset. The sky transitions from a soft pink and orange glow at the horizon to a deep teal-blue above, under a blanket of scattered, wispy clouds and a more formidable cloud bank to the right. Initially, overlay text at the bottom reads: \"Knowing that our existence is nothing in comparison to the vastness of the universe motivates me to work hard in life to make a difference in the world. Thrive, don't just exist.\" This text disappears quickly, and after a while, it changes to a subtitle: \"Timestamps are in the description below corresponding to the narration of events (i.e., Thunderstorms, Torrent Rain, Arrival/Departure Ports).\"",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video with mild barrel distortion. Positioned high on a cargo ship between overhead and aerial level, the camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly and quickly.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic seascape shot from the perspective of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and atmospheric conditions, with no single main subject. Prominently featured in the foreground and extending into the middle ground, stacks of shipping containers effectively direct the viewer's gaze towards the vast, calm sea stretching to the horizon. Above, the sky is a breathtaking canvas of soft pinks and purples near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset, transitioning into a deep teal higher up, all under a blanket of scattered, wispy clouds and a more formidable cloud bank to the right.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, wide-angle shot from the bow of a large container ship at sea. The camera looks out over stacks of shipping containers towards a dramatic, colorful sky at either sunrise or sunset. The vast ocean stretches to the horizon under a cloudy, pastel-colored sky.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the scene looks out over rows of stacked shipping containers toward the open sea. The containers, in shades of blue, gray, and brown, fill the foreground and extend to the middle ground. The vast ocean is calm under a sky transitioning from a soft pink and orange glow at the horizon to a deep teal-blue above, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. Scattered clouds are present, with a large cloud formation on the right. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a YouTube watermark for 'JEFFHK'. Initially, overlay text at the bottom reads: \"Knowing that our existence is nothing in comparison to the vastness of the universe motivates me to work hard in life to make a difference in the world. Thrive, don't just exist.\" This text disappears quickly, and after a while, it changes to a subtitle: \"Timestamps are in the description below corresponding to the narration of events (i.e., Thunderstorms, Torrent Rain, Arrival/Departure Ports).\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
