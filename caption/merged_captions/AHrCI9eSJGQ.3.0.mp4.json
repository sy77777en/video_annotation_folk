  "merged_caption": "This video is presented as a fixed extreme wide scenery shot from a level perspective from a high vantage point on a massive container ship, capturing a time-lapse view of its journey across the sea. The foreground is filled with stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers, forming a V-shape that recedes toward the center, leading the eye out to the open ocean. The sea stretches from the middle ground to the horizon in the background, appearing smooth and still. In the background, a vast sky with fast-moving, time-lapsed clouds fills the top half of the screen, tinged with warm, golden-orange light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The camera, positioned between overhead and aerial level, looks straight ahead with a level angle, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. Using a deep focus, it keeps the containers in the foreground and middle ground, and the sea extending to the background, sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward, capturing the ship's journey across the water. Slightly left of center on the horizon, the silhouette of a lone, distant vessel is faintly visible. An overlay in the bottom center displays white text that reads, \"The Straits have an established Traffic Separation Scheme. That is why most nearby ships are going in the same direction.\" In the bottom right corner, a red and white \"YouTube JEFFHK\" watermark is present. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the ocean and the atmospheric, dynamic sky, making the vast environment itself the focus of the shot.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a high position on a cargo ship, between overhead and aerial level, looking straight ahead with a level angle. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion. Using a deep focus, the camera keeps the containers in the foreground and middle ground, and the sea extending from the middle ground to the background, sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward, capturing the ship's journey across the water.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured from the bow of a massive container ship looking out over the open ocean. The foreground features stacked rows of red, blue, and orange shipping containers, which frame the expansive view ahead. The sea is calm, stretching to the horizon where a lone, distant vessel is faintly visible. Above, a vast, time-lapsed sky is filled with streaky, fast-moving clouds illuminated by a warm, golden-orange light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the ocean and the atmospheric, dynamic sky, making the vast environment itself the focus of the shot.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide-angle, time-lapse view from the bow of a massive container ship at sea. The foreground is filled with stacks of colorful shipping containers, leading the eye out to the open ocean under a dramatic and warmly lit cloudy sky. The video is a time-lapse, which is evident from the clouds moving rapidly across the sky.",
    "Scene": "From the bow of a large container ship, the view looks out over a calm sea under a cloud-filled sky. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers are filling the foreground and extending toward the horizon. The sky is filled with fast-moving clouds, tinged with warm orange light. The water surface appears smooth and still. In the distance, the silhouette of another ship is visible on the horizon. An overlay in the bottom center displays white text that reads, \"The Straits have an established Traffic Separation Scheme. That is why most nearby ships are going in the same direction.\" In the bottom right corner, a red and white \"YouTube JEFFHK\" watermark is present.",
    "Spatial": "This video is presented as a fixed extreme wide scenery shot from a level perspective from a high vantage point. The foreground is filled by shipping containers that extend from the bottom foreground to the lower center middle ground, forming a V-shape that recedes toward the center. The sea stretches from the middle ground to the horizon in the background. In the background, a vast sky with fast-moving, time-lapsed clouds fills the top half of the screen, while a small, distant ship is visible slightly left of center on the horizon. A text overlay is statically positioned in the bottom center of the frame, and a watermark is located in the bottom right corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
