  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a propeller-driven aircraft with a long fuselage painted reddish-brown on top and white on the underside is positioned in the left-middle ground, flying over brown hills that occupy the background along the bottom of the frame. The aircraft, featuring a bulbous nose and two wings, flies steadily from right to left across the frame, towing a large, conical object behind it. A large, fluffy white cumulus cloud is situated in the right-middle ground, with part of it extending into the right foreground, filling the upper right portion of the frame against a vast, clear blue sky. The aircraft moves horizontally from its initial position toward the left edge of the frame, initially maintaining a straight and level flight path over the desert landscape. As it progresses, the aircraft gradually starts to bank to its right, moving away from the large white cloud on the right. From a low angle, the camera pans slowly and smoothly from right to left, following the airplane as it flies across the sky. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the plane and the distant mountains in sharp detail. The camera is positioned below the aircraft, capturing the scene as the plane travels from right to left, away from the large cloud, contrasting with the otherwise clear sky.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, the camera pans slowly and smoothly from right to left, following an airplane as it flies across the sky. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping both the plane and the distant mountains in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A propeller-driven aircraft flies in the sky, with its underside painted white and the top painted red. The plane appears to be trailing something behind it, possibly a parachute, as it moves away from a large, white, and puffy cumulus cloud to its right.",
    "Motion": "A propeller-driven aircraft flies steadily from right to left across the frame, towing a large, conical object behind it. The aircraft initially maintains a straight and level flight path over a desert landscape but gradually starts to bank to its right, moving away from a large white cloud on the right.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime scene set against a vast, clear blue sky, a uniquely designed aircraft flies over the tops of rolling brown hills. The aircraft features a long fuselage with a reddish-brown and white pattern, with reddish-brown on the top and white on the underside, and has two wings. Its bulbous nose, painted similarly to the rest of the aircraft, leads the way as it travels from right to left. The aircraft is flying away from a large, fluffy white cloud, which contrasts with the otherwise clear sky.",
    "Spatial": "In this wide shot, an aircraft is positioned in the left-middle ground, flying over brown hills that occupy the background along the bottom of the frame. A large cloud is situated in the right-middle ground, with part of it extending into the right foreground, filling the upper right portion of the frame against a blue sky. The aircraft moves horizontally from its initial position toward the left edge of the frame. The camera slightly pans to the left and is positioned below the aircraft."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
