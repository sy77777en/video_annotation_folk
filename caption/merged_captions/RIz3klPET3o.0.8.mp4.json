  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a side-view 2D game featuring a simple, animated stick figure riding a bicycle, consistently tracked by the camera as it moves smoothly rightward and downward. The stick figure, minimalistic with basic lines for the body and limbs, a small circle for the head, and a round hat, is positioned near the center, slightly towards the right of the frame. A scarf-like accessory with white, red, green, and blue accents trails behind, adding to the sense of motion. The figure moves from left to right against a plain light gray background, initially positioned on a long horizontal line next to the number \"26.\" As the video progresses, the character navigates various black lines and shapes, including ramps and jumps, creating a dynamic path. The stick figure rides the bicycle downward along a specific trajectory on a black line, occasionally leaning forward or backward as it encounters jumps and ramps. It interacts with line-drawn objects and numbers, such as \"30\" and \"34,\" which serve as additional jumping points, indicating progression through the abstract, monochromatic landscape. The motion is dynamic, with the figure maintaining balance while interacting with the minimalist environment. The path includes curved ramps, triangles, and semi-circular forms, with the stick figure primarily descending after launching into the air, followed by a final ascent along a black line ramp. The consistent camera perspective maintains focus on the character's interaction with the geometric shapes, emphasizing the playful and dynamic action as the scene unfolds in this minimalist, 2D environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a simple, animated scene with a stick figure riding a bicycle, primarily facing to the right of the frame. The stick figure is minimalistic, with basic lines representing the body and limbs, a small circle for the head, and a round hat on top. A scarf-like accessory with white, red, green, and blue accents trails behind the figure. The bicycle is drawn with simple lines, showing one visible wheel and a frame, with the figure's hands positioned on the handlebars. The stick figure moves to the right along a black line, descending and tumbling. The path includes jumps or ramps, which the stick figure navigates, suggesting playful or dynamic action. In the middle of the video, various simple line-drawn objects and numbers appear, representing additional jumping points or ramps. The overall style is minimalist, focusing on the movement of the stick figure and bicycle along the line.",

    "Scene": "A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character unfolds in a minimalist, 2D environment with a plain light gray background. The scene features a small, stick-figure-like character, distinguished by a hat and colorful dots, navigating a series of black, hand-drawn lines and geometric shapes that serve as platforms. Initially, the character is seen on a long horizontal line next to the number \"26,\" with a ramp-like structure to the right and disconnected short lines to the left. As the video progresses, the character moves across various evolving black-outlined shapes, including curved ramps, triangles, and semi-circular forms, while numbers such as \"30\" and \"34\" appear, indicating progression through the abstract, monochromatic landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
