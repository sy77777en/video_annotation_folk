  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a night-time forest scene, with the focus on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene is framed from a first-person, eye-level perspective, as if through the character’s eyes, and the camera moves smoothly forward and to the right through a dark forest illuminated by glowing orbs. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp. A circular gauge is in the top left, a crosshair in the bottom left, and text prompts in the top right of the video game heads-up display. The dark ground occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. Tall, silhouetted trees are visible in the middle ground and background, framing the scene on the left and right. Dozens of small, bright, glowing orbs, resembling fireflies, are scattered throughout the middle ground and background, filling the dark space between the trees. Most of these orbs are white, with a few appearing blue, creating an ethereal atmosphere. The strong contrast between these point-like lights and the surrounding darkness results in a mysterious and enchanting nocturnal woodland. Overlays on the screen display a heads-up display (HUD). In the top left corner, a circular gauge indicates O2 and Fuel levels. In the bottom left, the text \"GRAVITY 0.4x\" is displayed above and slightly to the left of a crosshair reticle. In the top right corner, text prompts for game controls are visible. The absence of a central subject directs attention to the overall mood and the distribution of these luminous particles, enhancing the immersive experience of the video game set within this dark forest.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a night-time forest scenery shot, where the focus is on the ethereal atmosphere created by numerous small, glowing orbs rather than a specific subject. These orbs, predominantly bright white with a few interspersed blue ones, are scattered throughout the dark environment, illuminating the silhouettes of tall, indistinct trees and the dimly lit ground. The scene is characterized by a strong contrast between these point-like lights and the surrounding darkness, with the overall effect being one of a mysterious and enchanting nocturnal woodland. The absence of a central subject directs attention to the overall mood and the distribution of these luminous particles.",
    "Motion": "This is a first-person view from a video game set within a dark forest. The scene is illuminated by dozens of glowing orbs, resembling fireflies, scattered amongst the trees. The game's heads-up display is visible in the corners of the screen.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set within a dark forest at night. Tall, silhouetted trees are visible against the blackness. The scene is illuminated by dozens of small, bright, glowing orbs that float and drift through the air, most of which are white, with a few appearing blue. The ground is dark and indistinct. Overlays on the screen display a heads-up display (HUD). In the top left corner, a circular gauge indicates O2 and Fuel levels. In the bottom left, the text \"GRAVITY 0.4x\" is displayed above and slightly to the left of a crosshair reticle. In the top right corner, text prompts for game controls are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
