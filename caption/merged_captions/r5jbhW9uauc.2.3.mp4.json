  "merged_caption": "Initially, voluminous plumes of pink liquid occupy the top left and extend towards the center, while blue/cyan liquid plumes are positioned in the top right, also extending towards the center, all primarily in the middle ground against a black background. These colored masses slowly rise and expand, with tendrils of pink moving from the left towards the center and top, and tendrils of blue/cyan moving from the right towards the center and top. The two colors intermingle in the central middle ground, creating mixed hues of purple. Throughout the video, numerous small droplets of pink, blue/cyan, and mixed colors detach from these main plumes and fall downwards across the entire frame, from top to bottom, appearing in the foreground as they create streaks. The overall dynamic is a combination of upward movement from the ink clouds and downward motion from the droplets and streaks, with the ink pattern becoming sparser over time, revealing more of the black background. The video is in slow motion, with the camera stationary and using a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the colored liquids interact. The liquids have a viscous, almost gelatinous appearance as they ascend and expand, forming and dissipating tendrils and plumes. The pink and blue/cyan liquids continuously billow and swirl at the top of the frame, with delicate tendrils and wispy formations extending and drifting downwards. As the pink and blue/cyan liquids intermingle, areas of purple and mixed hues become visible. Numerous small, distinct droplets of the same pink and blue/cyan colors are seen detaching from the main masses and slowly descending, creating streaks and trails. The overall effect is a dynamic and evolving mixture of these contrasting colors.",

    "Camera": "This is a slow-motion video. The camera is stationary and uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground where the colored liquids are interacting.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases an abstract visual of brightly colored liquids, predominantly vibrant pink and luminous blue/cyan, interacting within a dark, likely black, medium. These liquids form voluminous, cloud-like plumes that billow and swirl, with delicate tendrils and wispy formations extending downwards. As the pink and blue/cyan liquids intermingle, areas of purple and mixed hues become visible. Numerous small, distinct droplets of the same pink and blue/cyan colors are seen detaching from the main masses and slowly descending, creating streaks and trails. The overall effect is a dynamic and evolving mixture of these contrasting colors.",
    "Motion": "Voluminous, cloud-like plumes of bright pink and luminous blue/cyan liquid continuously billow and swirl at the top of the frame. From these main masses, delicate tendrils and wispy formations extend and drift downwards. The pink and blue/cyan liquids intermingle as they move, their colors blending. Simultaneously, numerous small, distinct droplets of both colors detach from the larger plumes and the descending tendrils, slowly falling downwards and creating visible streaks and trails through the dark medium.",
    "Scene": "A cloud of vibrant pink and cyan ink billows and swirls upwards against a stark black background. The two colors intermingle, creating shades of purple where they meet. Droplets of both pink and cyan, as well as mixed purple, detach from the main cloud and rise, leaving thin trails. The ink has a viscous, almost gelatinous appearance as it slowly ascends and expands, with tendrils and plumes forming and dissipating.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
