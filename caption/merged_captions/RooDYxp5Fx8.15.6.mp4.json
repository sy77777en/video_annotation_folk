  "merged_caption": "This wide, first-person POV shot is captured from a sidewalk in the left foreground, which features a stone curb extending into the middle ground. The asphalt road occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the immediate foreground into the background. Initially, a dark blue van is prominent in the right foreground, moving towards the center. A traditional corner building is visible in the right middle ground, with pedestrians nearby. As the video progresses, the dark blue van moves from the right foreground, across the center, and recedes into the left background. On the side closer to the camera, a green bus on the left side of the frame, the dark blue van, and a small dark blue car appear from the right side of the frame, all moving from right to left. On the opposite side of the road, a green bus with side advertisements, a white kei van, and several other vehicles cross the intersection from left to right. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a deep focus to keep a large depth of field. It moves forward, then pans left, and subsequently continues to move forward along the sidewalk, with some shaking. The buildings on both sides of the road and the distant hills remain static in the middle ground and background, framing the vehicular movement, while utility wires and traffic lights at the intersection are visible overhead across the top of the frame. A sunlit street scene in a Japanese town is captured, with a gray and white traditional building, a small pine tree, and a stone lantern coming into view as the camera pans left. A two-story corner building exhibits traditional Japanese architecture with a tiled roof and signage in Japanese characters. Overhead, numerous utility wires crisscross the clear blue sky, with green hills visible in the distant background.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The camera moves forward, then pans left, and subsequently continues to move forward along the sidewalk. This movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of a bustling street corner in a Japanese town. The focus is on the dynamic movement of vehicles traveling back and forth on the road, pedestrians coming and going on the opposite sidewalk, and the distinct Japanese architectural style of the surrounding buildings. The camera's perspective and movement suggest an observational stance, aiming to convey the general ambiance and activity of the location.",
    "Motion": "A green bus with an advertisement on its side is seen moving through an intersection, traveling towards the right side of the frame and exiting from there. A blue van enters the frame from the right, continues to move forward, passing the green bus, and heads towards the left side of the frame. As the blue van moves further, a white van appears from the left side of the frame and follows the path initially taken by the green bus. The blue van continues to drive away, and a black car enters the frame from the right, following the same path. The black car continues to move forward, and the blue van is now further down the road. The black car follows the blue van, and the white van is now further down the road. The black car continues to follow the blue van, and the white van is almost out of the frame, exiting from the right side. Several other vehicles follow the same path through the intersection.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a sunlit street scene in a Japanese town. The asphalt road, marked with white lines and circular manhole covers, carries light traffic. To the left, a sidewalk paved with multi-toned rectangular tiles runs alongside a gray and white traditional building, in front of which stand a small pine tree and a stone lantern that comes into view as the camera pans left. Further in the background, a modern building with large glass windows and a residential building are visible. On the right, a two-story corner building exhibits traditional Japanese architecture with a tiled roof and signage in Japanese characters; two pedestrians, one with a red umbrella, stand nearby. Overhead, numerous utility wires crisscross the clear blue sky, with green hills visible in the distant background. A traffic light shows a green signal.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
