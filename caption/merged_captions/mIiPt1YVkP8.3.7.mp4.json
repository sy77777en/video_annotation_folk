  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot captured from a high angle, the scene presents a grainy, black-and-white nighttime view of an airport. Numerous out-of-focus lights are scattered across the foreground, middle ground, and background, indicating runways, taxiways, and distant city lights on the horizon. In the middle ground, the silhouettes of stationary airplanes are visible along the horizontal line in the middle of the frame. An airplane with intensely bright white lights begins in the middle ground on the right, moves toward the center across the frame on the ground, and then ascends, flying diagonally toward the top left after it passes over the other aircraft. Before it takes off, it passes by the silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes near the runway or taxiway. The aircraft then gains altitude, executing a takeoff, and continues its upward and leftward trajectory, moving across the screen while other stationary aircraft remain on the tarmac below. From a smooth, aerial-level, and high-angle perspective, the camera pans left to track the planes on the runway. The video is blurry, but appears to have a deep focus. Near the runway or taxiway, there are white silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes. The moving plane passes by these stationary aircraft, with its bright landing lights illuminated, as it flies across the frame. Additionally, there are several stationary passenger planes on the ground. In the surrounding area, the faint silhouettes of other airplanes are visible on the ground, amidst numerous out-of-focus lights from the airport.",

    "Subject": "This grainy, black-and-white nighttime video captures a scene at an airport. An airplane, identifiable by its intensely bright white lights, is initially moving on the ground from right to center. It then takes off and continues flying toward the top left. Near the runway or taxiway, there are white silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes. The moving plane passes by these stationary aircraft.

    "Motion": "In a grainy, black-and-white nighttime view of an airport, an airplane with its lights illuminated moves from right to center across the frame on the ground. Before it takes off, it passes by the silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes near the runway or taxiway. The aircraft then gains altitude, executing a takeoff, and continues its upward and leftward trajectory, moving across the screen while other stationary aircraft remain on the tarmac below.",
    "Scene": "A monochromatic, nighttime view captures an airport scene. Numerous bright, blurry lights dot the dark landscape, indicating runways, taxiways, and distant city lights on the horizon. One airplane is in motion, initially moving on the ground from the right to the center, then taking off and flying towards the top left. Near the runway or taxiway, silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes are visible. The moving plane passes by these stationary aircraft, with its bright landing lights illuminated, as it flies across the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
