  "merged_caption": "A medium shot, filmed from a low angle, captures a woman from the waist up, positioned centrally in the frame as she walks toward the camera. The woman has long, wavy blonde hair and fair skin, wearing a white, double-breasted trench coat with prominent black outlines on the lapels, belt, and buttons, giving it an illustrated appearance. A white eyepatch covers her right eye, and she has red lipstick on her puckered lips, as if she is whistling. She also wears white gloves and carries a white handbag with a black strap over her right shoulder. The camera moves backward at the same pace, keeping her consistently in the foreground and maintaining her central position and shot size throughout the clip. As she advances, the camera lead-tracks her, keeping her centered in the frame. The scene is set within a long, brightly lit indoor hallway with plain, light-colored walls and a tiled ceiling. A continuous row of rectangular fluorescent lights illuminates the space. As the camera retreats down the hallway, background elements like walls, ceiling lights, and doors shift from the center toward the edges of the frame. Various features become visible along the walls, including several doors, a red fire alarm box, and a convex security mirror mounted near the ceiling. In the background, glimpses of office furniture, such as cabinets and a desk, can be seen. The use of deep focus keeps both the woman and her surroundings in sharp detail. Throughout her walk, her lips are puckered, and she whistles a tune.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, low, hip-level angle, the camera moves backward, leading a woman in a white coat as she walks down a hallway. The use of deep focus keeps both the woman and her surroundings in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, wavy blonde hair and fair skin walks forward. She wears a white, double-breasted trench coat with prominent black outlines on the lapels, belt, and buttons, giving it an illustrated appearance. A white eyepatch covers her right eye, and she has red lipstick on her puckered lips, as if she is whistling. She also wears white gloves and carries a white handbag with a black strap over her right shoulder.",
    "Motion": "A woman walks steadily down a hallway, moving directly toward the low-angle camera. As she advances, the camera lead-tracks her, keeping her centered in the frame. Throughout her walk, her lips are puckered, and she whistles a tune.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a long, brightly lit indoor hallway with plain, light-colored walls and a tiled ceiling. A continuous row of rectangular fluorescent lights illuminates the space. As the perspective moves steadily backward down the corridor, various features become visible along the walls, including several doors, a red fire alarm box, and a convex security mirror mounted near the ceiling. In the background, glimpses of office furniture, such as cabinets and a desk, can be seen.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot, filmed from a low angle, captures a woman from the waist up, positioned centrally in the frame as she walks toward the camera.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
