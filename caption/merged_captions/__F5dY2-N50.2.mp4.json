  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an outdoor patio, with no main subjects. The shot begins with a view of lush green foliage in the background at the top of the frame and a low white wall in the middle ground. The camera, from a somewhat low angle, tilts down to reveal the full patio, transitioning from a slightly high angle to a more pronounced high angle. The patio floor is made of smooth, grey material, with matching stepping stones leading onto a patch of light-colored sand. In the sandy area stands a large tree with a dark, textured trunk, surrounded by green plants. In the final composition, a round, glass-topped table is positioned in the center, slightly to the left, in the middle ground. Two chairs are partially visible at the bottom edge of the frame in the foreground. To the right, two lounge chairs sit in the middle ground, while a sandy area with a large tree occupies the left middle ground. The white wall and foliage now form the background at the top of the frame. The patio is furnished with a round, glass-topped table on a dark woven base, two woven chairs with grey cushions on top, and two long, grey lounge chairs with cushions resting against a white wall. A small, white, square box sits in the center of the table. Beyond the white wall, dense green foliage and trees are visible under natural light. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The composition is designed to immerse the viewer in the environment, emphasizing the blend of comfortable design with natural, private surroundings rather than focusing on a specific person or action.",

    "Camera": "From a somewhat low angle, the relatively shaky camera tilts down to view the patio furniture, transitioning from a slightly high angle to a more pronounced high angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures an architectural scenery shot of a secluded outdoor patio, likely at a tropical resort. The space features a modern grey-paved area with a round, glass-topped wicker table and cushioned lounge chairs, which gives way to a sandy garden with a large tree and lush green foliage bordered by a low white wall. There is no main subject because the focus is on establishing a sense of place and a tranquil atmosphere. The composition is designed to immerse the viewer in the environment, emphasizing the blend of comfortable design with natural, private surroundings rather than focusing on a specific person or action.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot with some slight camera movement. The video shows a private outdoor patio area in what appears to be a tropical resort. The patio features a round glass-topped table, chairs, and lounge beds, and it opens up to a sandy area with a large tree and lush green foliage.",
    "Scene": "A tilt down reveals an outdoor patio in a tropical setting during the daytime.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
