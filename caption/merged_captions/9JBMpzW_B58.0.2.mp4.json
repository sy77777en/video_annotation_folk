  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no single main subject, focusing instead on the environment. The level-angle shot is captured from the bow of a container ship, looking forward. Shipping containers occupy the bottom half of the frame, arranged symmetrically in the foreground and middle ground, leading the viewer's eye toward the center. The calm ocean fills the middle horizontal section of the frame, stretching to the horizon in the background. The sky dominates the top half of the frame in the background, where a time-lapse shows clouds streaking across the scene as the sky transitions from blue daylight to a pink and purple dusk, eventually revealing stars. The camera moves forward quickly as the ship sails across the ocean, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene from the containers in the foreground to the horizon sharp. Mild barrel distortion is visible, causing a slight outward curve at the edges of the frame. The primary focus is the dramatic transformation of the sky; initially, wispy clouds drift across a blue canvas, which then gives way to a spectacular sunset, painting the clouds in vibrant shades of pink and purple. As darkness falls, the colors deepen, and stars begin to emerge in the night sky. A text overlay is present on the right, displaying \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" alongside Instagram and YouTube icons.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a perspective between an aerial level and an overhead level on the bow of a freighter. The camera moves forward quickly as the ship sails across the ocean. Mild barrel distortion is visible, causing a slight outward curve at the edges of the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the containers in the foreground to the horizon sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a stunning time-lapse seascape, captured from a level-angle perspective aboard a massive container ship. The view looks forward from the bow, over rows of blue, red, and white shipping containers, towards the endless, calm ocean. The primary focus is the dramatic transformation of the sky; initially, wispy clouds drift across a blue canvas, which then gives way to a spectacular sunset, painting the clouds in vibrant shades of pink and purple. As darkness falls, the colors deepen, and stars begin to emerge in the night sky. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vastness of the open sea and the dynamic, atmospheric beauty of the changing sky, making the environment itself the central focus.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a time-lapse view from the bow of a container ship sailing on the open ocean. The sky is the main focus, with clouds moving rapidly across the frame. The scene transitions from daylight to a vibrant sunset with pink and purple hues, eventually revealing stars as night falls.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video captures the view from the bow of a container ship sailing on the open ocean. The foreground and middle ground are filled with rows of stacked shipping containers, primarily in blue, red, and white. The vast, dark sea stretches to a flat horizon. The sky undergoes a transition from daytime to dusk; clouds streak across a blue sky which gradually fills with pink and purple hues, and a few stars become visible. A text overlay is present on the right, displaying \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" alongside Instagram and YouTube icons.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
