  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a very pale purple dress shirt that is almost white. He has a bald head, dark eyes, and a small amount of facial hair above his mouth, and is speaking into a headset microphone. The man occupies most of the frame, initially positioned slightly off-center to the left, facing towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus. It initially pans slightly to the left to keep the speaker in frame. As the video progresses, the man moves horizontally across the frame from left to right, maintaining a consistent distance from the camera. The camera pans to the right with noticeable shakiness, tracking the speaker's movement. The man is speaking and gesturing with his hands while moving to the right, occasionally smiling and appearing engaged with his audience. In the middle of his presentation, he noticeably pulls his shoulders back, adding emphasis to his speech. The man remains in the foreground throughout, with the large screen in the background serving as a static backdrop. The screen displays graphics, including a city skyline silhouette in the upper portion of the frame and text in the lower portion, indicating a TEDx event at Ryerson University, with the event's name and the phrase 'independently organized TED event' visible. The environment suggests a formal presentation atmosphere, with the screen providing visual context and information related to the event. The lighting is focused on the stage, creating a contrast between the illuminated speaker and the darker background. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, capturing his upper body and head as he moves, ensuring the subject stays centered and prominent in the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
