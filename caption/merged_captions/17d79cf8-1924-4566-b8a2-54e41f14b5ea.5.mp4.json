  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is framed looking down during a bright day. The subject's hands are in the center foreground, with their legs clad in dark shorts with a purple and white pattern visible at the bottom center. The left hand, positioned centrally, lowers a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a low wall that extends from the bottom left to the center of the frame, placing it onto a layer of wet, grey mortar. The hand then presses down on the brick, adjusting it slightly to set it into place. To the right, a set of concrete stairs occupies the middle ground, running from the top to the bottom of the frame, with thin white strings draped across them. The background in the top left shows reddish-brown dirt, loose gravel, patches of green vegetation, and a coiled blue hose. The video is captured from a shaky, first-person, head-mounted perspective at eye level. The camera angle begins as a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot as the person looks down to place a brick on a wall. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene in focus. The construction is taking place next to the stairs, with the person's right hand holding another identical brick.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with a dark skin tone, wearing dark shorts with a purple and white pattern, is laying bricks. They use their left hand to carefully place a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a layer of wet, grey mortar on a low wall. In their right hand, they hold another identical brick. The construction is taking place next to a set of concrete stairs, with thin white strings looped on the stairs.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person lowers a brick with their left hand and places it onto a layer of wet mortar on a low wall. The hand then presses down on the brick, adjusting it slightly to set it into place.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor construction scene during a bright day. The perspective looks down at a low wall being built with rectangular, reddish-orange clay bricks laid upon a bed of wet, grey mortar. A white string is looped around the stairs, lying loosely across them. The ground consists of reddish-brown dirt, loose gravel, and patches of green vegetation, with a coiled blue hose visible in the background. The person's hands are seen positioning a brick, while their legs, clad in patterned shorts, are visible below.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is framed looking down. The subject's hands are in the center foreground, with their legs and patterned shorts visible at the bottom center. The left hand, positioned centrally, lowers a brick onto a low wall that extends from the bottom left to the center of the frame. To the right, a set of concrete stairs occupies the middle ground, running from the top to the bottom of the frame, with white strings draped across them. The background in the top left shows dirt, plants, and a coiled blue hose. The primary movement is the left hand pressing the brick down onto the mortar."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
