  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man's face, which occupies almost the left half of the frame, positioned in the foreground. He is shown in profile, facing towards the right side of the frame. An earring is visible on his right ear, which appears on the left side of the frame. In the background, primarily on the right side of the frame, several out-of-focus circular bokeh lights are present. The camera is static at eye level, maintaining a level angle, and employs an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the man's face in the foreground. Initially, the young man has his eyes closed, and he slowly opens them, maintaining a focused gaze to the right of the frame. The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit environment. The background is significantly out of focus, appearing as a dark space punctuated by several soft, circular bokeh lights of varying brightness. The overall atmosphere is subdued, with the primary focus on the foreground subject, while the surrounding area remains indistinct and dark. The young man has a short black buzz-cut hairstyle and a serious, focused expression, with closed comedones visible on his face.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
