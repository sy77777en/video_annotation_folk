  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person's leg in blue pants is running and occupies most of the foreground. The camera, from a shaky, high-angle, ground-level perspective, moves rapidly to the left, tracking the subject from the side. In the middle ground, the legs and feet of several other people are visible running towards the left on a dirt path covered in leaves, but their position remains stationary within the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' leg level and moves along with them, creating significant motion blur throughout the scene, which indicates rapid movement. The scene is set outdoors in a wooded area during the day, with the ground covered in a mixture of dirt, grass, and leaves in shades of brown and green, with small red leaves scattered about. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of several people are running on the uneven, leafy ground. One person wears light-colored pants, while another individual is seen wearing dark pants and dark boots. A shallow depth of field keeps the foreground in focus, emphasizing the dynamic, motion-filled scene.",

    "Subject": "In the foreground, a person's legs are visible, wearing blue pants and brown furry boots. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of several people are running on ground covered in dirt and leaves. One person wears light-colored pants, while another individual is seen wearing dark pants and dark boots.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves shakily and rapidly to the left, following the lower legs and feet of several people as they run across a dirt path covered in leaves. A person in blue pants is prominently visible running in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "A dynamic, motion-filled scene is set outdoors in a wooded area during the day. The ground is covered in a mixture of dirt, grass, and leaves in shades of brown and green, with small red leaves scattered about. A large form, which is a person's legs in blue pants, occupies most of the foreground. In the middle ground, several people are visible running on the uneven, leafy ground. The scene exhibits some motion blur, indicating rapid movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
