  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a finger interacting with a teal control panel with a matte finish. Initially, the finger is positioned in the center-left of the frame and moves to the top-left by the end, pressing three different buttons labeled with white text, such as \"RAD NAV\" and \"PROG,\" on a dark green panel. The control panel occupies the majority of the frame, with its black buttons extending from the foreground to the background. The digital display is located in the center-right, showing bright green and blue text against a black background, indicating various data points and numbers. The camera is positioned at a high angle, starting with a shallow focus on the buttons in the foreground. As the finger moves from right to left and then slightly upwards, the focus shifts to the finger, followed by a gradual shift to the screen in the background. The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern. The hand, with a light skin tone, is actively engaged in pressing these buttons, suggesting interaction with the device's interface, which appears to be part of a technical or navigational system. The focus is on the hand's movement and the illuminated text on the screen, maintaining the close-up framing throughout.",

    "Motion": "A finger presses three different buttons on a dark green control panel, moving from right to left and then slightly upwards.",
    "Scene": "The scene depicts a close-up view of a control panel with a digital display, set indoors. The panel is teal with a matte finish, featuring a series of black buttons labeled with white text, such as \"RAD NAV\" and \"PROG.\" The display screen shows bright green and blue text against a black background, indicating various data points and numbers. A finger is interacting with the panel, pressing buttons, which suggests active engagement with the device.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a close-up shot of a finger interacting with a control panel. Initially, the finger is positioned in the center-left of the frame and moves to the top-left by the end. The control panel occupies the majority of the frame, with its teal surface and black buttons extending from the foreground to the background. The digital display is located in the center-right, showing green and blue text against a black screen. The camera is positioned above the subjects, capturing the finger's movements and the illuminated text. As the finger moves, the focus shifts slightly to different buttons, maintaining the close-up framing throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
