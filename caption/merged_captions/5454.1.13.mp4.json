  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up, a man with brown skin, short dark braids, and a tattoo on his forehead occupies the middle ground center of the frame, captured from a low-angle perspective. He wears a dark jacket with large white text across the chest and black gloves. His clothing and gloved right hand are in the foreground, with his index finger pointing upward toward the top of the frame. The video begins with a low-angle shot at hip level, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the man's face in the midground, while the hand in the foreground and people in the background are blurred. The focus then shifts slightly to the man's clothing in the foreground, blurring both the face and the hand. The man looks down at the camera while holding his gloved right hand up with his index finger extended, speaking as his mouth moves. Although the man and the group of people behind him do not change their positions, they exhibit some movement, such as extending their hands. In the background, several other people are visible in the center and top right, silhouetted against the bright, overcast sky, with bare tree branches situated in the top left. These figures are at the top of what appears to be a staircase, with some individuals seemingly leaning against a railing, adding ambiguity to the scene. The faces of the silhouetted figures are not visible, making it unclear if they are looking at the sky or the staircase. The man's head is positioned in the middle ground, with his clothing and right hand in black gloves clearly visible in the foreground, while bare tree branches frame the upper portion of the view.",

    "Subject": "A man with brown skin, short dark braids, and a tattoo on his forehead looks down at the camera, which is positioned at a low angle. He wears a dark jacket with large white text across the chest and black gloves. He holds one gloved hand up with his index finger pointing towards the area above the camera.

    "Motion": "A man looks down at the camera while holding his gloved right hand up with his index finger extended, speaking as his mouth moves. Although the man and the group of people behind him do not change their positions, they exhibit some movement, such as extending their hands.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards an overcast, grey sky. A man wearing a dark jacket with a white background and dark lettering initially looks down at the camera before extending their gloved index finger. His head is positioned in the middle ground, with their clothing and right hand in black gloves clearly visible in the foreground,. Bare tree branches frame the upper portion of the view. At the top of what appears to be a staircase, several figures are silhouetted against the dim, daytime light, with their faces not visible, making it unclear if they are looking at the sky or the staircase. Some individuals seem to be leaning against a railing, adding ambiguity to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
