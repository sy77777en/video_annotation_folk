  "merged_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing a man with light skin, a full beard, and a mustache, wearing a dark cap, in profile, with his face oriented toward the right side of the frame. He appears middle-aged, with a neutral and focused expression, and his head is slightly tilted downward. The man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupies the middle ground, while the blurred upper part of a seat appears in the left foreground, partially obscuring the view. The car frame and window are visible on the far right in the background, with indistinct scenery outside. The camera is positioned at eye level on the rear right side of the driver, maintaining a level angle and tracking the driver from behind as the car moves forward. The camera moves forward and rightward in sync with the car, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the driver in the midground in focus while the background and foreground are blurred. The man sits in profile, facing to the right, with his head slightly tilted downward. As he speaks, his head exhibits slight shaking, and there are subtle movements in his mouth and facial expressions. The lighting highlights the contours of his face, emphasizing his facial hair. The video is set in a dimly lit indoor environment, likely inside a vehicle, with muted colors and soft, diffused lighting that casts gentle shadows across the scene. Subtitles are overlaid near the lower center, reading, “Price: Now if you’re having second thoughts, then I can do this on my own…,” which is not part of the physical environment but appears as a subtitle or caption. Black bars frame the top and bottom edges of the video, creating a widescreen, letterboxed effect.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin, a full beard, and a mustache, wearing a dark cap. He appears to be middle-aged and is shown in profile, facing to the right. His expression is neutral and focused, and his head is slightly tilted downward. The lighting highlights the contours of his face, emphasizing his facial hair. The man remains the central subject throughout the video, with no other human subjects visible.",
    "Motion": "The man sits in profile, facing to the right, with his head slightly tilted downward. As he speaks, his head exhibits slight shaking, and there are subtle movements in his mouth and facial expressions.",
    "Scene": "The video is set in a dimly lit indoor environment, likely inside a vehicle, with muted colors and soft, diffused lighting that casts gentle shadows across the scene. The camera angle is positioned from the back row, capturing the side profile of a bearded individual, likely the driver, from behind. Their face is partially illuminated, revealing subtle skin texture and short facial hair. In the left foreground, the upper part of the seat is prominently featured, appearing relatively blurred. On the right side, the car frame and window are visible, along with the blurred scenery outside. The background is indistinct, with subdued tones suggesting limited space and minimal visible detail beyond the subject. Overlay elements include a line of green and white text near the lower center of the scene that reads, “Price: Now if you’re having second thoughts, then I can do this on my own…,” which is not part of the physical environment but appears as a subtitle or caption. Black bars frame the top and bottom edges of the video, creating a widescreen, letterboxed effect.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the man’s head and upper shoulders in profile, with his face oriented toward the right side of the frame. The man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupies the middle ground, while the blurred upper part of a seat appears in the left foreground, partially obscuring the view. The car frame and window are visible on the far right in the background, with indistinct scenery outside. The camera is at the same height as the man’s head, capturing his profile directly from the back row. The spatial arrangement remains static throughout the video, with no significant movement from the subject or camera. Subtitles are overlaid near the lower center, and black bars at the top and bottom create a letterboxed effect."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
