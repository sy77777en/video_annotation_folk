  "merged_caption": "A pink hand holds a large pink phone, occupying the bottom right of the frame from a first-person perspective. The scene features a black-and-white checkered floor, with a globe in two shades of blue on a yellow stand to the left. Various geometric shapes are positioned further back. On the phone's screen, a green, multi-eyed creature is visible, with one of its tentacles extending to draw on a piece of paper in the bottom right of the screen. The animated shot features a smooth zoom-out, starting on a close-up of the smartphone and pulling back to reveal more of the surreal, checkered environment. On the screen of the pink device, the green, brain-like creature's tentacle moves a pencil, drawing a diagram on a piece of paper. The creature's other tentacles writhe quickly, and its three large yellow eyes bounce up and down. The hand holding the device and the surrounding surreal environment remain stationary. The phone's interface shows a status bar with several icons and a line of stylized, unreadable text. The entire scene is set against a black-and-white checkered floor, populated with other colorful, abstract objects, including a globe composed of two shades of blue on a yellow stand. The device's screen displays an image of a large, green, brain-like creature with three large, yellow, pupil-less eyes, and numerous writhing tentacles. One of the creature's long, snake-like tentacles holds a yellow pencil with a red eraser and is shown drawing a diagram on a pink piece of paper that rests on a red desk. The drawing itself consists of black lines, circles, and a human figure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
