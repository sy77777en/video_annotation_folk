  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a skyscape, where a massive cumulonimbus cloud, also known as a thunderhead, is the primary element. The cloud's bright, anvil-shaped top occupies the upper-center and upper-left of the frame, while its darker, shadowed base extends across the bottom of the frame. The deep blue sky serves as the background, visible in the top-right and right portions of the frame. A thin, dark silhouette of the horizon is positioned along the very bottom edge of the shot. In this time-lapse sequence, the cloud formation slowly expands, with its anvil top spreading horizontally across the upper frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the towering cloud high in the sky. This is a static, low-angle time-lapse video played at a greatly accelerated speed. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the clouds sharp. The camera's height cannot be determined. The composition focuses on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than a distinct subject. The upper, flattened portion of the cloud is a brilliant white, illuminated by sunlight, while the base is a dark, shadowy gray. Throughout the sequence, the cloud slowly evolves and expands, its top spreading wider. The entire formation is set against a deep blue sky.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal cumulonimbus cloud. The composition focuses on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than a distinct subject. This massive cloud formation, characteristic of a thunderhead, features a flattened, anvil-shaped top that is brilliantly white where it catches the sunlight, contrasting sharply with its dark, shadowed base and the deep blue of the surrounding sky.",
    "Motion": "This video is a time-lapse of a massive cumulonimbus cloud, also known as a thunderhead. The top of the cloud is brilliantly lit by the sun, contrasting with its dark, shadowy base. The entire formation is set against a deep blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a massive, anvil-shaped cumulonimbus cloud against a deep blue sky.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
