  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, the camera positioned at the subject's level. A light-skinned woman with her blonde hair tied back, wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit, stands on a light blue diving board in the foreground. In the background, several judges, dressed in dark suits over light-colored shirts with ties and wearing light-colored face masks, are seated on high chairs on the left side of the frame. The background consists of grey tiered spectator stands, partially filled with an audience of men and women in varied casual clothing and face masks, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The bright blue swimming pool is in the middle ground at the bottom. The scene takes place in an indoor aquatic center during a diving competition, marked by \"TOKYO 2020\" signage and the Olympic rings. The camera, initially at a level angle, tilts slightly up and zooms in to track the woman as she bends at the waist on the springboard, then springs upwards and forwards. In mid-air, she tucks her body, rotating multiple times before straightening. As she performs her dive, moving upwards from the board and then arcing downwards, the camera slightly pans left and tilts down, transitioning to a full shot from an above-subject perspective, changing to a high angle. The camera uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp, and the movement is smooth. The diver enters the water hands-first in the bottom-center of the frame, with the splash occurring in the middle ground as the pool surface comes to dominate the view. The sequence captures the movement from one of the diving boards into the pool, concluding with a visible splash in the water.",

    "Camera": "This is a slow-motion video. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, initially at a level angle. It tilts slightly up and zooms in to track the person as they jump from the diving board. As the person dives into the water, the camera slightly pans left and tilts down, changing to a high angle. The camera uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp, and the movement is smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video primarily features a light-skinned woman with her blonde hair tied back, wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit, as she performs a dive from a springboard into a pool. She bends at the waist, springs off the board, tucks her body during the aerial rotation, and enters the water. Observing the dive are several men, positioned on high chairs beside the pool; they are dressed in dark suits over light-colored shirts with ties, and all wear light-colored face masks. In the background, an audience of men and women, wearing varied casual clothing and face masks, is seated in tiered stands watching the event.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place in an indoor aquatic center during a diving competition, marked by \"TOKYO 2020\" signage and the Olympic rings. The scene begins with the bright blue swimming pool visible at the bottom of the frame, becoming more prominent as the camera tilts downward. Multiple light blue, flexible diving boards are positioned above the pool. In the background, grey tiered spectator stands are partially occupied by people, many wearing face masks. The sequence captures movement from one of the diving boards into the pool, concluding with a visible splash in the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
