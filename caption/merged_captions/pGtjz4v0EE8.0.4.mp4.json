  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot of a lavishly decorated, multi-tiered opera house interior, Teatro La Fenice in Venice. Initially, an ornate royal box, framed by elaborate gold statuary and featuring a deep red, draped curtain, is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. It is flanked by curved, gilded balconies that extend from the middle ground to the background on the left and right sides. The architecture is overwhelmingly opulent, with every surface covered in gilded carvings, scrollwork, and decorative moldings. The fronts of the tiered boxes are adorned with green panels and small, circular paintings depicting portraits and cherubs. The scene is dominated by a warm, golden glow from numerous electric candelabra-style lights that line the curved balconies. The camera then executes a slow arc to the right, keeping the central theater box centered in the frame, enhancing the viewer's appreciation of the ornate balconies and intricate details. Despite this movement, the royal box remains in the center of the frame, while the balconies on the right side move to occupy the center and right portions of the view. The low-angle perspective, looking up at the opulent tiers, is maintained throughout the shot. This time-lapse video shot from a low angle features a deep focus that keeps the entire ornate theater interior sharp, capturing the magnificent atmosphere and architectural scale of the entire auditorium. There is no main subject in the video, as the shot is designed to emphasize the opulence of the environment itself rather than any single person or object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
