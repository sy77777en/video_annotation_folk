  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective in a continuous wide shot, capturing a stylized desert environment. Initially, a massive canyon wall occupies the entire left side of the frame. A sandy path with a dark green cable runs from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground. On the right, rock formations and a body of water are situated in the middle ground and foreground. The camera moves smoothly forward at eye-level along the path, maintaining a level angle and panning slightly to the right. This movement brings a wooden building on a rocky outcrop from the background into the middle ground, making it the central focus of the scene. The building features a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, with a small, square window with a blue frame visible on one of its orange-colored walls. The canyon wall remains a constant element on the left, while the rock formations and water on the right gradually exit the frame as the camera advances. The path is dotted with small, bright green, low-poly bushes, and the entire stylized landscape, from the immediate path to the distant buildings, is kept in sharp focus under a clear blue sky.",

    "Camera": "This is a first-person perspective shot from a video game, where the camera moves smoothly forward at eye-level along a path in a canyon. The camera maintains a level angle and pans slightly to the right to follow the path. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire stylized landscape, from the immediate path to the distant buildings, in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a first-person perspective moving through a stylized desert canyon. The environment is composed of large, smooth, orange-brown rock formations, some of which rise as blocky pillars from a body of still, blue water on the right. A sandy path, marked by a continuous dark green cable, runs along the base of a massive canyon wall on the left. Scattered throughout the scene are small, bright green, low-poly bushes. As the perspective advances, a building becomes the central focus. It is a wooden structure with a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, situated on a rocky outcrop. A small, square window with a blue frame is visible on one of its orange-colored walls.",
    "Motion": "The first-person perspective moves steadily forward along a sandy path within a canyon, following a dark green cable on the ground. The camera pans slightly to the right as it advances, bringing a wooden building on a rocky outcrop into closer view.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, follows a dark cable along a narrow, sandy path within a stylized desert canyon. On the left, a sheer orange rock wall rises, while on the right, jagged rock formations border a calm body of blue water that reflects the scenery. The path, dotted with small, bright green bushes, leads toward a partially constructed building with a wooden frame and a red roof, all set under a clear blue sky.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective in a continuous wide shot, capturing a stylized desert environment. Initially, a massive canyon wall occupies the entire left side of the frame. A sandy path with a dark green cable runs from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground. On the right, rock formations and a body of water are situated in the middle ground and foreground. A building is first seen in the background, to the right of the center. The camera moves forward at a steady pace, following the path. This movement brings the building from the background into the middle ground, making it the central focus of the scene. The canyon wall remains a constant element on the left, while the rock formations and water on the right gradually exit the frame as the camera advances. The camera's height is consistently at eye level, simulating a character's view."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
