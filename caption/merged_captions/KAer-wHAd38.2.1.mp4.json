  "merged_caption": "This video captures a scenic view with no main subject, filmed in an extreme wide shot from a forward-moving perspective. A light-colored road begins at the bottom of the frame and extends from the foreground to the background, creating a central vanishing point. This road is flanked on both sides by vast green rice paddies that occupy the middle ground. In the foreground and middle ground, lines of streetlight poles run along both sides of the road, with a low hedge and small trees positioned in the left foreground and middle ground. The background features green hills spanning the horizon, situated below a sky filled with large clouds. The camera is positioned at eye level, moving steadily forward and panning right to align with the straight road ahead, continuing to move forward at a steady pace. This movement causes foreground elements to move toward the left of the frame, enhancing the sense of depth against the relatively static background. The shot, mounted on a smoothly moving vehicle, begins by looking forward and slightly left across the vibrant green rice paddies. It then pans right to align with the straight road ahead, continuing to move forward at a steady pace. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with large, fluffy white clouds, and rolling hills are visible in the distance. In the background, rolling green hills and mountains sit under a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. In the distance, a few utility towers and the faint outlines of a village are visible at the base of the hills. The camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, emphasizing the expansive scale and peaceful atmosphere of the countryside.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The shot, mounted on a smoothly moving vehicle, begins by looking forward and slightly left across the vibrant green rice paddies. It then pans right to align with the straight road ahead, continuing to move forward at a steady pace.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural environment. A straight, light-colored concrete road stretches into the distance, flanked on both sides by vast, vibrant green rice paddies. The road is lined with simple, modern streetlights on both sides and small, newly planted trees on the left side. In the background, rolling green hills and mountains sit under a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the camera's steady forward movement along the road emphasizes the expansive scale and peaceful atmosphere of the countryside rather than focusing on a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This scenic video shows a paved road running through vast, green rice paddies. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with large, fluffy white clouds, and rolling hills are visible in the distance. The camera moves forward along the road, offering a peaceful view of the rural landscape.",
    "Scene": "A forward-moving view captures a straight, paved road running through a rural landscape on a bright, sunny day. On either side of the road, vast, vibrant green rice paddies extend toward a distant horizon of green hills and mountains. The sky above is a brilliant blue, filled with large, white, puffy clouds. Two lines of thin, gray metal poles, possibly for streetlights, run along both sides of the road. On the left side, a low hedge and a few small, newly planted trees are visible. In the distance, a few utility towers and the faint outlines of a village are visible at the base of the hills.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
