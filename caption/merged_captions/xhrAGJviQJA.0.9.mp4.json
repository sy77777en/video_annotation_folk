  "merged_caption": "From a level-angle perspective, the camera is mounted on the car's front fender, making the car's front wheel and fender occupy the left foreground. The primary subject is a red and white car, viewed from a level-angle perspective in front of its front wheel. The wheel has a black rim with a gold-colored center cap. The black tire is marked with a golden pattern on its sidewall, which forms a golden stripe when the tire spins rapidly. The paved road stretches from the bottom of the frame in the center and right foreground towards the background in the center. In the middle ground to background, a guardrail on the right side of the frame moves rapidly past the camera as the car drives. Beyond the guardrail, in the background on the center and right, lines of trees are visible beneath a blue sky that fills the top right of the frame. The forward motion of the car causes the road and nearby scenery to blur and appear to rush from the right side of the frame towards the center, with motion lines converging in the distance. From a smooth, minimally shaking, ground-level, locked-on position on the car's left front bumper, the camera faces backward from a level angle. It moves quickly backward, leading the car to maintain its position in the frame as the vehicle accelerates forward. As the car veers left, the camera pans slightly right. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the car and the receding background sharp. The outdoor setting is a sunlit, rural landscape with pine trees and rocky terrain bordering the road, which is lined with a guardrail. The sky is bright blue with a few white clouds. The high speed of the car creates a strong motion blur effect on the road surface and the passing guardrail.",

    "Subject": "The primary subject is a red and white car, viewed from a level-angle perspective in front of its front wheel. The wheel has a black rim with a gold-colored center cap. The black tire is marked with a golden pattern on its sidewall, which forms a golden stripe when the tire spins rapidly. The visible portion of the car's body includes a bright red front fender and a white section further back, with a red rear spoiler also in view.",
    "Motion": "From a level-angle perspective, a red and white car drives forward at high speed along a road. The front wheel spins rapidly, causing the golden pattern on its sidewall to form a continuous stripe, while the road blurs into streaks due to the fast motion, and the trees in the distance also move past quickly.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted low on the side of a vehicle, the front wheel of a red and white race car spins rapidly as it speeds along a paved road. The outdoor setting is a sunlit, rural landscape with pine trees and rocky terrain bordering the road, which is lined with a guardrail. The sky is bright blue with a few white clouds. The high speed of the car creates a strong motion blur effect on the road surface and the passing guardrail.",
    "Spatial": "From a level-angle perspective, the camera is mounted on the car's front fender, making the car's front wheel and fender occupy the left foreground. The paved road stretches from the bottom of the frame in the center and right foreground towards the background in the center. In the middle ground to background, a guardrail on the right side of the frame moves rapidly past the camera as the car drives.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
