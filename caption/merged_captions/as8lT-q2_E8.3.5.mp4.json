  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, the illuminated New York City skyline is positioned in the background, stretching across the horizontal center of the frame. The One World Trade Center is prominently visible among the densely packed, illuminated skyscrapers. In the foreground, dark vertical posts of a guardrail occupy the bottom half of the frame, while overhead streetlights appear at the top. The camera, positioned above the foreground highway, trucks right and gradually zooms in on the city skyline at night. As the camera moves, the dark silhouette of the guardrail slides across the view, creating a parallax effect against the distant and relatively stationary cityscape. The shot begins in deep focus and ends with the image becoming out of focus. In the foreground, the headlights of cars travel along the highway, moving in the opposite direction of the camera's movement, towards the left side of the frame. Meanwhile, a person is riding a motorcycle on the same highway, traveling in the same direction as the camera, towards the right side of the frame. The drone captures this nighttime view from across a body of water, with the highway running parallel to the camera's movement. The vertical posts of the guardrail and overhead streetlights pass by, enhancing the sense of lateral movement against the backdrop of the brightly lit city. The video captures a dynamic interplay of motion, with the road closer to the camera featuring the motorcycle and cars moving in opposite directions, all seen from a moving perspective through a window.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial-level, level angle view, the camera trucks right and gradually zooms in on the city skyline at night. The shot begins in deep focus and ends with the image becoming out of focus.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a nighttime view of a highway in the foreground, where a person is riding a motorcycle towards the right side of the frame, while several cars move towards the left. In the background, there is a distant, illuminated city skyline, all seen from a moving perspective through a window.",
    "Motion": "From a moving perspective, the camera moves to the right, causing the dark silhouette of a guardrail in the foreground to slide across the view. In the foreground, the headlights of cars travel along a highway, moving in the opposite direction of the camera's movement, against the backdrop of a stationary, illuminated city skyline. The road closer to the camera in the foreground features a motorcycle traveling in the same direction as the camera, towards the right side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime view of the New York City skyline from across a body of water. The distant cityscape is densely packed with illuminated skyscrapers, with the One World Trade Center prominently visible. In the foreground, the drone flies parallel to a dark highway, where vertical posts of a guardrail and overhead streetlights pass by, creating a sense of lateral movement against the backdrop of the brightly lit city.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot, the illuminated city skyline is positioned in the background, stretching across the horizontal center of the frame. In the foreground, dark vertical posts of a guardrail occupy the bottom half of the frame, while overhead streetlights appear at the top. The camera, positioned above the foreground highway, moves laterally, causing the posts and lights to drift from the right side of the frame to the left, creating a parallax effect against the distant and relatively stationary cityscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
