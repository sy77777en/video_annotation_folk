  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a single matchstick with a red, granular head on a light-colored wooden stick is positioned vertically in the center of the frame and in the foreground against a solid black background. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout, with an extremely shallow depth of field that keeps the focus sharply on the matchstick. The matchstick ignites in a bright flash of light, which briefly expands to fill the frame before subsiding into a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that is yellow-orange with a blue base, burning upwards from the centrally located match head. As the flame burns, the head of the match transforms into a black, porous, and charred mass, remaining stationary in the center foreground. The flame gradually diminishes before extinguishing, after which a thin wisp of white smoke rises vertically from the burnt, blackened head in the center of the frame before dissipating, leaving the burnt matchstick in its original central position.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field that keeps the focus sharply on the matchstick in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A close-up of a single matchstick with a red, granular head on a light-colored wooden stick is shown. The matchstick ignites in a bright flash, and its head is consumed by a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that is yellow-orange with a blue base. As the flame burns, the head transforms into a black, porous, and charred mass. The flame eventually goes out, leaving the burnt, blackened head, from which a thin wisp of white smoke briefly rises.",
    "Motion": "A single matchstick ignites in a bright flash of light. The flash quickly subsides into a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that burns upwards, consuming the match head and transforming it into a black, charred mass. The flame gradually diminishes before extinguishing, after which a thin wisp of white smoke rises from the burnt tip.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a close-up shot captures a matchstick with a red head. The match ignites in a bright flash, which then settles into a steady, orange-yellow flame with a blue base. As the flame burns, the head of the match transforms into a black, porous, charred substance. The flame eventually extinguishes, leaving the burnt tip to release a faint wisp of smoke.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up shot, a single matchstick is positioned vertically in the center of the frame and in the foreground against a black background. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout. The match ignites, and a bright flame briefly expands to fill the frame before settling into a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that burns upwards from the centrally located match head.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
