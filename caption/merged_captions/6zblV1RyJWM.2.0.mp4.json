  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot, centering on the large African elephant's head and tusks, which occupy the foreground. The elephant has textured, gray skin with visible wrinkles and large, fan-like ears. Its tusks initially point towards the bottom left and bottom right corners, with a slightly worn appearance. A blurred hillside forms the background, visible mainly in the top right and top left. The camera begins at a level angle, focusing on the elephant's face with a shallow depth of field, highlighting its small, dark eyes set beneath a prominent brow. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the elephant's upper body and shoulders. During this transition, the camera tilts down smoothly, maintaining focus on the elephant, and the elephant's head shifts slightly towards the right of the frame while remaining in the foreground. The background hillside becomes more visible across the top and right side of the frame, with the dry, hilly terrain providing a natural setting. The setting is a rugged landscape with rocky hills in the background, suggesting a savanna or similar habitat. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, natural lighting highlighting the textures and details of the elephant's skin and tusks. The surrounding vegetation is sparse, with patches of dry grass and low shrubs. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the elephant standing prominently in the foreground, providing a sense of scale and presence within the expansive landscape. The camera remains at the elephant's level throughout, ensuring a clear view of the subject, and the movement is minimal and steady, emphasizing the elephant's calm and composed demeanor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
