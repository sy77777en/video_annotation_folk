  "merged_caption": "This close-up, overhead shot centers on a light-colored, round basin filled with water, occupying most of the frame, and resting on green grass outdoors during the daytime. The video is captured from a static, bird's-eye view angle, looking directly down into the basin, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field where all elements remain sharp. In the middle ground, various colorful flowers, including pink, orange, yellow, purple, white/cream, and dark red blooms resembling roses, marigolds, clematis, and daisies, float scattered across the water's surface, initially positioned in the top left, top center, left-center, bottom right-center, bottom right, right-center, and bottom center areas, along with a single pink petal. A light-skinned human hand, wearing a ring, enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, holding a pinkish-white and pink speckled rose. It moves towards the bottom center and gently places the rose onto the water in the middle ground, then retracts slightly and exits the frame toward the bottom left. The rose drifts toward the lower left with the rippling current. A few seconds later, the hand reenters from the same direction, reaching toward a purple clematis flower located near the center-right. It gently lifts the flower floating above the water and withdraws with it, moving downward and out of the frame. The flowers drift slightly on the water throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video is captured from a static, bird's-eye view angle, looking directly down into a bowl of water filled with floating flowers. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where all elements within the bowl remain sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a light-colored, round basin filled with water, in which numerous colorful flowers are floating. These flowers include varieties in pink, orange, yellow, purple, white/cream, and dark red, resembling roses, marigolds, clematis, and daisies, scattered across the water's surface alongside a single pink petal. A light-skinned human hand, wearing a ring, appears in the video. It first gently places a white and pink speckled rose onto the water, then withdraws in the direction it came from. The rose drifts toward the lower left with the rippling current. A few seconds later, the hand reenters the frame from the lower left and picks up the purple clematis flower.",
    "Motion": "A basin filled with water contains various colorful flowers, including pink, orange, yellow, purple, and dark red blooms, along with a single pink petal. A hand appears and places a pinkish white and pink speckled rose into the water. The hand then moves away, leaving the rose to float among the other flowers. Afterwards, the hand returns and gently lifts a purple flower floating above the water and carries it out of the frame.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot shows a light-colored, round basin resting on green grass outdoors during the daytime. The basin is filled with water, upon which float several colorful flowers, including orange, pink, purple, and yellow blooms, along with a single pink petal. A hand enters the view, gently places a pinkish-white and pink speckled rose onto the water's surface, and later reaches towards a purple flower already floating among the others. The flowers drift slightly in the water throughout the video.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up, overhead shot centers on a light-colored basin filled with water, which occupies most of the frame. In the middle ground, various colorful flowers float scattered across the water's surface, initially positioned in the top left, top center, left-center, bottom right-center, bottom right, right-center, and bottom center areas. Green grass is visible in the background around the top edge of the basin. A hand enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, holding a flower. It moves towards the bottom center and places the flower onto the water in the middle ground. The hand then retracts slightly and exits the frame toward the bottom left. A few seconds later, it reenters from the same direction, reaching toward a purple flower located near the center-right. It then withdraws with the flower, moving downward and out of the frame. The flowers drift slightly on the water throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
