  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot featuring a clear, stemless wine glass about half-full with a pale, translucent blue liquid and a white-grey, crumbly food item positioned in the bottom left foreground, resting on a dark, rustic plate. In a dimly lit indoor setting, these objects are placed on a dark, reflective surface. Slightly to the right of center in the background, a tall, modern wine cabinet constructed from a golden-colored metal stands, initially blurred. This cabinet contains multiple horizontal racks holding numerous wine bottles. The camera, filmed from a hip-level, level angle, remains stationary and uses a shallow depth of field. The focus smoothly shifts from the glass and plate with snacks in the foreground to the tall, illuminated wine rack in the background. As the focus changes, the foreground objects become blurry, while the wine bottles on the rack come into sharp view, revealing the structure of the cabinet and the bottles within. The rack focus transition highlights the detailed wine rack, showcasing rows of horizontally stored wine bottles.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady shot filmed from a hip-level, level angle. The video uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on a drink and a small plate with snacks in the foreground. It then performs a rack focus, shifting the focus to the lit wine rack in the background.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up, focused view of a clear, stemless wine glass on the left, which is about half-full with a pale, translucent blue liquid. Beside the glass, resting on a dark, rustic plate, are two pieces of a white-grey, crumbly food item. The focus then smoothly shifts from these foreground objects to a tall, backlit wine cabinet in the background. This cabinet, constructed from a golden-colored metal, contains multiple horizontal racks holding numerous wine bottles, which come into sharp detail as the glass and food in the foreground become blurred.",
    "Motion": "The camera's focus smoothly shifts from a glass and a plate with grayish-white food or snacks in the foreground to a tall, illuminated wine rack in the background. As the focus changes, the foreground objects become blurry, while the wine bottles on the rack come into sharp view.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a glass containing a pale blue-green liquid rests on a dark, reflective surface. Beside the glass, two white, crumbly, block-like items are placed on a dark, textured tray. The background features a tall, modern wine rack with a gold-colored metal frame, illuminated to showcase rows of horizontally stored wine bottles. The video's focus transitions from the drink in the foreground to the detailed wine rack in the background.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot featuring a glass of light blue liquid and a white food item positioned in the bottom left foreground. In the background, a tall, golden wine cabinet stands slightly to the right of center, initially blurred. A rack focus then smoothly shifts the plane of focus from the foreground to the background. Consequently, the glass and food in the bottom left become out of focus, while the wine cabinet in the background is brought into sharp detail, revealing its structure and the bottles within. The camera remains stationary and at the level of the foreground subjects throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
