  "merged_caption": "The scene depicts a 2.5D isometric video game level that scrolls diagonally from the top right to the bottom left, showcasing gameplay from a vintage arcade game with an atypical isometric perspective. The player's vehicle is a small fighter jet with yellow wings and a pink tail, casting a distinct black shadow on the surface below, indicating its height. The jet starts in the bottom left and moves across the lower half of the screen, navigating over a patterned dark blue floor enclosed by low, gray brick walls. The camera tracks the player's spaceship from a dynamic third-person isometric perspective, scrolling steadily up and to the right to follow the game's progression. The jet moves left and right across the screen and adjusts its altitude, flying over low grey walls and under tall, blue energy barriers that periodically appear vertically on the ground. Stationary elements, including green ground turrets and red-and-white striped barrels, are positioned on the ground, while flying orange enemy aircraft enter from the top right and move diagonally toward the bottom left. The jet continuously fires projectiles, destroying stationary green ground turrets, red-and-white barrels, and flying orange enemy aircraft, all of which explode upon impact, resulting in yellow and red explosions. The environment features obstacles such as grey, rock-like formations and translucent, blue, cross-hatched energy barriers within the light grey, brick-textured corridors of a fortress. The screen includes fixed overlays: two score displays at the top left, a vertical altitude meter on the left, and a heads-up display at the bottom showing a fuel gauge, lives, an enemy counter, and a \"© SEGA 1982\" copyright notice in the lower right corner.",

    "Subject": "This video showcases gameplay from a vintage arcade game with an atypical isometric perspective. The player's vehicle is a small fighter jet with yellow wings and a pink tail, which casts a distinct black shadow on the surface below. Various enemy objects appear, including stationary green ground turrets, flying orange aircraft, and red-and-white striped barrels. The environment features obstacles such as grey, rock-like formations and translucent, blue, cross-hatched energy barriers that stand vertically within the light grey, brick-textured corridors of a fortress.",
    "Motion": "A small fighter jet navigates a fortress from an isometric perspective as the scene scrolls diagonally to simulate forward motion. The jet moves left and right across the screen and adjusts its altitude, flying over low grey walls and under tall, blue energy barriers, with its black shadow on the ground indicating its height. The jet continuously fires projectiles, destroying stationary green ground turrets, red-and-white barrels, and flying orange enemy aircraft, all of which explode upon impact.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video shows a retro arcade game level set within a walled area. The environment features a dark blue floor with a lighter blue maze-like pattern, enclosed by low, gray brick walls. Throughout the level, red and white barrels, green ground turrets, and gray debris are scattered. A small, colorful spaceship flies above the ground, shooting at targets, which results in yellow and red explosions. A blue, grid-like energy barrier periodically appears as an obstacle. The scene includes several overlays: two score displays at the top left, a vertical altitude meter on the left, and a heads-up display at the bottom showing a fuel gauge, lives, an enemy counter, and a \"© SEGA 1982\" copyright notice in the lower right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
