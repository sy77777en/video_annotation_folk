  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, where a small, abstract character with a large, flowing dark maroon cape and a tuft of light blue hair or helmet is positioned at the exact center of the 2D frame in the middle ground, falling downwards. Large, pale green, translucent square platforms are visible, all positioned in the background. Slender, reddish, organic-looking structures occupy the background, fading into a hazy, bright yellow light. As the character descends vertically towards the ground, the camera smoothly tracks from a side-view perspective, moving downward and slightly zooming out. The scene expands, revealing a dark, undulating ground in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, populated by small, silhouetted, mushroom-shaped forms. More complex, branching red structures with small nodes become prominent, particularly on the right side, extending from the middle ground into the background. As the character continues to fall, it passes by tall, slender, organic-looking structures in hues of red and pink, uniquely patterned with small, square, light grey or blue nodes interconnected by fine lines, resembling biological circuitry or stylized foliage. Upon landing, the character causes several of the mushroom-shaped forms to scatter. The character comes to rest in the bottom-center of the frame, now in the middle ground on this newly revealed lower level. The camera briefly bounces up and down, maintaining a side-view perspective throughout, capturing the vastness of the abstract landscape. The surreal, abstract landscape is bathed in a hazy, bright yellow light, with large, pale green, flat-topped platforms and numerous taller, slender structures, some of which are reddish and fade into the bright background, adding to the scene's peculiarity.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly tracks a girl from a side-view perspective. As she descends, the camera moves downward and slightly zooms out. When the girl lands, the camera briefly bounces up and down.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a diminutive, abstract character distinguished by a disproportionately large, flowing dark maroon cape and a tuft of light blue hair or a helmet, giving it an unusual, almost insectoid silhouette. This character traverses an equally atypical environment characterized by towering, slender, organic-looking structures in hues of red and pink, which are uniquely patterned with small, square, light grey or blue nodes interconnected by fine lines, resembling biological circuitry or stylized foliage. These structures are interspersed with large, pale green, translucent, square platforms that appear to float. Further adding to the scene's peculiarity, a cluster of small, dark, silhouetted, geometrically simple, mushroom-shaped forms is nestled on a dark, undulating ground, contrasting with the grand, ethereal scale of the surrounding abstract landscape.",
    "Motion": "A small, abstract character with a large, flowing dark maroon cape and a tuft of light blue hair or helmet is seen falling from the sky. The character continues to descend, passing by tall, slender, organic-looking structures in hues of red and pink, uniquely patterned with small, square, light grey or blue nodes interconnected by fine lines, resembling biological circuitry or stylized foliage. As the character falls, it approaches a cluster of small, dark, silhouetted, mushroom-shaped forms nestled on a dark, undulating ground. Upon landing, the character causes several of these mushroom-shaped forms to scatter.",
    "Scene": "A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character unfolds in a surreal, abstract landscape bathed in a hazy, bright yellow light. The scene features large, pale green, flat-topped platforms and numerous taller, slender structures, some of which are reddish and fade into the bright background. As the small, maroon character moves, the environment reveals a darker, undulating ground level with smaller, indistinct shapes and more complex, branching red structures adorned with small, square nodes connected by thin lines.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
