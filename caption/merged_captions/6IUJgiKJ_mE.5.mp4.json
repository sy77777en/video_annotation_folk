  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a rapid leftward pan across a roadside embankment in the middle ground, with a static graphic overlay positioned at the top of the frame. This overlay consists of a dark blue banner with white and yellow text, divided into sections labeled \"LEADERS,\" \"CHASE,\" and \"GC PELOTON,\" displaying race information, including \"STAGE 1\" and the distance remaining. The pan settles to reveal a wide shot of a cyclist in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a paved road. The cyclist, wearing a white short-sleeved jersey with dark side panels, black shorts, and a black helmet, pedals down the center of the road, moving away from the camera's forward-moving perspective. The road stretches from the foreground at the bottom towards the background, with trees lining both sides in the middle and background, forming a tree-lined path. The camera follows the cyclist from behind as they ride away, keeping them centered while they move further into the background. This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the cyclists and the surrounding scenery sharp. The camera initially faces backward and moves in the same direction down the road as the cyclists. It then smoothly pans to the left until it faces forward, continuing to move down the road. From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene captures a daytime road race on a two-lane asphalt road marked with a central yellow line and a white shoulder line. The camera moves rapidly along the road, showing multiple cyclists racing along the center of the lane. A blue and black graphic overlay is present at the top of the screen, displaying \"TOUR OF UTAH\" and \"STAGE 1 CEDAR CITY\" on the left, along with the distance remaining.",

    "Motion": "The camera pans rapidly to the left across a roadside embankment, then transitions to a view from behind a cyclist. The cyclist pedals down the center of a paved road, moving away from the camera's forward-moving perspective.",
    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene captures a daytime road race on a two-lane asphalt road marked with a central yellow line and a white shoulder line. The road is bordered by dense forest on both sides, forming a tree-lined path. The camera moves rapidly along the road, showing multiple cyclists racing along the center of the lane. A blue and black graphic overlay is present at the top of the screen, displaying \"TOUR OF UTAH\" and \"STAGE 1 CEDAR CITY\" on the left, along with the distance remaining. The center and right of the overlay provide race statistics for the \"LEADERS,\" \"CHASE,\" and \"PELOTON\" groups, including the number of riders and their time gaps.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
