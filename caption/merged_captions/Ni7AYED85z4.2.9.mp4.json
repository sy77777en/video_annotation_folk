  "merged_caption": "The video captures the waterfront scenery with a wide shot, focusing on the overall landscape rather than a specific subject. In the foreground, stone steps and platforms are partially submerged by water, occupying the bottom left and bottom right corners. A pillar is also visible by the shoreline in the bottom right corner in the middle ground. The choppy water extends across the center and middle ground, filling most of the frame horizontally. In the background, a distant shoreline with silhouetted buildings forms a continuous horizontal line near the top of the frame. The overcast sky and faint sun occupy the upper portion of the frame. The camera begins at hip level with a high angle, using deep focus to keep the ocean and distant shoreline sharp. It starts with a subtle forward movement toward the water, then smoothly pedestals down to ground level, maintaining a high angle and steady motion throughout. As the video progresses, the camera shifts slightly lower and more centrally, bringing the steps and waterline more prominently into the foreground while maintaining the wide view of the water and distant skyline. The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The setting features a body of choppy water bordered by stone or concrete steps and platforms, some of which are wet and darkened by moisture, with visible patches of moss or algae along the waterline. The water moves steadily against the steps, creating small waves and white foam at the edges. The overall atmosphere is cool and damp, with no overlays or additional visual elements present. The distant shoreline is lined with indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, emphasizing the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera begins at hip level with a high angle, using deep focus to keep the ocean and distant shoreline sharp. It starts with a subtle forward movement toward the water, then smoothly pedestals down to ground level, maintaining a high angle and steady motion throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video is a waterfront landscape scenery shot, capturing a wide expanse of choppy water under a hazy, overcast sky with the sun faintly visible through the clouds. The distant shoreline is lined with indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, while the foreground features stone steps and platforms partially submerged by gentle waves. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, emphasizing the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a scenic waterfront view with gentle waves lapping against stone steps and platforms. The background features a misty city skyline under a cloudy sky, with sunlight faintly visible through the haze. The camera remains focused on the tranquil water and urban silhouette.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor waterfront scene during daytime with overcast skies and diffused sunlight partially obscured by mist or fog. The setting features a body of choppy water bordered by stone or concrete steps and platforms, some of which are wet and darkened by moisture, with visible patches of moss or algae along the waterline. In the distance, the silhouettes of low-rise buildings and a few taller structures are faintly visible through the haze, forming a subdued city skyline. The water moves steadily against the steps, creating small waves and white foam at the edges. The overall atmosphere is cool and damp, with no overlays or additional visual elements present.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures the waterfront scenery with a wide shot, focusing on the overall landscape rather than a specific subject.

A pillar is also visible by the shoreline in the bottom right corner in the middle ground. The choppy water extends across the center and middle ground, filling most of the frame horizontally. In the background, a distant shoreline with silhouetted buildings forms a continuous horizontal line near the top of the frame. The overcast sky and faint sun occupy the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low height, close to the level of the steps and water, emphasizing the foreground elements. As the video progresses, the camera shifts slightly lower and more centrally, bringing the steps and waterline more prominently into the foreground while maintaining the wide view of the water and distant skyline."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
