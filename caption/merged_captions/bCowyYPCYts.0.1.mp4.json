  "merged_caption": "In a grainy, black-and-white scene, a man in a dark suit or overcoat, dark trousers, and dress shoes is positioned center-right in the frame, situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned below him, capturing a low-angle view as he appears to move upwards and forward against a background completely filled with bright, fluffy clouds. His body is angled, with his left arm outstretched toward the left side of the frame. The man's head and upper torso are obscured due to the camera angle and cloud cover, rendering his features invisible. From an aerial perspective, the camera looks up at the silhouette ascending and moving forward from a low angle. It tracks the subject from below and behind, moving smoothly forward while rolling counterclockwise, which creates a varying Dutch angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the silhouette and the clouds sharp. A static white element, possibly clouds or film damage, remains stationary in the scene, contributing to the aged, film-like quality.",

    "Subject": "In a grainy, black-and-white scene, a man is shown flying upwards and forward through a cloudy sky. He is wearing a dark suit or overcoat, dark trousers, and dress shoes. His body is angled as if in mid-air, with one arm outstretched. The man's head and upper torso are obscured due to the camera angle and cloud cover, rendering his features invisible.",
    "Motion": "The man in the black coat moves upwards and forwards through the cloudy sky.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle shot looks up into a daytime sky, presented in grainy black and white, giving it an aged, film-like quality. A dark, silhouetted figure wearing a coat is seen against a background of bright, fluffy clouds, with a static white element, possibly clouds or film damage, remaining stationary in the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man in a dark suit is positioned center-right in the frame, situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned below him, capturing a low-angle view as he appears to move upwards and forward against a background completely filled with clouds. His body is angled, with his left arm outstretched toward the left side of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
