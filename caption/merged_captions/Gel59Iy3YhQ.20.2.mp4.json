  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's height. A black silhouette of grass occupies the foreground. In the middle ground, a pixelated character resembling a knight, wearing blue armor and a helmet adorned with two large horns, sits to the left of a small campfire. The campfire burns in a clearing, casting an orange glow on the grassy ground. Several tall pine trees stand behind them, forming the background, which also includes additional pine trees on both sides. The scene is set in a dark forest at night, with the sky transitioning from dark blue to black as night falls. A game HUD is overlaid across the top of the frame, showing game statistics for 'GOLD', 'ITEM', 'LIFE', and 'BOSS' with corresponding icons and values. The video begins with a dynamic shot of the pixelated character sitting by the campfire. The camera performs a quick, smooth tilt upwards, causing the character, the fire, and the forest to move down and exit the frame from the bottom. The view then moves upward, past the treetops, to reveal a black sky filled with small, twinkling stars. The shot resolves on the starry night sky, which now fills the entire view, while the HUD remains fixed in its position at the top.",

    "Camera": "The camera performs a quick, smooth tilt upwards, shifting the view from a character resting by a campfire to the starry night sky above.",
    "Subject": "A pixelated character, resembling a knight, sits on the ground next to a small campfire. The knight wears blue armor and a helmet adorned with two large horns. The small, flickering campfire casts a yellow glow on the ground. The knight and the campfire then disappear from the bottom of the view, leaving only the dark, starry night sky visible.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a dynamic shot of a pixelated character sitting by a campfire in a forest. The camera then tilts upward, causing the character, the fire, and the forest to move down and exit the frame from the bottom, leaving only a view of the starry night sky.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a pixelated scene is set in a dark forest at night. Tall, dark pine trees are silhouetted against a deep blue and black sky. A small campfire burns in a clearing, casting an orange glow on the grassy ground where a character in armor is seated. The view then moves upward, past the treetops, to reveal a black sky filled with small, twinkling stars. A heads-up display is overlaid at the top of the screen, showing game statistics for 'GOLD', 'ITEM', 'LIFE', and 'BOSS' with corresponding icons and values.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's height. A black silhouette of grass occupies the foreground. In the middle ground, a pixelated character sits to the left of a campfire. Several tall pine trees stand behind them, forming the background, which also includes additional pine trees on both sides. The sky transitions from dark blue to black as night falls. A game HUD is overlaid across the top of the frame. The camera then performs a vertical tilt upward, causing the character, campfire, and forest to move down and disappear from the bottom of the frame. The shot resolves on the starry night sky, which now fills the entire view, while the HUD remains fixed in its position at the top."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
