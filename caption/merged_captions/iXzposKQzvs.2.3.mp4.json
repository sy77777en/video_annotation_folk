  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a light-skinned young woman with blonde hair pulled back, sitting in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a grey mat with \"USA\" printed in large white letters. She wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with an American flag patch on the right side of her chest, matching dark blue pants, and fuzzy socks designed with pink and gray color blocks. Large, white over-ear headphones rest on her head. Her feet are visible in the bottom center foreground, and a smartphone is on the mat in front of her. A black backpack with a black base and red edges on the straps is in the middle ground to her left, while a purple water bottle is in the middle ground to her right. In the background, a blue curtain hangs, with a silver metal structure visible on the right side of the frame. The camera, slightly unsteady at ground level, captures the woman with a level angle, employing deep focus to keep her feet in the foreground and the rest of her body in the middle ground, along with the background, sharp. Initially, she holds the purple water bottle and smiles at the camera. She then sets the bottle down, brings her hands together in front of her chest to form a heart shape, points to the American flag patch on her chest, and makes another heart gesture, continuing to smile. A pink towel is next to the mat on the left. The camera lacks stabilization and does not remain static, capturing the sequence of her actions in a temporally coherent manner within the indoor athletic setting featuring a bright blue carpet partially covered by the grey mat.",

    "Scene": "An indoor athletic setting features a bright blue carpet, partially covered by a grey mat with the word \"USA\" in large, white block letters. A dark blue curtain hangs in the background, and to the right, a silver metal bar structure is visible. A woman sits with a purple water bottle resting in her lap, and next to the mat on the left is a pink towel.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
