  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle wide shot, the scene is framed with a large, dark vehicle in the right foreground and tall buildings lining the left and right sides of a multi-lane city street at night, which recedes into the background. The camera moves smoothly forward at street level, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire street scene sharp. A helicopter is visible in the middle ground, tumbling downwards through the air above the street. As the camera moves forward, the helicopter descends further, crashing in the center of the street and immediately exploding in a large fireball, sending bright sparks and debris flying in all directions. The fiery explosion erupts, expanding outwards from the middle ground. By the end of the shot, the camera is closer to the action, positioning the explosion at its level in the middle ground, with road markings, including yellow double lines and the word \"ONLY\" painted in large white letters accompanied by a white left turn arrow, visible in the immediate foreground. The view is framed by towering, multi-story buildings with illuminated windows, and ornate, multi-bulb streetlights line the sidewalks, casting a warm glow on the dark asphalt road. Several vehicles are present under the glow of streetlights, including a dark-colored sedan driving on the left side of the road and yellow taxi cabs visible further down the street.",

    "Camera": "From a low, ground-level perspective, the camera moves smoothly forward down a city street at night, tilting down to a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "On a multi-lane city street at night, flanked by tall, dark buildings with illuminated windows, several vehicles are present under the glow of streetlights. A dark-colored sedan drives on the left side of the road, while other cars, including yellow taxi cabs, are visible further down the street. A large, dark vehicle, possibly a truck, is positioned in the right foreground. In the center of the street, a light-colored, possibly silver, helicopter is seen tumbling through the air. This helicopter then crashes onto the pavement, resulting in a large, fiery explosion with bright orange flames, flying sparks, and dark smoke.",
    "Motion": "A helicopter tumbles downwards through the air above a city street at night. It then crashes onto the pavement and immediately explodes in a large fireball, sending bright sparks and debris flying in all directions.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective on a wide city street at night, the view is framed by towering, multi-story buildings with illuminated windows. Ornate, multi-bulb streetlights line the sidewalks, casting a warm glow on the dark asphalt road, which is marked with yellow double lines and the word \"ONLY\" painted in large white letters, accompanied by a white left turn arrow. In the distance, a helicopter tumbles through the air above the street before crashing down, erupting in a fiery explosion of sparks and debris. Other vehicles, including a yellow taxi and a dark sedan, are positioned along the sides of the road. A portion of a large, dark vehicle is visible in the immediate right foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
