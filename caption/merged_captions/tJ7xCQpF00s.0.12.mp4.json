  "merged_caption": "This wide shot frames a man standing in the middle ground on the right, leaning against a white pillar. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt, black pants, a black beanie, and black sneakers with white stripes and red soles. His body is in profile to the camera, but his face is turned away from the viewer, watching a silver-colored subway train with bright headlights and a red digital sign positioned on the top of each cabin as it moves past him. The subway train extends from the background to the foreground, its motion-blurred form filling the left and center of the screen as it travels away down the subway tunnel. The man remains stationary, leaning against the pillar and watching the train as it moves forward towards the camera, exiting from the left foreground, creating a dynamic where the composition shifts around the static subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, moving slightly unsteadily forward down the subway platform. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the man on the platform and the departing train, in sharp view. The scene is set in a dimly lit underground subway station, with the platform made of concrete and a blue tactile strip along the edge, lined with white rectangular pillars. The environment is illuminated by a row of long fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a greenish glow. In the middleground, an escalator ascends from the platform level behind a sign that partially reads \"MADISON,\" at the location of a staircase. The camera captures the train's motion as it speeds past on the tracks, moving through the arched tunnel, while the man remains fixed in his position on the right.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot. The camera moves slightly unsteadily forward down the subway platform. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the man on the platform and the departing train, in sharp view.",
    "Subject": "A man with a tattoo on his left arm stands on a subway platform, leaning against a white pillar with his hands behind his back. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt, black pants, a black beanie, and black sneakers with white stripes and red soles. His body is in profile to the camera, but his face is turned away from the viewer, watching a silver-colored subway train with bright headlights and a red digital sign positioned on the top of each cabin as it moves past him.",
    "Motion": "A subway train moves along the tracks and passes a man who stands still on the platform. The man remains stationary, leaning against a pillar and watching the train as it travels away down the subway tunnel.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the scene is set in a dimly lit underground subway station. A silver, metallic train with bright headlights and a red digital sign blurs as it speeds past on the tracks, moving through the arched tunnel. The station platform is made of concrete with a blue tactile strip along the edge and is lined with white rectangular pillars. The environment is illuminated by a row of long fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a greenish glow. In the middleground, an escalator ascends from the platform level behind a sign that partially reads \"MADISON,\" at the location of a staircase. A man dressed in black stands on the platform, leaning against a pillar as he watches the train pass.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot frames a man standing in the middle ground on the right, leaning against a pillar. A subway train extends from the background to the foreground. Its motion-blurred form fills the left and center of the screen, passing the stationary man. An escalator is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The man remains fixed in his position on the right as the train moves forward towards the camera, exiting from the left foreground, creating a dynamic where the composition shifts around the static subject.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
