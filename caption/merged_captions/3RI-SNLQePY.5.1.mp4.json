  "merged_caption": "A character with a large, round purple head, wearing a colorful, patterned shirt and beige pants, begins in the foreground on the right and moves to the center while staying in the foreground, walking down a street. The character has green limbs, teal feet, and a strap in white, black, and purple on its head. Dark, blocky buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the middle ground to the right, a concrete wall is visible, with a green guard tower and lighter-colored buildings in the background behind it. A vibrant purple sky fills the upper background. The camera tracks the avatar from behind at hip level, starting with a low angle and transitioning to a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus. The character takes a few steps forward, then turns left and right onto another street lined with similarly styled buildings. On the right, the gate of a building is a colorful, dynamic block. As the character progresses, a purple A-frame sign with a blue pattern appears in the middle ground on the right. The scene is overlaid with static user interface elements: a status display in the top left showing \"Island XP: 206\" and \"So-Tep Items: Dirty Clothes\" with green and yellow-green bars, text \"Reactionary\" in pink in the top center, a bar across the bottom initially displaying \"Current Pill: Viagra,\" then changing to \"Current Pill: Adderall,\" and finally to \"Current Pill: THC Extract.\" A circular icon in the bottom left starts with a blue geometric shape, then changes to a yellow pencil-like object, and finally to a brown teardrop-shaped object, with a mini-map in the bottom right.",

    "Camera": "This is a third-person point-of-view shot where the camera tracks an avatar from behind at hip level as it moves through a city street. The camera angle begins low and transitions to a level angle. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp, although there are slight stutters and noticeable pauses that disrupt the fluidity of the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video features a unique character with a large, round purple head, wearing a colorful, patterned shirt with vibrant hues and beige pants. The character has green limbs and is seen from a third-person perspective, akin to a video game, with the camera following it down a street. The character's head is adorned with a strap in white, black, and purple, and it has teal feet. The setting includes urban elements like buildings with a textured, artistic appearance and a bright pink sky, adding to the surreal atmosphere. A signboard with a similar color scheme becomes visible towards the end of the video.",
    "Motion": "The character begins walking down a street with buildings featuring distorted, artistic designs on the left and a cement-colored wall on the right. Atop this wall is a green structure resembling a watchtower. The sky is a vibrant pink, contrasting with the urban environment. The character takes a few steps forward, then turns left and right onto another street lined with similarly styled buildings. On the right, the gate of a building is a colorful, dynamic block. As the character continues, a purple sign with a blue pattern becomes visible on the right.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video shows a character walking down a street in a stylized urban environment under a vibrant purple sky with white clouds. The street is flanked by dark, blocky buildings with numerous windows, some of which appear weathered. In the distance, lighter-colored buildings and a green guard tower are visible above a surrounding concrete wall. A purple A-frame sign stands on the sidewalk. The scene is presented with several overlay elements, including a dark metallic frame. A heads-up display shows \"Island XP: 206\" and \"So-Tep Items: Dirty Clothes\" in the top left, with green and yellow-green bars. In the top center, the text \"Reactionary\" is displayed in pink. At the bottom, a bar initially displays \"Current Pill: Viagra,\" then briefly changes to \"Current Pill: Adderall,\" and finally to \"Current Pill: THC Extract.\" A circular minimap is located in the bottom right corner. A circular icon in the bottom left starts with a blue geometric shape, then changes to a yellow pencil-like object, and finally to a brown teardrop-shaped object, with the text in the bottom bar and the circular icon changing simultaneously.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
