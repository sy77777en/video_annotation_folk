  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a McDonald's self-ordering kiosk screen, which occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground. On the left side of this screen, a vertical menu is positioned in the middle ground, listing categories like \"Our Menu,\" \"Highlights,\" \"McMenu,\" \"Burger,\" \"McNuggets & Fingerfood,\" \"McPlant,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Sides & Extras,\" \"Drinks,\" \"Desserts,\" and \"McCafe,\" each with a small icon. The main area of the screen, to the right of the vertical menu, displays larger menu category tiles with images and text for \"Burgers,\" \"Filet-o-Fish,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"McMenu,\" and \"Desserts,\" also in the middle ground. A white, polygonal, humanoid figure is partially visible on the right edge of the frame, in the middle ground. The text \"McDonald’s Germany\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner, in the foreground. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a consistent level angle as it moves smoothly forward and downward, revealing more of the screen and menu options. This movement shifts the focus to the lower portion of the kiosk screen, which remains in the middle ground. In this new view, the total amount \"19,97€\" appears at the bottom center of the screen. Below this, a white \"Cancel Order\" button is at the bottom center, and a yellow \"Add to your order\" button is to its right, with \"Accessible View\" text beneath the \"Add to your order\" button, all in the middle ground. The polygonal figure remains partially visible on the right edge, and the \"McDonald’s Germany\" overlay stays in the bottom left foreground. The camera concludes at the height of the bottom of the screen, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the foreground checkout screen.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, maintaining a consistent level angle as it moves smoothly forward and downward to approach the checkout screen of the McDonald's self-service kiosk, concluding at the height of the bottom of the screen. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground checkout screen.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up of a McDonald's self-ordering kiosk screen, which initially displays various menu categories as large tiles with images, including \"Burgers,\" \"Filet-o-Fish,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"McMenu,\" and \"Desserts.\" A vertical menu with smaller icons and text for categories like \"Our Menu,\" \"Highlights,\" and \"Drinks\" is visible on the left side of the screen. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward and downward, revealing content that was originally located below the kiosk screen. The total amount \"19,97€\" appears in black text at the bottom center. Below the total, a white \"Cancel Order\" button with gray text and a gray frame is on the left, and a yellow \"Add to your order\" button with black text is on the right, with smaller gray \"Accessible View\" text beneath it. Partially visible on the right edge of the video is a white, polygonal, humanoid figure facing the screen.",
    "Motion": "The video starts with a close-up of a McDonald's self-ordering kiosk screen showing various menu categories like 'Burgers,' 'Filet-o-Fish,' 'Happy Meal,' 'Double Hamburger Royale,' 'McMenu,' and 'Desserts,' each accompanied by images. The camera pans down to reveal more of the screen and menu options. As the camera continues to move, the total amount '19,97€' is displayed at the bottom center, with a 'Cancel Order' button beneath it and an 'Add to your order' button to its right. An animated human figure is partially visible on the right side of the screen. The video concludes with a focus on the total amount and order buttons, set against a grey background.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an objective POV shot of a self-service ordering kiosk screen, likely in a McDonald's restaurant. The large, white, vertical touchscreen displays a digital menu. A narrow sidebar on the left lists food categories such as \"Our Menu,\" \"Highlights,\" \"McMenu,\" \"Burger,\" \"McNuggets & Fingerfood,\" \"McPlant,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Sides & Extras,\" \"Drinks,\" \"Desserts,\" and \"McCafe,\" each accompanied by a small icon. The main area of the screen initially features larger tiles with images and text for categories like \"Burgers,\" \"Filet-o-Fish,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"McMenu,\" and \"Desserts.\" As the view shifts downwards, the bottom of the screen reveals a total price of \"19,97€\" in black text, alongside a white \"Cancel Order\" button and a yellow \"Add to your order\" button. Below these, \"Accessible View\" is written in smaller grey text. The background is blurred, suggesting a clean, modern interior with a hint of a red object. A blurry, grey, polygonal object, likely an animated human figure, is partially visible on the right side of the screen. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"McDonald’s Germany.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a self-ordering kiosk screen, which occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground.

A white, polygonal, humanoid figure is partially visible on the right edge of the frame, in the middle ground. The text \"McDonald’s Germany\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner, in the foreground. As the video progresses, the camera moves slightly forward and tilts downward.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
