  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on a winter landscape at night. In the foreground, a large bank of snow fills the bottom of the frame. A tall evergreen tree stands in the center of the frame in the middle ground, flanked by a dense forest of smaller trees that extends across the scene. The background is composed of the night sky, which occupies the upper portion of the frame. Throughout the shot, the green lights of the aurora borealis and clouds are seen moving and swirling across the sky in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the central tree and the sky. This breathtaking time-lapse video captures a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminating a starry sky, with the aurora and clouds gracefully moving across the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a low angle to look up at the trees and the celestial display. A deep focus keeps the entire landscape, from the foreground snow to the distant stars, in sharp detail. The dark sky is illuminated by the vibrant green, shifting lights of the aurora borealis, which swirl above a dense stand of snow-dusted coniferous trees. Stars are visible in the sky between the clouds and the aurora. A tall, snow-dusted evergreen tree stands prominently in the center of the frame, rising from a snowy landscape dotted with a forest of other pines. Above, the dark, star-filled sky is dramatically illuminated by the vibrant green glow of the aurora borealis, which swirls and dances in wide bands behind wispy clouds. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on capturing the breathtaking atmosphere and the majestic scale of the natural world, where the celestial light show and the serene winter landscape combine to create a powerful environmental portrait.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snow-covered forest at night. A tall, slender pine tree stands as a central focal point, its dark green needles lightly dusted with snow, anchoring the composition against a backdrop of a dense evergreen forest. The ground is covered in a thick, pristine blanket of white snow.

The dark sky is illuminated by the vibrant green, shifting lights of the aurora borealis, which swirl above a dense stand of snow-dusted coniferous trees.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
