  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an over-the-shoulder medium shot, showing the upper back of a man in the foreground left and a woman's upper back in the middle ground center, both initially out of focus, with a metal railing at the bottom middle ground. The initial focus is on several people across the background, positioned on a platform near a large cylindrical structure also in the background center; a yellow beam is visible in the background top left, and an elevator structure is in the background right. The camera is initially positioned slightly above the man and the woman, with a high angle looking down. The scene is set in a multi-level industrial or construction environment with visible scaffolding and workers in the background. The man and woman are standing on a balcony, initially looking down at the activity below. The woman, holding some papers, turns towards the man and begins to speak to him. She gestures with her hand while talking, showing a friendly and animated expression. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, starting with the background in focus, then rack focusing to the midground. The woman then turns towards the man and moves closer, and the focus shifts sharply to both of them, transitioning the shot to a medium shot of her and the man in the foreground left. Simultaneously, the camera adjusts to be at the woman's eye level, transitioning to a level angle as the camera cranes down in an arc. The focus then shifts to the woman as she turns towards the man, revealing her fair skin and a smile. She then leans in and kisses the man.",

    "Camera": "The camera angle is initially high, looking down, then transitions to a level angle as the camera cranes down in an arc. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, starting with the background in focus, then rack focusing to the midground. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video initially shows several people on an opposite balcony in the background, some wearing white hard hats and light-colored shirts, in what appears to be an industrial or construction setting. In the foreground, initially out of focus, are the upper bodies of a man and a woman viewed from behind. The man has dark hair and wears a white collared shirt with a dark strap or lanyard visible around his neck. The woman has red hair and is dressed in a gray-blue, collared, button-up shirt. The focus then shifts to the woman as she turns towards the man, revealing her fair skin and a smile. She then leans in and kisses the man.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned indoors behind a male character showing his upper body and the scene outdoors, the setting features a large, multi-level space characterized by concrete walls and exposed structural elements, including yellow beams. A metal railing surrounds the area where the man and woman are standing, likely a balcony. In the background, several people, some wearing hard hats, are gathered near a large cylindrical structure on the same level.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
