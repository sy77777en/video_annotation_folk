  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a black and brown ant is positioned in the center foreground, with its body extending into the middle ground, standing atop a large red raspberry that occupies the bottom, as well as most of the central and right portions of the frame. The ant, with a segmented body, brown head, dark eyes, brown thorax, and a dark and golden-brown abdomen, has long, thin legs and antennae visible as it orients itself on the fruit. The raspberry's surface is textured with numerous small, round drupelets. The background is a plain white surface. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using an extremely shallow depth of field to focus on the ant in the foreground. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in on the insect. The ant moves slightly as it uses its mandibles to eat the surface of the red raspberry, with its head lowered toward the fruit. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the word \"TEMPONAUT\" in a white, stylized font, while a second overlay, a black and white eye-like logo, is present in the upper right corner.",

    "Camera": "This is a full shot of an ant on a raspberry. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the ant in the foreground. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in on the insect.",
    "Subject": "In a macro view, a black and brown ant stands atop a bright red raspberry. The ant has a segmented body, with a brown head and dark eyes, a brown thorax, and a dark and golden-brown abdomen. Its long, thin legs and antennae are visible as it orients itself on the fruit. The raspberry's surface is textured with numerous small, round drupelets. The ant's head is lowered towards the surface of the raspberry.",
    "Motion": "In a macro view, a black and brown ant moves slightly as it uses its mandibles to eat the surface of a red raspberry, with its head lowered toward the fruit.",
    "Scene": "In a macro shot against a plain white background, an ant with a mix of brown and dark tones, including a golden-brown abdomen, stands on the bumpy, textured surface of a bright red raspberry. The ant is positioned towards the camera, its head lowered. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the word \"TEMPONAUT\" in a white, stylized font. A second overlay, a black and white eye-like logo, is present in the upper right corner.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a black and brown ant is positioned in the center foreground, with its body extending into the middle ground, standing atop a large red raspberry that occupies the bottom, as well as most of the central and right portions of the frame. A text overlay is located in the bottom right corner, while a logo overlay is in the top right corner. The background is a plain white surface. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
