  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of the urban landscape, capturing the full expanse of the Queensboro Bridge and its surroundings. Initially, the bridge is centered in the middle ground, but as the camera moves smoothly forward along the cable car's path, it extends from the foreground to the background, from the lower right corner to the middle left of the frame. The camera maintains a level angle and deep focus, ensuring clarity across the scene. Its intricate steel framework and beige color are prominent, with vehicles traveling steadily along it. The cable car support structures are positioned in the middle left of the frame in the middle ground, while the cables extend from the foreground to the background, reaching forward in the upper middle left of the frame. On the left side of the frame, a modern glass building occupies the foreground, partially visible, reflecting the surrounding cityscape. To the right, various buildings of different heights fill the middle ground and background, creating a dense urban environment. The East River flows beneath the bridge, occupying a small part of the lower portion of the frame, with its surface reflecting the overcast sky. The scene unfolds during the day, under an overcast sky, casting a muted light over the cityscape. Traffic moves steadily along the bridge, visible in the middle ground, while cable car lines run parallel to the bridge, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The camera is positioned at the same height as the bridge, maintaining a consistent height and providing a sweeping aerial view of the entire urban setting. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video, maintaining a steady and expansive perspective of the cityscape.",

    "Camera": "The video captures an aerial view of a bridge and urban scenery from a cable car. The camera maintains a level angle and deep focus, ensuring clarity across the scene. It moves smoothly forward along the cable car's path, emphasizing the bridge's structure with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the bridge, buildings, and skyline. The emphasis is on the scale and atmosphere of the city rather than a specific object, highlighting the architectural elements and the expanse of the cityscape.",
    "Motion": "The video opens with a cityscape featuring a prominent metal bridge surrounded by tall buildings and power lines. As the camera advances, the bridge's intricate design, including its support beams and central tower, becomes clear, along with vehicles traveling on it. The scene includes a river below and a mix of modern and older buildings, highlighting the bridge's architecture and the urban environment.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an urban setting featuring the Queensboro Bridge and the Roosevelt Island Tramway on its left, both spanning the East River in New York City. The scene unfolds during the day, under an overcast sky, casting a muted light over the cityscape. The bridge, with its intricate steel framework and beige color, connects Manhattan and Queens. Surrounding the bridge are tall buildings, both modern and older structures, creating a dense city environment. The river below reflects the gray sky, adding to the urban atmosphere. Traffic moves steadily along the bridge, while the adjacent cable car lines of the tramway add a dynamic element to the scene. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the bridge, tramway, and the city, emphasizing the architectural and infrastructural elements of this iconic location.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
