  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a Parisian street scene at night, captured in a smooth, eye-level time-lapse. The camera arcs counterclockwise around a green Art Nouveau \"Metropolitain\" metro entrance, positioned centrally in the middle ground. The focus is on the environment, with pedestrians appearing as blurred streams of motion due to the time-lapse effect, suggesting the bustling energy of the city. To the left, a building with a red-awning cafe occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, bathed in warm yellow light. An adjacent building, covered in a dense grid of sparkling white lights, is located in the center-left middle ground. On the right side of the frame, a modern glass bus shelter stands in the middle ground. Trees are visible in the center background, and a large building can be seen on the right side of the background. The wet pavement extends from the bottom foreground to the background, reflecting the myriad of colorful city lights, creating a glossy, dreamlike quality that enhances the romantic and lively ambiance of the location. The deep focus keeps the entire vibrant, rain-slicked street sharp and clear. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the name \"MATHIEU STANIC\" with the title \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" beneath it.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a vibrant, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a bustling Parisian street at night. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject; the time-lapse photography intentionally blurs the pedestrians into streams of motion, emphasizing the dynamic energy of the city itself. The scene is illuminated by the warm, golden glow of ornate buildings, one of which is covered in a dense web of white fairy lights, and the bright lights of a cafe with a prominent red awning. A classic Art Nouveau \"METROPOLITAIN\" metro entrance stands centrally, its green ironwork and glowing sign a key feature. The wet pavement reflects the myriad of colorful lights, creating a glossy, dreamlike quality that enhances the romantic and lively ambiance of the location.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
