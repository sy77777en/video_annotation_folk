  "merged_caption": "This fixed extreme wide shot captures a port scene from a level perspective on a container ship at the Port of Savannah, Georgia, on a rainy, overcast day. The tops of shipping containers occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while raindrops are scattered across the entire lens, also in the foreground. A large gantry crane, marked with \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39\" in black lettering, is positioned in the middle ground, dominating the center and upper half of the frame. To the left, a wide, murky river extends from the middle ground into the background. On the right, the dock area with additional cranes and containers fills the middle ground and background. The upper half of the background features a gloomy sky. The video is a greatly accelerated time-lapse filmed from a static, overhead, and level-angle perspective, exhibiting mild barrel distortion and slight camera shakiness, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static shot. Two massive ship-to-shore cranes in the center of the frame move to different positions and then return to their original spots in a brief time-lapse sequence. The vessel is laden with colorful shipping containers, and the scene is set on a rainy, overcast day, with water droplets on the lens partially obscuring the industrial port and waterway in the background. The entire view is seen through a lens covered in water droplets from the rain. Watermark overlays reading \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" are present in the lower right-center of the scene. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the maritime shipping operation and the industrial environment rather than focusing on a specific object or action.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video filmed from a static, overhead, and level-angle perspective. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, slight camera shakiness, and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire port scene sharp and in focus.",
    "Subject": "This video captures an industrial scene shot from a level angle with a slight upward tilt aboard a container ship docked at a port. The view looks out over stacks of multicolored shipping containers on the ship's deck towards a massive white ship-to-shore crane, labeled \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39,\" which dominates the frame. In the background, a wide river and the sprawling port with more cranes and container stacks are visible under a grey, overcast sky. The scene is captured through a lens spattered with raindrops, adding to the gloomy, wet atmosphere. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the maritime shipping operation and the industrial environment rather than focusing on a specific object or action.",

    "Scene": "From a high vantage point aboard a container ship, the scene captures a view of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, on a rainy, overcast day. The perspective looks forward over the tops of stacked shipping containers on the ship's deck. A massive white gantry crane, marked with \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39\" in black lettering, looms directly overhead. To the left is a wide, murky river, and to the right, the dock is filled with numerous stacks of colorful shipping containers under a gray sky. The entire view is seen through a lens covered in water droplets from the rain. Watermark overlays reading \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" are present in the lower right-center of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
