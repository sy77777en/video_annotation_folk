  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a medium full shot of three figures arranged symmetrically in the foreground. A central male figure, rendered in a solid, bright red, stands with his hands behind his back, wearing a long coat and a matching cap. He occupies the center of the frame, flanked by two identical male figures on the left and right, depicted as soldiers in military-style uniforms with caps, holding rifles. These two figures are rendered in a reddish-brown color and have a distinct, intricate mesh-like texture. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, maintains a smooth, eye-level perspective and a level angle on the three figures, with a deep focus keeping all subjects sharp against the dark, undefined space with a non-reflective floor and a black background. The scene features a slow dolly-out, with the camera moving backward from the central arrangement, transitioning the shot into a full shot where the figures appear smaller within the frame while maintaining their respective positions. Throughout the video, the three figures remain completely motionless. An overlay of white text \"[9]\" is present in the bottom left of the frame.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a smooth, eye-level perspective, the camera maintains a level angle on the three figures. The focus appears to be deep, keeping all subjects sharp against the dark background. The camera performs a slow, minor dolly-out, moving backward from the central arrangement.",
    "Subject": "A central male figure, rendered in a solid, bright red, stands with his hands behind his back, wearing a long coat and a matching cap. Flanking him on either side are two identical male figures in military-style uniforms, complete with caps. These two figures, who are holding rifles, are rendered in a reddish-brown color and have a distinct, intricate mesh-like texture. They stand at attention, creating a symmetrical composition around the central red figure.",
    "Motion": "The three figures, one central and two flanking, remain completely motionless throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space with a non-reflective floor, three stylized figures stand in a row against a black background. The two outer figures are identical, rendered in a reddish-brown, mesh-like texture, and depicted as soldiers in uniform holding rifles. Positioned between them is a central figure, distinguished by a solid, bright red color and a long coat, though it shares a similar mesh texture. The scene features a slow dolly-out, with the camera moving backward from the central arrangement. An overlay of white text \"[9]\" is present in the bottom left of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "This video begins with a medium full shot of three figures arranged symmetrically in the foreground. A central figure occupies the center of the frame, flanked by two identical figures on the left and right. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly dollies out, transitioning the shot into a full shot where the figures appear smaller within the frame while maintaining their respective positions."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
