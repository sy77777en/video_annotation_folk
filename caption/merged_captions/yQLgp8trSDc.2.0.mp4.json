  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man of East Asian descent with black hair styled back and a thin mustache, positioned slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. He wears a dark blue, long-sleeved tunic and stands in a martial arts stance with an intense and focused expression. In the background, a vertical wooden plaque with a gold border and prominent gold Chinese characters is visible near the center, and a large circular object, representing a Taiji Bagua diagram, is on the far left. The scene is set within a dimly lit space with dark, textured walls, resembling a training hall or courtyard. The floor appears to be a smooth, grey surface. The camera, from an eye-level angle, performs a quick, smooth zoom-in on the man in the foreground. As it zooms, the focus transitions to a shallow depth of field, keeping the man sharp while the background becomes less distinct. During this zoom, the man, in a low martial arts stance, brings his hands up into a defensive position and extends his left hand forward toward the viewer in a steady and powerful gesture. The shot then rapidly transitions to a medium close-up, centering the man in the frame. In the final composition, the plaque is now in the background on the left. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subject's level.",

    "Subject": "A man of East Asian descent with black hair styled back and a thin mustache is shown in a martial arts stance. He wears a dark blue, long-sleeved tunic. His expression is intense and focused as he holds his hands up in a preparatory or defensive pose.",
    "Motion": "A man in a low martial arts stance brings his hands up into a defensive position. As the camera zooms in on his face, he extends his left hand forward toward the viewer in a steady and powerful gesture.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit space with dark, textured walls, resembling a training hall or courtyard. In the background, a vertical wooden plaque with a gold border and prominent gold Chinese characters is mounted on a pillar. To the left, a large circular object with both light and dark elements, representing a Taiji Bagua diagram, is partially visible. The floor appears to be a smooth, grey surface. A man in a dark tunic occupies the central area of this space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
