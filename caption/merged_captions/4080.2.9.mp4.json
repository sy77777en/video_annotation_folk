  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot captures a person with short, black hair featuring a light blue streak above their left eye, and a fair complexion. They are wearing dark eye makeup, which accentuates their eyes, and a red shirt or sweater with black stripes, though it is slightly out of focus. The person's face, with lips slightly parted, is tilted and nearly fills the entire frame, with a softly blurred background visible at the left edge and upper left corner. The camera is positioned above the subject, maintaining a fixed position with a subtle, unsteady motion as the subject looks up. From this high-angle perspective, the person's head tilts slightly to their right as they look upward toward the camera. As their head moves, the focus of the shot sharpens, bringing their face into a clearer view. The lighting highlights their facial features, creating a clear and focused view of their face. The scene is dimly lit, with a prominent blueish hue casting a cool tone over the subject and the indistinct, blurry background. The overall shot has a soft-focus and slightly hazy quality, with subtle motion blur suggesting movement. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, featuring an ultra-shallow depth of field, and with the subject in constant motion, the focus plane is difficult to determine.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, eye-level perspective, the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady. The shot features an ultra-shallow depth of field, and with the subject in constant motion, the focus plane is difficult to determine.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person with short, black hair that includes a light blue streak above their left eye. They have a fair complexion and are wearing dark eye makeup, which accentuates their eyes. The camera is positioned above them, capturing a high-angle view as they look upwards to meet the camera's gaze. Their lips are slightly parted, and they are positioned closely to the camera, filling most of the view. The person appears to be wearing a red shirt or sweater with black stripes, although it is slightly out of focus and difficult to clearly identify. The lighting highlights their facial features, creating a clear and focused view of their face.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle perspective, the person's head tilts slightly to their right as they look upward toward the camera. As their head moves, the focus of the shot sharpens, bringing their face into a clearer view.",
    "Scene": "A close-up shot focuses on a person with dark hair and pale skin, featuring a tuft of blue hair above their left eye. They are wearing heavy, dark makeup. The scene is dimly lit, with a prominent blueish hue casting a cool tone over the subject and the indistinct, blurry background. The overall shot has a soft-focus and slightly hazy quality, with subtle motion blur suggesting movement.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot captures a person's face, which is tilted and nearly fills the entire frame, with a softly blurred background visible at the left edge and upper left corner. The camera is positioned above the subject, maintaining a fixed position with a subtle, unsteady motion as the subject looks up. The focus on the subject's face sharpens slightly during the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
