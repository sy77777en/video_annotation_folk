  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot taken from above, a small, green plant seedling in a plastic pot is centered in the frame and occupies the middle ground. The pot, filled with dark soil, changes color with lighting conditions, appearing bright purple under focused light and pink under natural light. The plant, set inside a light-colored wooden box, features a single, upright green stem topped by two large, heart-shaped cotyledon leaves with a distinct mottled pattern of light and dark green. Emerging from the center, between the two larger leaves, is a smaller, new true leaf with a slightly serrated edge. The base of the box is positioned at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, serving as the support surface for the potted plant, while the walls of the box form the background. The composition is flanked by static vertical green bars on the left and right sides of the frame, which gradually darken from olive green to a deep dark green. In a time-lapse sequence, the plant's two large leaves subtly shift their position and orientation, while the new, smaller leaf grows upward from the center of the plant. The video showcases the plant seedling captured in a series of still shots, with the camera remaining fixed, maintaining a consistent angle and zoom throughout. The plant exhibits a swaying growth pattern, enhanced by time-lapse photography. The lighting alternates between a direct, focused spotlight from above and a more diffuse, ambient light, highlighting the plant's development. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp, as the camera is positioned inside the wooden box and remains completely still.",

    "Scene": "In a time-lapse sequence, a small plant seedling is shown inside a light-colored wooden box, with lighting alternating between a focused spotlight from above and natural light. This causes the plant's pot to appear purple under the spotlight and pink under natural light. The plant, potted in dark soil, has a green stem and two large, heart-shaped leaves with a mottled light and dark green pattern. As the sequence progresses, the leaves shift their position and a smaller, new leaf grows from the center of the plant. The video features an overlay of vertical bars on the left and right sides of the scene, which gradually darken from olive green to a deep dark green.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
