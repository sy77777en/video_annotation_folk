  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape on a hazy day. In the foreground, out-of-focus, tan-colored reeds are positioned at the bottom left and bottom right, framing the scene. The middle ground is dominated by a turquoise ocean, where a large, green-topped sea stack sits in the center of the frame, with smaller rock formations to its right. A cliff rises on the right side in the middle ground, featuring a dark-colored house at the top right. The ocean extends from the middle ground to the background, and the hazy sky occupies the top of the frame. The camera captures a slightly unsteady, static shot at a level angle, skillfully maintaining focus on the middle ground. The sea stacks and house on the cliff are sharp and clear, while the tall grass in the foreground is artistically blurred, thanks to the shallow depth of field. The only movement comes from the ocean waves crashing against the large rock formations and the slight sway of the out-of-focus grass in the foreground. The scene conveys a powerful and serene atmosphere, emphasizing the scale of the ocean and cliffs rather than a specific object or person. The sky above is a hazy, pale blue, adding to the dramatic view of the turquoise ocean.",

    "Camera": "The video captures a slightly unsteady, static shot at a level angle, skillfully maintaining focus on the middle ground. The sea stacks and house on the cliff are sharp and clear, while the tall grass in the foreground is artistically blurred, thanks to the shallow depth of field.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a coastal scenery shot, capturing a dramatic view of a turquoise ocean. White, foamy waves crash against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack topped with green vegetation. Perched atop a cliff on the right is a small, modern house with dark siding. The entire scene is framed through soft-focus, feathery reeds in the foreground, which adds a sense of depth. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the powerful and serene atmosphere of the natural landscape, emphasizing the scale of the ocean and cliffs rather than a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This scenic, static shot captures a coastal landscape on a hazy day. A large, green-topped sea stack sits in the turquoise ocean as waves crash around it, with a modern house visible on a cliff to the right. The only movement comes from the ocean waves and the slight sway of out-of-focus grass in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "A daytime view of a rugged coastline shows turquoise ocean water with white-capped waves crashing against large rock formations. In the center of the water is a substantial sea stack topped with green vegetation. To the right, a steep, rocky cliff rises from the sea, with a modern, dark-colored house perched at its edge. The sky above is a hazy, pale blue. In the foreground, out-of-focus blades of tan-colored grass partially frame the scene.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
