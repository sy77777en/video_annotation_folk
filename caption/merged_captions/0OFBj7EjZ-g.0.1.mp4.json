  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, capturing the expansive urban environment. Initially, the scene is set in darkness, with a large, faceted spherical structure dominating the foreground on the right side. Surrounding buildings and trees are faintly visible in the middle ground, creating a subdued and mysterious atmosphere. The video begins with a dark scene showing a large, polygonal structure in the foreground, with a cityscape in the background. As the camera moves, the structure gradually becomes brighter, and the text 'Berlin, Germany' appears on the screen. The lighting continues to increase, revealing more details of the buildings and the surrounding area. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right to keep the building centered in the frame, concluding with a quick zoom in to emphasize the building. As the video progresses, the lighting transitions to daylight, revealing more details of the city. The spherical structure gradually moves out of the frame, shifting the focus to the cityscape. The camera maintains an elevated position, looking down upon the urban area. The city fills the frame, with buildings spread across the middle ground and background. Modern and classical architecture is evident, with some buildings in the central area featuring diverse colors, while others are white. A classical building with an arched roof is located towards the left-middle part of the frame, while prominent buildings with flat roofs and large windows are situated in the center of the middle ground. Trees line the streets, adding greenery to the dense urban layout. The camera remains consistently above the city, providing a broad overview of the area. Text reading \"Berlin, Germany\" appears discreetly in the bottom right corner, offering context without interfering with the visual composition. Overlay elements include text and icons, positioned unobtrusively in the corners, providing additional information without obstructing the view.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right to keep the building centered in the frame, concluding with a quick zoom in to emphasize the building.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the city rather than a specific object. The wide view captures the scale and layout of the urban area, highlighting the architecture and spatial arrangement, which emphasizes the collective scene rather than any individual element.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a dark scene showing a large, polygonal structure in the foreground, with a cityscape in the background. As the camera moves, the structure gradually becomes brighter, and the text 'Berlin, Germany' appears on the screen. The lighting continues to increase, revealing more details of the buildings and the surrounding area. The camera zooms in, making the buildings and structures more distinct, including a prominent building with a dome and several other buildings. As the camera focuses on the detailed layout of the buildings, the text 'Berlin, Germany' disappears from the screen.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an outdoor urban setting, transitioning from night to day. Initially, the scene is enveloped in darkness, highlighting a large, faceted spherical structure with a smooth, metallic texture. Surrounding buildings and trees are barely visible, creating a mysterious atmosphere. As the video progresses, daylight reveals a detailed cityscape with modern and classical architecture. A specific area features buildings with diverse colors, while the rest are predominantly white. Prominent buildings include flat roofs and large windows, with a mix of rectangular shapes and a classical building with an arched roof. The environment is densely packed with structures, and the streets are lined with trees. The overall color scheme shifts from dark, muted tones to bright, neutral hues. Overlay elements include text and icons, positioned unobtrusively in the corners, providing additional information without obstructing the view. The text in the bottom right corner reads \"Berlin, Germany,\" and there is overlay text \"[2]\" in the bottom left corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
