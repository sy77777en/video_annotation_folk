  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of three black goats in a dry, grassy landscape during the daytime. Initially, the first goat, larger in size with a prominent beard and a uniformly black coat, is positioned near the bottom left of the frame in the foreground, facing right and walking towards the center near a small bush. The second and third goats, also black and smaller in size, enter the frame from the left, moving side by side behind the first goat. They are positioned in the middle ground, oriented towards the right. As they follow the first goat, they transition to a single-file line, with the second goat moving to the center and the third goat slightly behind it. The scene is set in an open environment with tall, golden-brown grass and scattered green shrubs, providing a natural backdrop. The terrain is uneven, with patches of bare earth visible among the vegetation. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the goats in the grass. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness without intentional movement. The overall setting conveys a natural, open space with a focus on the interaction between the animals and their surroundings as they navigate the area.",

    "Subject": "The video features three black goats in a dry, grassy area. The first goat is relatively large in size, with a prominent beard, and stands near a small bush, facing to the right as it walks. Its coat is uniformly black. The second and third goats, also black, are smaller in size. After entering the frame side by side behind the first goat, they follow it one in front of the other and are oriented towards the right. All three goats are surrounded by tall, yellowish-brown grass, with sparse green vegetation nearby, suggesting a natural, open environment.",
    "Motion": "In a dry, grassy field with scattered green bushes, a large black goat with a prominent beard is seen walking to the right. Two smaller black goats enter the frame side by side behind the first goat and then follow it one in front of the other, also moving to the right.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a dry, grassy landscape during the daytime. The environment features tall, golden-brown grass with scattered green shrubs and small bushes. The terrain is uneven, with patches of bare earth visible among the vegetation. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather. The scene includes three black goats, which walk toward the right side of the frame among the grass and bushes, adding movement as they navigate the area. The overall setting conveys a natural, open space with a focus on the interaction between the animals and their surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
