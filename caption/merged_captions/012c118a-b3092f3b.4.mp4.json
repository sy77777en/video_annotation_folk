  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a city street at night, captured from a level-angle, forward-facing perspective from the front of a moving vehicle. The hood of the car is visible at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The road, with a central white lane divider, extends from the foreground into the background. Parked cars line both the left and right sides of the street, extending from the middle ground all the way into the background, with dark buildings behind them. As the camera moves forward, the parked cars scroll past the frame. A large \"STOP\" marking painted on the road surface moves from the middle ground to fill the foreground before eventually disappearing from the bottom of the frame as the camera stops before reaching the intersection. Streetlights are positioned in the middle ground and background, illuminating the scene. From a slightly shaky, eye-level dashcam perspective, the camera moves forward down a street at night, maintaining a level angle. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus due to a large depth of field. As the car approaches a stop sign, the camera captures the vehicle decelerating towards the right front before coming to a complete stop. The street is lined with parked cars and illuminated by streetlights and lights from nearby buildings. Another car approaches from the left side of the intersection, also slowing down and possibly stopping at the intersection. The focus is on the overall environment and the atmosphere of the nocturnal drive, rather than on any specific object. The scene is defined by the dark surroundings, the reflections on the car's hood, and the painted \"STOP\" marking on the asphalt, all contributing to the ambient urban setting. Buildings with scattered lit windows are visible on either side of the street.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scenery from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a city street at night. The focus is on the overall environment and the atmosphere of the nocturnal drive, rather than on any specific object. The camera moves through an intersection, navigating between two rows of parked vehicles on either side of the street, under the glow of streetlights, creating a sense of place and experience. The scene is defined by the dark surroundings, the reflections on the car's hood, and the painted \"STOP\" marking on the asphalt, all contributing to the ambient urban setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view video from a vehicle driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with parked cars and illuminated by streetlights and lights from nearby buildings. The vehicle moves forward, slowing down and coming to a stop before reaching an intersection with a stop sign painted on the road. Another car approaches from the left side of the intersection, also slowing down and possibly stopping at the intersection.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive down a dark city street at night. The paved, two-lane road is illuminated by the glow of overhead streetlights, with cars parked along both curbs. As the vehicle approaches an intersection marked with white lines and the word 'STOP' painted in large letters on the asphalt, it comes to a stop. Buildings with scattered lit windows are visible on either side of the street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
