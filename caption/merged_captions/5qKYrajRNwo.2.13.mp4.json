  "merged_caption": "In an overhead POV, eye-level close-up shot, a pair of light-skinned hands occupies the bottom center foreground, holding a small, red fabric pouch tied with a yellow string over an open, rustic wooden drawer that fills the frame. The drawer frame has mottled blue and white on the edges, resembling paint. Inside, it contains various personal items, including a wooden-framed photograph of two men with exaggerated, caricature-like features in the top center, folded cloths in shades of green, gray, and gold to the right and left, a dark green wallet in the bottom left, and a round, yellow-lidded container in the top left. The hands remain in the bottom center foreground as they untie the string on the pouch, unfold it, and reveal a round, gold-colored pocket watch with a white face and black hands. The left hand places the red cloth bag on the drawer frame, while the right hand lifts the pocket watch slightly upward, positioned slightly above the front of the drawer, directly above the stationary contents of the drawer. This is a stop-motion video filmed from a static, high, eye-level angle, with the camera looking down into the drawer, using a shallow depth of field that keeps the hands and the red pouch in the foreground in sharp focus.",

The hands untie the string and unfold the pouch, revealing a round, gold-colored pocket watch with a white face and black hands. The watch is then lifted from the pouch. The wooden drawer below contains a collection of personal items, including a wooden-framed photograph of two men with exaggerated, caricature-like features, several folded pieces of cloth, a dark green wallet, and a round, yellow-lidded container. The edge frames of the drawers are painted with a mix of colors, including blue, white, and yellow.",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands unties the string on a small red pouch held over an open drawer. After unfolding the pouch to reveal a gold pocket watch, the left hand places the red cloth bag on the drawer frame, while the right hand holds up the pocket watch.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective looks down into an open, rustic wooden drawer. The drawer frame has mottled blue and white on the edges, resembling paint. Inside, it contains various items, including several folded cloths in shades of green, gray, and gold, a dark green wallet, and a round yellow lid. A small, wood-framed photograph of three figures is located slightly above the middle of the drawer, against the back. A pair of hands holds a small, red, velvety pouch, unties its yellow string, and reveals a gold-colored pocket watch with a white face.",
    "Spatial": "In an overhead POV, eye-level close-up shot, a pair of hands occupies the bottom center foreground, holding a red pouch over an open drawer that fills the frame. In the middle ground below, the drawer's contents are arranged with a framed photograph in the top center, folded cloths to the right and left, a wallet in the bottom left, and a lidded container in the top left. The hands remain in the bottom center foreground as they open the pouch, revealing a gold pocket watch.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
