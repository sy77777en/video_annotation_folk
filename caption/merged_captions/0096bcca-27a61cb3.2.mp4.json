  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a vehicle's perspective, using a slightly unsteady, eye-level dashcam. Initially, a brightly lit Gulf gas station occupies the background from the center to the right of the frame, with its tall sign in the top left. A light-colored minivan is positioned in the middle ground on the bottom left. The scene begins at an intersection, where the car makes a U-turn to the left, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. As the camera moves forward and pans left, the gas station and minivan exit the frame to the right. An intersection with crosswalks enters the foreground, while a city bus appears in the middle ground on the left and a multi-story building is visible in the background. The camera continues forward through the intersection, causing the buildings and bus to exit the frame to the right as the car turns and the camera pans left. The view then shifts to the road ahead, with streetlights and distant storefronts lining the sides of the frame in the middle ground and background. The scene is illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the glowing signs of businesses, conveying the atmosphere and scale of the city at night. The camera is positioned at a height consistent with a vehicle's dashboard, capturing the dynamics of the nighttime drive as the car proceeds down a city street, passing other vehicles, storefronts, and streetlights. The focus is on presenting a broad view of the urban environment rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",

    "Camera": "From a slightly unsteady, eye-level dashcam perspective, the camera captures a car making a U-turn to the left at an intersection. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a city intersection at night. The scene is illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the glowing signs of businesses, including a prominent Gulf gas station and various storefronts, with a few cars and a city bus visible at the intersection. The video lacks a main subject as the camera continuously pans and moves forward, presenting a broad view of the urban environment. The focus is on conveying the atmosphere and scale of the city at night rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a nighttime drive from the perspective of a car's dashboard camera. The scene begins at an intersection with a brightly lit Gulf gas station. The car then turns and proceeds down a city street, passing other vehicles, storefronts, and streetlights.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive through an urban area at night. The scene begins with a brightly lit Gulf gas station, its tall sign displaying the orange and blue logo, before the vehicle proceeds through an intersection. The streets are marked with white crosswalks and are illuminated by streetlights and the glow from storefronts. Other vehicles, such as a light-colored minivan, an SUV, and a city bus, are present on the road. The camera pans left, revealing more multi-story buildings and traffic lights as the car continues its journey through the city.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
