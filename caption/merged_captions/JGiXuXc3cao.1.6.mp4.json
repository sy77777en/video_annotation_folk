  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an animated man, Robert Ballard, positioned in the right foreground against a background of a vast, calm, blue-green ocean stretching to the horizon under a light blue sky with soft, white clouds. He is identified by on-screen text as \"ROBERT BALLARD\" and \"MARINE GEOLOGIST.\" The animated illustration depicts him as a white man with short, light-colored hair, smiling and looking forward. He wears a blue, short-sleeved collared shirt with two patches: a circular one on the right chest with a red and blue design featuring a ship, and another on the left chest with a blue design on a white background. He also wears a blue baseball cap with a white logo of a mountain, and a watch with a black band is visible on his right wrist. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, zooming out slightly to reveal more of his torso. As this happens, white text appears on the left, identifying the subject. The camera smoothly zooms out from the animated illustration of Robert Ballard, and as it zooms, it also rolls clockwise, correcting from an initial Dutch angle to a level horizon. The animated illustration of Robert Ballard remains stationary with his arms crossed as text identifying him as \"ROBERT BALLARD\" and \"MARINE GEOLOGIST\" appears on the left side of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
