  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man and a woman in the middle ground, dancing closely and kissing. The woman has long, straight, light-brown hair and is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless top, while the man has a large, curly, blonde perm and is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket with a white corsage on the lapel over a light-colored shirt. They are locked in a close embrace, with the woman's left arm resting on the man's shoulder and her right hand firmly gripping the man's left hand, holding it close to his chest. The couple slowly rotates clockwise in the center of the frame, and the camera, from a low, hip-level angle, arcs counterclockwise around them, keeping them as the central focus while the perspective on them shifts. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space during a nighttime celebration, characterized by soft, colorful lighting with prominent hues of purple, red, and green creating a hazy ambiance. Above them, at the top of the frame, hang shiny, star-shaped decorations and strings of festive lights, which produce a noticeable bokeh effect. The background is dark and indistinct, with out-of-focus lights appearing sequentially in red, purple, and green, maintaining the focus on the couple beneath the decorations. The slightly unsteady camera captures the intimate posture of the couple throughout the scene, emphasizing their slow, continuous, clockwise motion on the spot, while the shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the couple in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space during a nighttime celebration. The environment is characterized by soft, colorful lighting, with prominent hues of purple, red, and green creating a hazy ambiance. Hanging from the ceiling are shiny, star-shaped decorations and strings of festive lights, which produce a noticeable bokeh effect. The background is dark and indistinct, keeping the focus on the central area where a couple is dancing closely beneath the decorations.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
