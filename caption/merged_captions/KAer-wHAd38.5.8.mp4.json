  "merged_caption": "The video captures a sunlit neighborhood street from the first-person perspective of a motorbike rider. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. It moves forward along the paved road, which runs from the bottom center foreground to the center background, creating a strong sense of depth. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, capturing the road ahead lined with houses, greenery, and signage under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. Residential and commercial buildings line both sides of the street, extending from the foreground to the background, featuring white or green facades and tiled roofs. Lush green trees and bushes frame the scene, occupying the left, right, and top edges in the middle ground and background, casting patches of shade on the ground. Utility poles and wires cross the upper part of the frame, mostly in the background and top center, while flags on poles are visible along the roadside, mainly in the middle ground on the right. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, occupies the top background. The dynamic view includes other motorbike riders either approaching or moving away, enhancing the immersive experience of the street's environment and spatial layout. The scene captures the presence of other figures and vehicles visible farther in the distance, contributing to the peaceful and inviting atmosphere. The overall environment is calm, with sunlight highlighting the vibrant greenery and the clean, well-maintained appearance of the area. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere, vibrant greenery, and the spaciousness of the street rather than any specific object or individual, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
