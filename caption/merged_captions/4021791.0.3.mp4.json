  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring a person wearing a blue, white, and red helmet, a black chest protector with a colorful graffiti pattern on the back over a red and black long-sleeved jersey, red and black pants, and black boots, riding an orange and white dirt bike with a black seat. The rider, also wearing black gloves, is in the center of the frame and the middle ground, navigating a grassy, uneven hillside during the daytime. The ground is covered with a mix of dry, light brown grass and patches of green, with scattered rocks. A dense wall of vibrant green bushes and small trees occupies the top of the frame in the background, with some taller, bare tree branches visible against a pale, overcast sky. The camera is at a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field, initially zooming in. As the rider moves forward, maintaining a steady posture, they approach a small jump. The bike lifts off the ground, with the front wheel elevated, as the rider controls the throttle. After landing, the rider maintains balance and continues forward through the grassy and rocky terrain, adjusting their position slightly by leaning forward. The camera pans right to side-track the motorcyclist as they ride to the right, with noticeable shaking. As the rider moves from the center towards the right of the frame, navigating the uneven terrain, the shot transitions to a wide shot, and the camera's perspective changes to below the subject, who remains in the middle ground. The rider maintains a steady pace, navigating through the landscape, and then changes direction, making a slight turn to the right.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at a level angle and uses a deep focus with a large depth of field. It initially zooms in, then pans right to side-track the motorcyclist as they ride to the right. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "A person, wearing a blue, white, and red helmet, a black chest protector featuring a colorful graffiti pattern on the back over a red and black long-sleeved jersey, red and black pants, and black boots, rides an orange and white dirt bike with a black seat. The rider, also wearing black gloves, is seen from the back and side as they navigate uneven, grassy terrain.",
    "Motion": "The rider starts by moving forward on the dirt bike, maintaining a steady posture as they approach a small jump. The bike lifts off the ground, with the front wheel elevated, as the rider continues to control the throttle. After landing, the rider maintains balance and continues to move forward through the grassy and rocky terrain. The rider adjusts their position slightly, leaning forward as they navigate the uneven ground. The rider maintains a steady pace, navigating through the grassy and rocky landscape.

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a grassy, uneven hillside during the daytime. The ground is covered with a mix of dry, light brown grass and patches of green, with a few scattered rocks. In the background, a dense thicket of vibrant green bushes and small trees forms a solid wall of foliage, with some taller, bare tree branches visible against a pale, overcast sky. A dirt bike rider navigates the terrain, moving across the slope.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring the rider and dirt bike in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The grassy terrain is visible at the bottom of the frame, spanning the foreground and middle ground, while a dense wall of green bushes and trees occupies the top of the frame in the background, with a pale sky above. The camera is initially at the subject's level. As the rider moves from the center towards the right of the frame, navigating the uneven terrain, the shot transitions to a wide shot, and the camera's perspective changes to below the subject, who remains in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
