  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the Place Vendôme in Paris at night, focusing on the architectural scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, a tall, illuminated Vendôme Column is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. It is dramatically illuminated with a cool, greenish-blue light, standing in contrast to the warm, golden glow from the windows of the elegant surrounding buildings. The column, featuring spiraling relief carvings and topped with a statue, stands on a large stone pedestal. It is flanked by grand, multi-story buildings of a uniform classical design, with illuminated windows and mansard roofs that fill the background. Several ornate, multi-lamp streetlights are prominent in the foreground, casting bright, starburst-like light across the square against the dark night sky. The camera, positioned at a low, eye-level angle, uses a deep focus to keep the central column and the surrounding buildings sharp. It performs a slow, upward tilting motion, gradually emphasizing the height and grandeur of the monument against the night sky. Simultaneously, the camera executes a very smooth movement, panning to the left while moving to the right, maintaining the extreme wide shot throughout. A time-lapse effect captures the subtle changes in lighting and movement within the scene, with a few indistinct people visible on the ground level. The majestic atmosphere and architectural grandeur of the entire environment are showcased, using the column as a centerpiece to highlight the scale and beauty of the location as a whole. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER.\"",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of the Place Vendôme in Paris at night, filmed from a low, eye-level perspective.

    "Subject": "This video features a cityscape scenery shot of a grand, octagonal plaza at night, with the camera slowly zooming in. A very tall, ornate column, illuminated in a striking greenish-blue light and topped with a statue, stands as the central monument, surrounded by elegant, uniformly designed classical buildings whose windows glow with warm light. Ornate street lamps are scattered throughout the square, their bright lights creating a prominent starburst effect against the dark sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the majestic atmosphere and architectural grandeur of the entire environment, using the column as a centerpiece to showcase the scale and beauty of the location as a whole.",
    "Motion": "This is a stunning night-time shot of the Place Vendôme in Paris, with the iconic Vendôme Column as the central focus. The column is dramatically illuminated with a cool, greenish-blue light, standing in contrast to the warm, golden glow from the windows of the elegant surrounding buildings. Ornate street lamps cast bright, starburst-like light across the square.\n\nThe camera performs a slow, upward tilting motion, gradually emphasizing the height and grandeur of the monument against the dark night sky.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse shot captures the Place Vendôme in Paris at night, with the camera slowly zooming in on the central Vendôme Column. The tall, slender column, which features spiraling relief carvings, is illuminated by a greenish-blue light and topped with a statue. It stands on a large stone pedestal in the center of the square. Surrounding the square are grand, multi-story buildings of a uniform classical design, with illuminated windows and mansard roofs.

    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a city plaza at night, focusing on the architectural scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, a tall, illuminated column is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. It is flanked by large buildings that fill the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
