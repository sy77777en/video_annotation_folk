  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man standing inside a vintage train compartment with a green and white color scheme. The man, who has a mustache and is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark green vest with yellow trim, a green hat with red text, matching green pants, a tie, and a watch on his left wrist, is initially positioned in the middle ground with his upper body visible. The interior features maps and communication equipment on the walls, metallic textures with visible rivets and panels, and a prominent green board covered with numerous papers. A table cluttered with various items adds to the detailed setting. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains stationary relative to the train, positioned from the side with noticeable shaking, while the train appears to truck left throughout the shot. The man holds the telephone handset with his right hand while looking out the window. He then turns to his right to hang the telephone back up, before turning back to pull the window down, opening it. As the video progresses, he opens the window and leans forward, placing his arms on the window ledge, which brings him closer to the foreground. He looks to his right, then turns to his left, and eventually looks straight ahead. His position remains central in the frame. The lighting is consistent, indicating daytime. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's movement from a more upright stance to a leaning posture, emphasizing his interaction with the window and the surrounding environment.",

    "Motion": "In a small room with a green and white color scheme, featuring a map on the wall and a telephone mounted on the left side of the frame, the man holds the telephone handset with his right hand while looking out the window. He then turns to his right to hang the telephone back up, before turning back to pull the window down, opening it. Finally, he leans forward, resting his forearms on the lowered window frame, looks to his right, then turns to his left, and eventually looks straight ahead.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts the interior of a vintage train compartment with a green and white color scheme.

A table cluttered with various items further enriches the setting, focusing on the detailed interior and the individual within this space.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a man standing inside a train compartment. Initially, he is positioned in the middle ground, with his upper body visible. The man is seen interacting with the environment, moving his arms and hands towards the window frame. As the video progresses, he opens the window and leans forward, placing his arms on the window ledge, which brings him closer to the foreground. His position remains central in the frame. The background remains consistent, featuring a green and white interior with maps and communication equipment on the walls. The camera maintains a steady height at the subject's level throughout the sequence, capturing the man's actions and the detailed interior of the train compartment. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's movement from a more upright stance to a leaning posture, emphasizing his interaction with the window and the surrounding environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
