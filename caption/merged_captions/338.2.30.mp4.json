  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, positioned in the left side of the frame and in the foreground. She holds an ice cream cone and is seated at a table in a bustling Chinese restaurant with warm, ambient lighting and ornate, gold-colored carved wooden panels. Another woman, wearing a denim jacket, is located to the right of the frame, also in the foreground, watching her with a slight smile. The camera is at eye level with a shallow depth of field, capturing the woman licking the ice cream cone. The camera then smoothly pans left at a quick speed, transitioning the focus to a medium shot of a man in a yellow shirt, who is centered in the frame and in the middle ground. He is seated at a different table, which is set with various dishes, and is facing the camera, smiling. The background includes other diners, a decorative wall with intricate designs, and a large circular archway leading to another section of the room. A round table in the middleground is set with pink napkins, dishes, and a lazy Susan. Various patrons are seated at tables throughout the space, with a waiter in a vest visible in the background. A person with long dark hair is seated in the foreground before the camera transitions. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing both scenes from a direct perspective and maintaining a consistent viewpoint relative to the subjects. The setting is a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background. The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the two women to the man.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
