  "merged_caption": "The video, captured with a wide shot, opens with a man skateboarding in the center-left mid-ground, wearing a maroon long-sleeve shirt and black pants, riding towards the right on a light-colored paved surface. The camera, positioned at ground level with noticeable fisheye distortion, tracks the skateboarder from left to right, maintaining a level angle but with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. As he navigates a curved path across the mid-ground, the framing remains wide. The skateboarder moves parallel to the camera, gliding along the straight base of a large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument with bronze statues, prominent in the right middle ground. Leaning into his movement, he propels the skateboard into the air, causing it to rotate beneath his feet before he lands back on it and rides away from the monument. The fisheye lens distorts the perspective, making the ground and background elements appear curved and emphasizing the skater's dynamic movements. Behind the monument, a substantial brown brick building with cylindrical towers stands in the background, initially to the right and then more centrally. Additional multi-story buildings and green trees are visible in the far left and far right background, with a partly cloudy sky occupying the top background. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, though it is handheld and unsteady with noticeable shaking. Towards the end, the camera stops tracking, tilts down, and slightly pans right to capture the skateboarder moving away. The monument has \"EMANVELE FILIBERTO DVCA D'AOSTA\" inscribed on its side, and the scene is set in an outdoor urban plaza during the daytime.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at ground level, maintaining a level angle but with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It employs a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The handheld camera is unsteady with noticeable shaking as it tracks the skateboarder from left to right. Towards the end, the camera stops tracking, tilts down, and slightly pans right to capture the skateboarder moving away.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a maroon long-sleeve shirt and black pants. His hair is short and dark. The man is actively skateboarding, performing tricks and maneuvers on a paved area. His movements are dynamic, and he is oriented towards the camera at different angles throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "A skateboarder moves parallel to the camera, gliding along the straight base of a stepped monument. Leaning into his movement, he propels the skateboard into the air, causing it to rotate beneath his feet before he lands back on it and rides away from the monument. The fisheye lens distorts the perspective, making the ground and background elements appear curved and emphasizing the skater's movements.",
    "Scene": "The video, shot with a fisheye lens creating a circular, distorted perspective, captures an outdoor urban plaza during the daytime. In the mid-ground, a skateboarder moves across a light-colored, smooth paved surface. Dominating the scene is a large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument made of stone, featuring several bronze statues of figures in what appear to be historical or military attire; one prominent statue stands atop a tall pedestal. The monument has \"EMANVELE FILIBERTO DVCA D'AOSTA\" inscribed on its side. Behind this, a substantial, old, brown brick building with cylindrical towers, resembling a castle or fortress, is visible. Further in the background, other multi-story buildings with windows can be seen, along with green trees. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible between white clouds.",
    "Spatial": "The video, captured with a wide shot, opens with a skateboarder positioned in the center-left mid-ground, riding towards the right on a light-colored paved surface. As he navigates a curved path across the mid-ground, the framing remains wide. A large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument with bronze statues is prominent in the right middle ground, becoming more central as the skateboarder moves. Behind the monument, a substantial brown brick building with cylindrical towers stands in the background, initially to the right and then more centrally. Additional multi-story buildings and green trees are visible in the far left and far right background, with a partly cloudy sky occupying the top background. The camera maintains the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
