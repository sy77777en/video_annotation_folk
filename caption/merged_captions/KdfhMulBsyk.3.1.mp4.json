  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a rainy city street in London at night. Initially, a red postbox occupies the right foreground, with the wet pavement reflecting lights across the bottom of the frame. Storefronts line the left side, while a road with cars, including classic black London taxis, is on the right. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene, from the storefronts on the left to the traffic on the right, in sharp detail. The camera consistently moves steadily forward along the sidewalk throughout the entire video. As it advances, the person with an umbrella, visible in the center-left middle ground, walks towards the camera and eventually moves out of the frame. The red postbox also moves out of the frame as the camera gets closer to a bus shelter located further down the path in the center. The dark, glossy pavement reflects the bright lights from the storefronts and streetlights, creating elongated, colorful streaks on the ground. In the distance, the headlights of cars cut through the darkness. The focus remains on the overall environment and moody atmosphere, with the camera moving steadily down the sidewalk to capture the scale and ambiance of the rainy urban setting rather than highlighting a specific subject. A red telephone booth or bus shelter is visible further down the sidewalk, enhancing the iconic London cityscape. The perspective is from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving forward along the wet city sidewalk at night.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, slightly unsteady shot that moves forward along a wet city sidewalk at night. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene, from the storefronts on the left to the traffic on the right, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a London street at night during a rain shower. The wet, dark pavement glistens, creating vivid, elongated reflections of the bright lights from street lamps and closed storefronts, which line the sidewalk. In the distance, the headlights of cars, including classic black London taxis, cut through the darkness, while a traditional red postbox stands prominently in the foreground. The focus remains on the overall environment and moody atmosphere, with the camera moving steadily down the sidewalk to capture the scale and ambiance of the rainy urban setting rather than highlighting a specific subject.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a wet city street in London at night. The rain-slicked pavement reflects the bright lights from storefronts, street lamps, and passing cars. A classic red postbox stands on the sidewalk next to the road where several London taxis are visible.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the perspective moves forward along a wet city sidewalk at night. The dark, glossy pavement reflects the bright lights from the storefronts and streetlights, creating elongated, colorful streaks on the ground. The street is lined with multi-story buildings, and on the right, a bright red postbox stands on the curb next to a road with moving traffic, including black taxis. Further down the sidewalk, a red telephone booth or bus shelter is visible, and a person holding an umbrella walks away from the camera.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
