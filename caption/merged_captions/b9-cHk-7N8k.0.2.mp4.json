  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured from the subject's level, a man with reddish-brown, medium-length hair and a beard is shown surfing on a wave, positioned in the middle ground. He is wearing a black, short-sleeved wetsuit and initially maintains a low, crouched stance on a light blue surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame. His right arm is extended out to his side for balance, and his left hand touches the water's surface. A large wave curls in the middle ground on the middle left, with the sun positioned at the top center and a coastline with cliffs and vegetation visible in the background on the far left. The camera, fixed to the surfboard and positioned above the water, moves backward, leading the surfer. Its orientation creates a varying Dutch angle as it rolls with the board's motion, eventually rolling counterclockwise at the end. As the camera moves, the surfer transitions to a more upright stance while remaining in the middle ground, with his body facing left relative to the scene. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, capturing the ride on a deep blue ocean wave under a bright sun in a clear blue sky with a few white clouds. The board glides across the water, creating white spray, while the wave's face is a dark turquoise. As the perspective shifts, the surfer continues to glide across the water in a more upright surfing posture as the wave breaks behind him.",

    "Subject": "A man with reddish-brown, medium-length hair and a beard is shown surfing on a wave. He is wearing a black, short-sleeved wetsuit. Initially, he maintains a low, crouched stance on a light blue surfboard, with his right arm extended out to his side for balance and his left hand touching the water. Then, he stands up with his body facing left relative to the scene.",
    "Motion": "A surfer rides a wave in a low, crouched stance, extending his right arm for balance while his left hand touches the surface of the water. The perspective then shifts to show him continuing to glide across the water in a more upright surfing posture as the wave breaks behind him.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to the front of a light blue surfboard, captures a ride on a deep blue ocean wave. Under a bright sun in a clear blue sky with a few white clouds, the board glides across the water, creating white spray. To one side, the wave curls over, its face a dark turquoise. A person in a black wetsuit initially adopts a crouched position but then transitions to a more upright stance as they ride along the wave. In the background, a coastline with cliffs and vegetation is visible.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot captured from the subject's level, a surfer is positioned in the middle ground, initially in a crouched stance on a surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame. A large wave curls in the middle ground on the middle left, with the sun positioned at the top center and a coastline visible in the background on the far left. As the camera moves backward with the board, the surfer transitions to a more upright stance while remaining in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
