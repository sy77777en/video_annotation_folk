  "merged_caption": "This wide shot of a rural landscape is captured from a ground-level perspective, initially focusing on the middle ground before shifting to the background. The video begins with the camera at ground level, looking straight ahead, and smoothly moves forward while maintaining a level angle. Initially, the focus is on the midground, capturing details like the ground texture covered in small, glittering particles. In the middle ground, a tree stands on the far right and a railing is on the far left. A slow pull focus transitions from the middle ground to the background, gradually revealing more details of the landscape, including additional trees, a water tower in the distance, a shed, and other structures. In the background, a dark building sits on the left, a utility pole is positioned left of center, and a metal shed is located near the center. Further in the background, a water tower is visible behind the tree on the right, with distant structures and hills stretching across the horizon under the sky in the upper portion of the frame. The scene remains static, except for a few particles gently falling. The camera movement is steady and fluid throughout, with a slow rack focus shifting attention to the background, highlighting structures like the tree and buildings. The video depicts an outdoor setting at dusk, featuring a quiet, rural landscape. The scene includes a small, weathered building with a sloped roof, constructed from dark, textured material. The sky transitions from a pale gray to a desaturated orange near the horizon, indicating either sunset or sunrise. A small white text overlay, marked [10], is located in the bottom left corner without obstructing the view.",

    "Subject": "A scenic landscape shot highlighting the environment and atmosphere, featuring buildings, trees, and sky to convey the scale and ambiance of the setting.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a shallow depth of field focusing on the ground covered in small, glittering particles, creating a soft blur of the building, utility pole, and tree in the background. A slow pull focus transitions from the middle ground to the background, gradually revealing more details of the landscape, including additional trees, a water tower in the distance, a shed, and other structures. The entire scene remains static, except for a few particles gently falling.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting at dusk, featuring a quiet, rural landscape. The scene includes a small, weathered building with a sloped roof, constructed from dark, textured material. Nearby, a simple metal structure, possibly a shed, stands with a corrugated surface. A prominent tower at the center of the frame but slightly towards the right rises against the dimming sky, adding to the rustic atmosphere. The ground is covered with scattered debris, suggesting a neglected area. A single utility pole stands without wires, contributing to the rural ambiance. The sky transitions from a pale gray to a desaturated orange near the horizon, indicating either sunset or sunrise. A small white text overlay, marked [10], is located in the bottom left corner without obstructing the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
