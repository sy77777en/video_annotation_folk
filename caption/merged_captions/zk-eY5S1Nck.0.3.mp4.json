  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young, light-skinned girl with brown hair styled in two high pigtails, wearing a pink, short-sleeved shirt under blue denim overalls, positioned in the center foreground at the top of a dimly lit staircase. She stands still, looking down, focused on a white string she is holding in her hand. To the left, a white railing with vertical slats lines the edge of the landing, while a wall decorated with a gallery-style arrangement of various-sized family photos in white frames is visible in the right background. From a high, eye-level angle, the camera is initially static, with a shallow depth of field focused on the little girl. The camera then begins to arc smoothly counter-clockwise around her, and she turns her head to her left to look at a blue balloon floating at the bottom of the stairs. As the camera performs a rack focus, attention shifts to the blue balloon in the background. The framing transitions into a wide shot, with the girl now positioned on the left side of the frame, while the focus shifts to the blue balloon in the center-right background at the base of the stairs, near the decorated wall. The camera is now positioned above the balloon, looking down toward it.",

    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned girl with brown hair styled in two high pigtails stands at what appears to be the top of a staircase. She is wearing a pink, short-sleeved shirt under blue denim overalls. The girl looks down, focused on a white string she is holding in her hand. The scene then reveals a blue balloon floating a short distance away from her near the bottom of the stairs.",
    "Motion": "A young girl stands still at the top of a staircase, looking down while holding a string. A blue balloon is then shown floating at the bottom of the stairs, and the girl turns her head to her left to look at it.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors at the top of a dimly lit staircase. To the left, a white railing with vertical slats lines the edge of the landing. At the bottom of the stairs, a wall is decorated with a gallery-style arrangement of various-sized family photos in white frames. A single blue balloon floats in the corner at the base of the stairs, near the decorated wall.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young girl positioned in the center foreground, with a white railing on the left and a wall of pictures in the right background. The camera moves in a gentle counterclockwise arc around the girl, transitioning into a wide shot of a blue ballon. In this final framing, the girl is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the focus shifts to a blue balloon in the center-right background at the bottom of the stairs. The camera is now positioned above the ballon, looking down toward the balloon."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
