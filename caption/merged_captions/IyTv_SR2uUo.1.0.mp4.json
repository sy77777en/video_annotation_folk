  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a motocross rider and their bike from a locked-on POV, with the camera mounted on the rider's helmet using a helmet mounting bracket. The rider, wearing a full racing uniform with a white, red, and blue full-face helmet featuring a Red Bull logo, dark-lensed goggles, a gray and mint green jersey with \"SEVEN\" printed on it, black racing pants, red and white knee protection, and bright yellow gloves, grips the handlebars of a bright yellow and white Suzuki dirt bike marked with the number \"7\" on the front plate. The rider and the handlebars are mostly centered in the foreground throughout the clip, though the rider's body briefly shifts to the left while mid-air. The scene begins with the rider in mid-air, with a reddish-brown dirt track visible in the middle ground and background. As the rider and bike soar through the air, the camera rotates clockwise, showing more of the sky in the top left and the dirt track in the bottom right. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, with subtle barrel distortion. The slightly unsteady camera is positioned at a high, eye-level angle with a rolling Dutch angle. Using a deep focus, the camera lead-tracks the motorcycle rider, moving backward. As the rider launches into the air for a stunt, the camera moves upward and rolls to follow his acrobatics, then moves downward to track his landing. The track, made of reddish-brown dirt, features large jumps and banked curves, set against a landscape of green fields and scattered trees under a bright blue sky with white clouds.",

    "Motion": "From a point-of-view perspective, a motocross rider on a dirt bike is airborne, descending after a jump. While in mid-air, the rider turns the handlebars to the left as the bike falls toward the dirt track below.",
    "Scene": "A dynamic POV shot captures the thrilling journey of a motocross rider launching into the air and landing on an outdoor dirt track during the daytime. The track, made of reddish-brown dirt, features large jumps and banked curves. Beyond the track, a landscape of green fields and scattered trees stretches under a bright blue sky with white clouds. The rider is on a yellow and white dirt bike, marked with the number seven on its front plate, as they navigate the course.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
