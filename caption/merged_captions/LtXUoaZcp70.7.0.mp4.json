  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot, filmed from a high angle looking down, capturing four humanoid figures rendered in a glowing, textured blue material, resembling a digital or holographic effect. These figures, appearing to wear uniforms and caps, are lying on a dark, brown surface that occupies a significant portion of the background. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, employing deep focus to ensure all elements remain sharp. It moves upward while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, initially focusing on the figures from a high angle, and then revealing a broader scene. In the middle ground, one figure lies on the left side of the frame, facing slightly to its right with its arms bent. To its right, a group of three other figures lies in the middle ground, arranged in a row stretching from the center-left towards the right side of the frame. In this group, one figure is lying face down, while another is lying face up, partially on top of the first. The fourth figure on the far right is lying on its right side with its legs bent. All figures have their hands placed behind their backs and their legs bent. Above these figures, a textured surface with a pattern of dots glows with orange and yellow light, extending from the foreground to the background. The video includes an overlay text \"[77]\" located at the bottom left corner of the frame as an on-screen overlay. The movement is very smooth with no shaking, providing a clear view of the blue, wireframe-like human figures in various states of lying down, with some having their limbs in different positions, set against the dimly lit environment.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, capturing the scene from a high angle looking down, slightly above the four humanlike figures in the scene. It employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where all elements remain sharp. The camera moves upward while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, initially focusing on the figures from a high angle, and then revealing a broader scene. The movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features four humanoid figures rendered in a glowing, textured blue material, resembling a digital or holographic effect. All figures appear to be wearing uniforms and caps. The figure on the far left is lying down, facing slightly to its right with its arms bent. In the center, one figure is lying face down, while the other is lying face up, partially on top of the first. The fourth figure on the far right is lying on its right side with its legs bent.",
    "Motion": "The video features a series of blue, wireframe-like human figures lying on the ground in a dark environment. The figures are in various states of lying down, with some having their limbs in different positions. The background consists of a brown floor and a wall with a yellow dot pattern above.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor scene in a dimly lit environment. Four human figures, rendered in a blue, translucent, wireframe-like style, are the main focus. All figures are lying down, with their hands placed behind their backs and their legs bent. They are positioned on a brown surface. Above these figures, a textured surface with a pattern of dots glows with orange and yellow light. The video includes an overlay text \"[77]\" located at the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a wide shot, filmed from a high angle looking down. In the middle ground, four blue, glowing human figures are visible. One figure lies on the left side of the frame. To its right, a group of three other figures lies in the middle ground, arranged in a row stretching from the center-left towards the right side of the frame. These figures are positioned on a dark, brown surface that occupies a significant portion of the background. A textured, glowing yellow dot matrix wall extends from the foreground to the background. An overlay text \"[77]\" is located in the bottom left corner of the frame as an on-screen overlay."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
