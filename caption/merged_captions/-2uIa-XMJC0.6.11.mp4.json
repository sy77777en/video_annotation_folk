  "merged_caption": "The video captures a first-person perspective within a modern, high-tech indoor setting. In the center of the scene, a large, transparent screen dominates the foreground, displaying a circular digital interface with a man in a grey V-neck shirt and necklace. This man, with light skin and dark hair, occupies the central area of the circular frame, which is positioned in the middle of the screen. The background features a colorful wall with shades of blue, pink, and white, occupying a significant portion of the scene. On the left side of the screen, in the middle ground, a low shelving unit holds various items, including what appears to be a drone. Additionally, there is a partially visible floor-to-ceiling window on the left side of the background, revealing a blurred cityscape with buildings. The camera is shot from an eye-level perspective with a generally level angle, occasionally tilting slightly up and down, creating brief high-angle views. It features a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the screen in the foreground. The camera is unsteady, with noticeable shaking, and intermittently tilts downward as the person interacts with a USB connection on the screen. As the video progresses, a hand wearing a red sleeve enters from the bottom of the frame, interacting with the screen's controls located at the bottom edge, unplugging and replugging several USB devices, including an orange and a pink USB drive. The screen changes due to the USB drive being swapped. Simultaneously, a smaller circular inset appears near the bottom right corner of the screen, showing another individual, a Black man in a red hoodie with a focused expression. The overall spatial arrangement emphasizes the interaction between the viewer and the digital interface, with the screen acting as the focal point.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a dynamic, continuous sequence from a first-person perspective, featuring a man with light skin and dark hair displayed on a futuristic, semi-transparent screen. He is shown from the shoulders up, encased in a glowing digital bubble, wearing a grey V-neck shirt and a necklace, and speaking directly to the viewer with subtle shifts in expression. The screen rests on a cylindrical metallic base with several ports glowing in pink, orange, blue, and white, some of which have devices plugged into them. As the video progresses, a smaller circular frame appears, showcasing a Black man in a red hoodie with a focused expression. Midway through, the hand of the person filming, wearing a red sleeve, interacts with the screen's base, unplugging and replugging several USB devices. The background visible through the screen is a blurred cityscape.",
    "Motion": "A man is seen on a circular screen, speaking and moving his head slightly. The background shows a blurred cityscape with buildings. The man continues to speak and move his head, and a hand appears from the bottom of the screen, removing an orange USB drive from the screen's port, reinserting it, and then removing a different pink USB drive. The screen changes due to the USB drive being swapped. The man on the screen continues to speak, and a smaller circular frame with a Black man in a red hoodie appears at the bottom right of the screen.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot set indoors, featuring a modern, high-tech environment with floor-to-ceiling windows. A large, transparent screen displays a video call interface with a circular view of an outdoor urban setting, showing buildings and a clear sky. The time of day appears to be daytime, with bright natural light illuminating the scene. The screen also includes a smaller circular inset showing another person, suggesting a conversation. The room is sleek and futuristic, with colorful walls in shades of blue, pink, and white, and a low shelving unit on the left side, emphasizing digital communication technology.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
