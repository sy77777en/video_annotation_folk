  "merged_caption": "The video presents an abstract scene where vibrant pink and blue colors swirl and intertwine in a fluid motion, occupying the entire frame. Initially, the pink and blue hues are concentrated towards the top center, with droplets and tendrils extending downwards. As the video progresses, the colors appear to erupt and spread upwards, moving towards the edges of the frame, while some droplets drift towards the bottom left and right corners. The colors are suspended in a liquid medium, creating intricate patterns and textures that suggest a sense of movement and flow. The movement of the colors is continuous and fluid, forming intricate, cloud-like shapes with a smooth texture. The dark background provides a stark contrast, enhancing the vividness of the colors and emphasizing their fluid motion. The camera remains stationary, capturing the dynamic interplay of colors as they blend and separate, creating a continuous sense of movement and transformation. The overall composition is visually striking, with the colors creating a captivating and artistic visual experience. The bright pink and cyan hues blend and intertwine, adding a sense of movement and transformation, with droplets and wisps of color drifting and merging. The overall effect is a mesmerizing display of color and form, with no discernible setting or time of day, focusing purely on the visual interplay of the elements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
