  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, level-angle scenery shot from a forward-facing perspective on a container ship. Stacks of red, blue, and gray-colored shipping containers are positioned at the bottom of the frame, leading the eye toward the vast sea stretching to the horizon. The ocean is visible in the middle ground on the left and right sides, stretching into the background to meet the horizon. The sky fills the top half of the frame in the background, featuring rapidly moving time-lapsed grey and white clouds and a bright, hazy sun partially obscured in the top right. The video captures a dramatic time-lapse from the bow of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean, with the camera maintaining a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera is locked onto the ship and appears to move forward smoothly, although the time-lapse effect makes the exact movement difficult to discern. The perspective looks forward over stacks of colorful shipping containers, which lead the eye toward the vast sea stretching to the horizon. Above, a wide expanse of clouds moves rapidly across the sky, with the sun appearing as a bright, hazy orb. The sky is filled with rapidly moving grey and white clouds in a time-lapse, with a bright, hazy sun partially covered. An overlay in the lower right displays the text \"YouTube JEFFHK\" in white and red. The video is captured from a level angle at a height between overhead and aerial level, looking forward from the deck of a cargo ship. The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a dramatic maritime scenery shot.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video, which features mild barrel distortion, is captured from a level angle at a height between overhead and aerial level, looking forward from the deck of a cargo ship. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It is locked onto the ship and appears to move forward smoothly, although the time-lapse effect makes the exact movement difficult to discern.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic maritime scenery shot from the high vantage point of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, and gray-colored shipping containers, which lead the eye toward the vast sea stretching to the horizon. A wide, expansive sky dominates the view, filled with a dynamic, time-lapsed layer of swirling grey and white clouds, with the bright, hazy sun partially obscured. There is no single main subject.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse from the bow of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean. The foreground is filled with stacks of colorful shipping containers, while the vast sea stretches out to the horizon. Above, a wide expanse of clouds moves rapidly across the sky, with the sun appearing as a bright, hazy orb.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage, forward-facing perspective on a massive container ship, the vessel sails across a vast, dark ocean. Stacks of multicolored shipping containers—primarily grey, blue, and orange—are visible on the deck below and ahead, with the sea stretching toward the horizon. The sky is filled with rapidly moving grey and white clouds in a time-lapse, with a bright, hazy sun partially covered. An overlay in the lower right displays the text \"YouTube JEFFHK\" in white and red.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide, level-angle scenery shot from a forward-facing perspective on a container ship.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
