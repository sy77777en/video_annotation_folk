  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene is set in a dark, foggy forest with silhouetted bare trees in the foreground on the left and right. A human figure with light skin and long hair, wearing a bright red shirt and dark pants, is positioned in the middle ground, moving from left to right as the camera trucks right to track the character from the side. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking. The individual runs through an open area of the forest and pauses momentarily as a boxy black drone with a red light emerges from near a standing lantern with a red light in the background on the right, flying from the background to the foreground while casting a conical red searchlight onto the terrain. The drone hovers nearby, scanning the surroundings with its beam. The individual briefly turns back before continuing to the right of the frame, while a white light appears from the left. The person remains in motion, occasionally jumping to avoid the light. Red laser projectiles occasionally appear from the left to the right of the frame as the individual continues to move deeper into the misty woods. A horizontal red laser beam continuously sweeps across the middle ground from left to right. Evergreen trees and a thick fog are visible in the middle ground and background, set against a hazy, blue-tinted sky with faint light beams cutting through the mist. The camera briefly pauses as the character evades a searchlight before resuming its rightward motion to keep them in the frame. An \"IGN\" logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner. After the drone exits the frame, a conical white light enters from the left side of the frame.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the camera trucks right to track a character from the side. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking. It briefly pauses as the character evades a searchlight before resuming its rightward motion to keep them in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features a human figure with light skin and long hair, wearing a bright red shirt and dark pants, which stands out against the dark, misty forest setting. The individual appears alone among tall, thin trees, some of which are bare while others are evergreen, with the red shirt providing a stark contrast to the muted, shadowy tones of the surrounding environment. Additionally, a drone with a red light is visible, seemingly searching for the individual.",
    "Motion": "The human figure runs through an open area of the forest and pauses momentarily as the drone with a red light hovers nearby, scanning the surroundings with its beam. The individual briefly turns back before continuing to the right of the frame, while a white light appears from the left. The person remains in motion, occasionally jumping to avoid the light. Red laser projectiles occasionally appear from the left to the right of the frame as the individual continues to move deeper into the misty woods.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, foggy forest at night. The landscape is filled with silhouetted trees, including bare, spindly ones in the foreground and dense pines in the background, all set against a hazy, blue-tinted sky with faint light beams cutting through the mist. A thick layer of fog blankets the ground, which is dotted with patches of glowing green grass and small white plants. The camera moves from left to right, following the individual movement. A boxy black drone with a red light flies through the scene from the background to the foreground, casting a conical red searchlight onto the ground below. Additionally, a standing lantern with a red light is visible in the background, from where the drone appears. An \"IGN\" logo is visible as an overlay in the bottom right corner.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, the scene is set in a dark, foggy forest with silhouetted bare trees in the foreground on the left and right. A human figure in a red shirt is positioned in the middle ground, moving from left to right as the camera pans to follow. A horizontal red laser beam continuously sweeps across the middle ground from left to right. In the background on the right, a drone emerges from near a red lantern, flying from the background to the foreground while casting a conical red searchlight onto the terrain before exiting to the top. Evergreen trees and a thick fog are visible in the middle ground and background, and an \"IGN\" logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner. After the drone exits the frame, a conical white light enters from the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
