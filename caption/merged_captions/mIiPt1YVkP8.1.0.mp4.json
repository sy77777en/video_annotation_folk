  "merged_caption": "The camera smoothly tracks a white passenger airplane from behind, moving forward to follow it with slight rolls for a dynamic effect. Midway through the shot, the camera gently ascends, enhancing the visual experience and positioning the airplane in the center of the frame. The airplane remains in the foreground against a backdrop of a dark night sky occupying the upper half of the frame. The lower half features a deep dark blue body of water extending from the foreground to the background. In the middle ground, an illuminated airport runway is centrally located, with the lit buildings of the airport terminal on the left. The aircraft has its landing gear extended, showing two sets of wheels beneath its wings, and two engines are visible, one under each wing. Below the plane, an airport is illuminated at night. A long, brightly lit runway, marked with white and green lights, extends into the distance. To the left of the runway, a complex of lit buildings, representing the airport terminal and surrounding structures, is visible. The entire scene is viewed from the air, positioning the airplane as if it is on its final approach for landing. The camera moves forward, following the plane, and adds slight rolls for a dynamic effect. Midway through the shot, it gently ascends. A deep focus keeps both the aircraft and the illuminated airport runway below sharp and in view. The surrounding airport complex, including taxiways and terminal buildings, is visible as a grid of yellowish and white lights against a vast, dark, and unlit landscape or body of water. The aircraft is positioned centrally, aligned perfectly with the runway as it continues its approach.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial, level angle, the smooth camera tracks an airplane from behind. The camera moves forward, following the plane, and adds slight rolls for a dynamic effect. Midway through the shot, it gently ascends. A deep focus keeps both the aircraft and the illuminated airport runway below sharp and in view.",
    "Subject": "A white passenger airplane is depicted from a rear, slightly elevated perspective against a solid black background. The aircraft has its landing gear extended, showing two sets of wheels beneath its wings, and two engines are visible, one under each wing. Below the plane, an airport is illuminated at night. A long, brightly lit runway, marked with white and green lights, extends into the distance. To the left of the runway, a complex of lit buildings, representing the airport terminal and surrounding structures, is visible. The entire scene is viewed from the air, positioning the airplane as if it is on its final approach for landing.",
    "Motion": "The camera smoothly tracks a white passenger airplane from behind, providing a clear and steady view as it approaches an illuminated airport runway at night. As the camera advances, it follows the plane's trajectory with subtle rolls to enhance the dynamic effect. Midway through the shot, the camera gently ascends, adding depth to the scene.",
    "Scene": "From a rear perspective, a white passenger airplane with its landing gear down descends through a black, starless night sky. Below, an airport runway is brightly illuminated with white lights, creating a clear path for landing. The surrounding airport complex, including taxiways and terminal buildings, is visible as a grid of yellowish and white lights against a vast, dark, and unlit landscape or body of water. The aircraft is positioned centrally, aligned perfectly with the runway as it continues its approach.",
    "Spatial": "The camera smoothly tracks a white passenger airplane from behind, moving forward to follow it with slight rolls for a dynamic effect.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
