  "merged_caption": "This abstract video opens with a central, vertical, curving red tube in a stylized, animated environment with deep red, curved, and organic walls. A small, dark brown, teardrop-shaped object is positioned on the upper-right side of this tube and moves downwards through the smooth, curving passage. The camera follows this object as it descends, capturing the journey through an internal body structure with a slightly unsteady camera that exhibits some shaking. The scene then cuts to a wider view of a red, cavernous space, where the bottom is filled with a pool of a textured, opaque, yellowish-tan liquid. The small, dark, teardrop-shaped object strikes the liquid from the top center, causing droplets to splash upwards. This impact creates several small, light-yellow fragments, including two crescent shapes and a tiny dot, which briefly hang in the air before they descend back into the pool, settling into the yellow pool below.",

    "Camera": "This animated video, depicting a journey through an internal body structure, is filmed with a slightly unsteady camera that exhibits some shaking.",
    "Subject": "This animated video presents an abstract depiction of a process within a red, organic-looking environment. A small, dark brown, teardrop-shaped object is shown moving through a smooth, curving red tube. The scene then shifts to the interior of a larger, cavernous red space, which contains a pool of opaque, yellowish-tan liquid at the bottom. Initially, the surface of the liquid is undisturbed. The teardrop-shaped object strikes the liquid, causing droplets to splash upwards, forming several small, light-yellow fragments, including two crescent shapes and a tiny dot.",
    "Motion": "A dark brown, teardrop-shaped object travels down a curving red tube. The scene then shifts, and the object falls into a pool of yellow liquid below. The impact causes the liquid to splash upwards, forming several small, light-yellow fragments that briefly hang in the air.",
    "Scene": "In a stylized, animated environment with deep red, curved, and organic walls, a small, dark, teardrop-shaped object moves down a narrow, curved passage. The scene then shifts to a wider, cavernous space, where the bottom is filled with a pool of a textured, yellowish substance. As the teardrop-shaped object strikes the pool, several small, light-yellow, crescent-shaped splashes are created, settling into the yellow pool below.",
    "Spatial": "This abstract video opens with a central, vertical, curving red tube. A small, dark, teardrop-shaped object is positioned on the upper-right side of this tube and moves downwards. The camera follows this object as it descends. The scene then cuts to a wider view of a red, cavernous space, where a pool of yellow liquid fills the bottom of the frame. The small, dark, teardrop-shaped object strikes the liquid from the top center, causing several light-yellow fragments to splash upwards into the middle of the frame before they descend back into the pool."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
