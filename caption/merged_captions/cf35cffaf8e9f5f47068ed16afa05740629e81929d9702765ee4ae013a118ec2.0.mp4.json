  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, showcasing rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a broad sky. The camera is positioned at a high vantage point, providing a panoramic view of the terrain. In the frame, the hills occupy the background, while the rocky outcrops are positioned in the middle ground, slightly off-center to the left. The foreground is dominated by dry grass and scattered rocks, creating texture, and also includes some grazing cattle. Grazing cattle are dispersed throughout the middle ground, foreground, and background, primarily located towards the lower part of the frame. The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a vast, open landscape during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring rolling hills covered with dry, golden grass and scattered rocky outcrops. In the distance, a range of low, undulating mountains stretches across the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The terrain is dotted with grazing cattle, their dark brown bodies contrasting against the lighter earth tones. Small clusters of trees and a few distant structures are visible, suggesting a rural environment. The drone's perspective provides a broad, panoramic view, emphasizing the expansive and serene nature of the scene. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise at a slow speed, capturing the expansive terrain and cattle without any shaking. As the video progresses, the camera shifts slightly, maintaining the extreme wide shot but altering the angle to reveal more of the distant hills and the grazing cattle, enhancing the sense of depth and scale within the scene. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and the expansive environment rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmony between the land and the sky, and the tranquil coexistence of nature and wildlife.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down on a landscape with grazing cattle. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise at a slow speed, capturing the expansive terrain and cattle without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, open expanse of rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a wide, expansive sky. The terrain is covered with dry grass, and scattered rocks add texture to the scene, while a herd of cattle grazes peacefully, blending into the natural environment. The distant hills create a sense of depth and scale, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and the expansive environment rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmony between the land and the sky, and the tranquil coexistence of nature and wildlife.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a dry, hilly landscape with scattered rocks and sparse vegetation. A herd of cattle is grazing peacefully on the hill, spread out across the terrain. The background features rolling hills and a distant view of mountains under a partly cloudy sky. The camera arcs counterclockwise around the dry, hilly landscape, revealing more of the terrain and the cattle continuing to graze.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
