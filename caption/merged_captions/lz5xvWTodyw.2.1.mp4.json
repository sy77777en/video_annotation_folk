  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic alligator positioned in the center-right of the frame, within a spotlight against a black background. The bipedal, green-skinned alligator stands upright, wearing a light blue, long-sleeved shirt and a black wig. It has large, round, white eyes with black pupils, a long snout with visible white teeth, and a tail. As the spotlight follows its movement, the alligator walks from the right into the spotlight, toward the center, holding a light purple electric guitar with a white, swirled pickguard. The alligator begins to play the guitar, swaying its body and head from side to side as it moves closer to the camera, creating the effect of a closer shot. Throughout the sequence, the alligator's appearance remains consistent as it shifts positions, with the spotlight tracking its movements. In this framing, the alligator appears larger within the frame as it sways to the music, with the camera positioned at the subject's height. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, maintaining a consistent view of the alligator's performance in the spotlight against the black background.",

    "Motion": "An anthropomorphic alligator, holding a purple electric guitar, walks from the right into a spotlight against a black background. A black wig is present on its head throughout the entire scene. The alligator begins to play the guitar, swaying its body and head from side to side as it moves closer to the camera.",
    "Scene": "In a completely black and empty space, a single, bright white spotlight shines down from above, following a cartoon alligator as it moves across the unseen floor. It takes out a light purple guitar and begins to play, moving its body freely to the music as the spotlight keeps pace with its performance.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic alligator positioned in the center-right of the frame, within a spotlight against a black background. As the spotlight follows its movement, the alligator walks toward the center, pulls out a guitar, and begins to play. As it performs, the alligator moves closer to the camera, creating the effect of a closer shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
