  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle full shot, a damaged race car is stationary in the center of the frame, positioned diagonally with its front end on a grass infield in the middle ground to the right and its rear end on a paved surface in the middle ground to the left. The car is a white and black Ford stock car with a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof. The front half of the vehicle is white, while the rear half is black. A blue oval \"Ford\" logo is visible on the crumpled hood, and another \"Ford\" logo is on the rear quarter panel, which also features \"Ford Performance\" text. The front of the car is heavily damaged, with the hood bent upwards, and a small amount of smoke or steam rises from the front. A chain-link fence occupies the bottom left foreground. A white Ford pickup truck with \"BUILT FORD TOUGH\" on the front enters the frame from the top left corner, slowly drives forward on the pavement toward the rear of the stopped race car, and then stops on the road, opening its door. The truck comes to a stop in the background at the top left of the frame, positioned behind the stationary race car. From a slightly unsteady overhead position, the camera captures the crashed race car from a high angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and slightly zooms out at the very end of the video. The gray asphalt of the track is marked with a solid yellow line.",

    "Subject": "The main subject is a damaged race car, stopped at an angle with its front end on a grassy area and its rear on a paved surface. The car is a white and black Ford stock car with a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof. The front half of the vehicle is white, while the rear half is black.

The front of the car is heavily damaged, with the hood bent upwards, and a small amount of smoke or steam rises from the front. A secondary subject, a white Ford pickup truck with \"BUILT FORD TOUGH\" on the front, enters the frame behind the race car.",
    "Motion": "A damaged race car remains stationary at an angle, with its front on a grassy area and its rear on a paved surface. A white pickup truck enters the frame from the top left corner, slowly drives forward on the pavement toward the rear of the stopped race car, and then stops on the road, opening its door.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, a damaged race car is stopped on a green grass infield adjacent to a paved racetrack. The car, featuring a white and black design with the number 98 in red and \"Ford\" logos, has a crumpled front end from which a wisp of smoke rises. The gray asphalt of the track is marked with a solid yellow line, and a chain-link fence is located at the bottom left corner of the frame. A white pickup truck enters the frame from the top left and comes to a stop near the rear of the stationary race car.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle full shot, a damaged race car is stationary in the center of the frame, positioned diagonally with its front end on a grass infield in the middle ground to the right and its rear end on a paved surface in the middle ground to the left. A chain-link fence occupies the bottom left foreground. A white pickup truck enters the frame from the top left and moves down and to the right, coming to a stop in the background at the top left of the frame, positioned behind the stationary race car."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
