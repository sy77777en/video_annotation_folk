  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a traditional Japanese garden, where a tranquil pond extends from the foreground to the middle ground, reflecting the partly cloudy sky above. Initially, a stone pathway is visible on the right side of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground before exiting the frame as the camera pans left. A stone lantern, initially positioned on the center left, adds a classical touch but moves to the right and exits the frame as the camera shifts. The garden's lush greenery, including trees with red and green leaves, spans from the middle ground to the background. In the distance, modern buildings rise above the treetops, creating a contrast between nature and urban architecture. The camera features a smooth, steady movement at eye level, capturing the serene lakeside scene. It pans left throughout the sequence, initially tilting slightly downward before gradually tilting upward to maintain a level view of the lake. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. As the camera continues to move left, more of the pond and the surrounding rocks come into view, with the reflection of the sky and trees visible on the water's surface. The scene concludes with a full view of the pond, the rocks, and the buildings, all bathed in the golden hues of the sunset. The warm, golden light of the late afternoon casts long shadows across the landscape, enhancing the reflective surface of the pond and casting a peaceful ambiance over the entire scene. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the natural beauty of the garden harmoniously blending with the urban skyline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
