  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a small, cloaked figure standing on a large, tiled platform that occupies the middle ground in a dimly lit, green-hued chamber. The platform is made of gray stone tiles arranged in a grid, enclosed by a low wall, with four lit torches on pedestals at the corners casting a warm glow. A game HUD is overlaid in the top-left corner, displaying a yellow health bar, ability icons including a sword and bow, and four white diamond shapes. Suddenly, a massive, bipedal, frog-like monster with bloated, light green skin and a red harness across its large chest emerges from beneath the platform. It wields a large, spring-like weapon that glows with a red light. The camera tracks the avatar as it runs from the monster, and the shot becomes slightly unsteady, shaking each time the monster strikes the floor. The monster raises its glowing red axe and slams it down, shattering the tiles below as the small figure, dressed in black with white eyes visible and carrying a weapon that emits a purple glow, dodges to the side. The monster then leaps into the air and lands back in the arena, creating shockwaves that break more tiles, while the small figure continues to dodge away from the impact. As the scene progresses, the monster smashes the ground, causing tiles to break and fall away, revealing pits underneath. Throughout the scene, the lit torches remain positioned at the corners of the platform, maintaining their warm glow amidst the chaos.",

    "Camera": "This is a high-angle, aerial level shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera tracks the avatar as it runs from the monster, and the shot becomes slightly unsteady, shaking each time the monster strikes the floor.",
    "Subject": "A massive, bipedal, frog-like monster with bloated, light green skin appears in a video game. The creature wears a red harness across its large chest and wields a large, spring-like weapon that glows with a red light. It confronts a much smaller, cloaked figure. This small figure is dressed in black, with white eyes visible, and carries a weapon that emits a purple glow.",
    "Motion": "A small, cloaked figure stands and runs on a tiled arena. A large, green, frog-like monster emerges from beneath the tiles, raising a glowing red axe and slamming it down, shattering the tiles below as the small figure dodges to the side. The monster then leaps into the air and lands back in the arena, creating shockwaves that break more tiles, while the small figure continues to dodge away from the impact.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a dimly lit, green-hued chamber. The central feature is a square platform made of gray stone tiles arranged in a grid, enclosed by a low wall. Four lit torches on pedestals are placed at the corners of the platform, casting a warm glow. During the scene, a large green creature appears and smashes the ground, causing some of the stone tiles to break and fall away, revealing a pit underneath. An overlay in the top-left corner displays a heads-up display with a yellow health bar, ability icons including a sword and bow, and four white diamond shapes.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a small, cloaked figure standing on a large, tiled platform that occupies the middle ground. Suddenly, a massive, green monster emerges from beneath the platform and leaps into the air, also in the middle ground. The monster then smashes the ground, causing tiles to break and fall away, creating pits. As this occurs, the small figure moves around the platform. Throughout the scene, lit torches are positioned at the corners of the platform, and a game HUD is overlaid in the top-left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
