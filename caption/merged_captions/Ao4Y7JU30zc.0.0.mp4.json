  "merged_caption": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center middle ground of a dimly lit and hazy locker room. He is seated on a bench that extends along the wall from the right middle ground to the left background. The man, with a shaved head, is seen in silhouette, wearing a dark, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and dark sneakers. Leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped, he keeps his head bowed in a contemplative posture. He slowly rubs his hands together and at one point briefly brings both hands close to his mouth. A dark silhouette object in the left foreground partially obscures the view. In the background and middle ground, a sign that reads \"BUDE RFC CORNWALL & DEVON CHAMPIONS 2016\" and a row of empty clothes hangers are mounted on the wall behind the man, with a doorway visible on the far left. The scene is lit dramatically from one side, with a single light source from above and to the left creating a strong backlight, casting a long shadow on the wall behind him and obscuring his facial features. The camera, from a low, ground-level position, trucks left while panning right, keeping the silhouetted person sitting on the bench centered in the frame. The shot uses a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire dark room relatively sharp.",

    "Motion": "A man sits still on a bench, leaning forward with his hands clasped. He slowly rubs his hands together, then briefly lifts them toward his chin.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit and hazy locker room, a silhouetted figure sits on a simple bench against a stark wall. A single light source from above and to the left creates a strong backlight, casting a prominent shadow. Above the bench, a row of empty clothes hangers is mounted on the wall next to a sign that reads, \"BUDE RFC CORNWALL & DEVON CHAMPIONS 2016.\" The room features a plain concrete floor and unadorned walls.",
    "Spatial": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center middle ground of a dimly lit room.

In the background and middle ground, a sign and a row of clothes hangers are mounted on the wall behind the man, with a doorway visible on the far left. The camera trucks left while panning right at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
