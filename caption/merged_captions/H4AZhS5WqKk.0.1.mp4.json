  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot is framed at a ground level, level angle, focusing on a wet, dark stone floor that occupies the foreground and middle ground. A single green olive drops onto the lower-center of the frame on this foreground surface. The camera employs a shallow focus, concentrating on the foreground where the olive falls. To the left, in the middle ground, a black object with exposed wires is positioned next to a small white block. A dark concrete step runs horizontally across the middle ground, separating the floor from the dimly lit background, which contains indistinct brown shapes like a box and a shelf. The olive is round and has a shiny surface, reflecting the ambient light. In the latter part of the video, a hand from an atypical 2D character comes into view from the top and moves toward the olive. The hand appears to grasp the olive, seemingly ready to pick it up.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, ground-level shot filmed at a level angle. The camera employs a shallow focus, concentrating on the foreground where the olive falls.",
    "Subject": "A single, small, green olive drops onto a wet, dark stone-paved floor. The olive is round and has a shiny surface, reflecting the ambient light. To the left, on the same floor, sits a small, white rectangular block to the right of a larger, black object. This black object has a complex shape with some white sections and exposed wires visible at its top. In the latter part of the video, a hand from an atypical 2D character comes into view and tries to pick up the olive.",
    "Motion": "A green olive drops onto a wet stone floor. A 2D animated hand enters the frame from the top and moves toward the olive. The hand appears to grasp the olive, seemingly ready to pick it up.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a dark, wet floor composed of large, uneven flagstones. A single, green olive drops onto the lower-center of the frame on the wet surface. In the middleground, a rough, dark grey concrete step runs horizontally across the shot. To the left, on the floor, sits a black object with exposed wires, next to which is a small, white rectangular block. The area behind the step, in the background, is dimly lit and contains indistinct brown shapes, resembling a box and a shelf.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
