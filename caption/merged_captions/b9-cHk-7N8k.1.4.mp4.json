  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with a houseboat included to provide a sense of scale. The foreground is composed of a rocky shoreline that fills the bottom third of the frame, indicating a low water level. In the middle ground, a large, white houseboat is moored in the bottom right, in a calm cove that extends across the center of the scene. A smaller boat is tied to the side of the houseboat, and a paddleboard is visible in the water nearby. The background is dominated by a range of large, reddish-brown rock formations and canyons that stretch across the upper half of the frame, silhouetted against a bright horizon. The sky occupies the top of the frame, covered in dark clouds with a bright, warm glow on the horizon, suggesting the time is either sunrise or sunset. The camera maintains a fixed, slightly elevated position from the shore, looking out over the water and towards the distant canyon walls. This static, eye-level time-lapse video uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape, from the foreground shore to the distant rock formations, sharp and clear as the sun sets and clouds move rapidly across the sky. The still water reflects the sky and the surrounding landscape, enhancing the serene atmosphere. The presence of the houseboat emphasizes the immense size of the surrounding landscape, and the scene is framed with black bars at the top and bottom.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level time-lapse video shot from a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape, from the foreground shore to the distant rock formations, sharp and clear as the sun sets and clouds move rapidly across the sky.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a serene landscape scenery shot of a calm lake nestled within a vast canyon of reddish-brown rock formations. The focus is on the grand scale and dramatic atmosphere of the natural environment rather than a specific subject. A white houseboat is moored in a small, quiet cove, its presence serving to emphasize the immense size of the surrounding landscape. The scene is set at either sunrise or sunset, with a dark, cloudy sky overhead contrasting with a bright, warm glow on the horizon, which casts a gentle reflection across the still surface of the water.",
    "Motion": "This is an extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape at either sunrise or sunset. A large houseboat is moored in a calm cove, surrounded by dramatic red rock canyons. The sun glows on the horizon from behind the rock formations, reflecting on the still water.",
    "Scene": "An extreme wide shot shows a large, white houseboat moored in a calm cove on a lake, surrounded by vast, reddish-brown rock formations and canyons. The time is either sunrise or sunset, with a bright glow on the horizon behind the silhouetted buttes, while the rest of the sky is covered in dark clouds. The still water reflects the sky and the surrounding landscape. A smaller boat is tied to the side of the houseboat, and a paddleboard is visible in the water nearby. The rocky, sandy shoreline in the foreground and along the edges of the cove indicates a low water level. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
