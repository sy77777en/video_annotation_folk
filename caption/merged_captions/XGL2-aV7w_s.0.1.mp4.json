  "merged_caption": "A full-body line drawing of a man materializes slightly to the center-right of the frame, depicted in a dynamic Tai Chi pose. This figure then fades and is replaced by a drawing of a smiling chef, positioned in the center, wearing a tall hat and holding a wok and a spatula. As the chef remains, a serpentine creature, depicted as a Chinese dragon with a dragon-like head, horns, and a fish-like tail, appears next to the chef. The dragon's head appears at the bottom right, and its tail appears at the top right. Subsequently, all existing drawings disappear, and a single, large drawing of a complete, long, white, serpentine dragon gradually swims onto the screen. This dragon is coiled in a loop that dominates the center of the frame, moving in a horizontal figure-eight pattern, with its head positioned in the top right and its tail extending towards the right. The dragon features a scaly body, a spiky ridge along its back, a flowing tail, and a detailed head with horns, whiskers, and a bridle. All elements are presented against a static, textured, parchment-like background. The video presents a sequence of black-and-white line drawings that transition into one another, with a completely static camera throughout.",

    "Subject": "A black-and-white line drawing of a man is shown from the front, wearing loose pants and a headband in a dynamic pose. This figure is then depicted as a smiling chef with a tall hat and a jacket, holding a large bowl and a ladle. A long, serpentine creature, depicted as a Chinese dragon with a dragon-like head, horns, and a fish-like tail, appears next. This creature later transforms into a long, white, serpentine dragon, coiled in a large loop, with a scaly body, a spiky ridge along its back, a flowing tail, and a detailed head with horns, whiskers, and a bridle.",
    "Motion": "The video presents a sequence of black-and-white line drawings that transition into one another. Initially, a drawing of a man in a dynamic Tai Chi pose is shown. This image is then replaced by a depiction of a smiling chef holding a wok and a spatula. A serpentine creature, which is the evolving dragon, appears next to the chef, and the scene concludes with a full view of a long, coiled, white dragon.",
    "Scene": "In a black-and-white line drawing animation set against a textured, parchment-like background, a figure practicing Tai Chi is depicted. Following this, a chef with a tall hat is shown using a spatula to stir-fry in a wok. Then, a long, white, serpentine dragon with scales and a spined back materializes. The dragon, which has a bridle around its head, unfurls its body into a large curve across the neutral space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
