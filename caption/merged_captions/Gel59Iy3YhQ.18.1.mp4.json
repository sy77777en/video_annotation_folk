  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the camera moves rightward from a level angle at overhead height, tracking the main subject, a young boy with pale skin wearing a bright red long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, as he walks forward in a straight line in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, directly under a spotlight cast from a fixture at the top of the frame. The boy is singled out by the spotlight, standing with his shoulders hunched forward. Surrounding him are numerous other pale-skinned, human-like figures dressed uniformly in dark, non-descript clothing, lacking distinct facial features. A large group of these figures is clustered to the left in the middle ground, while several others walk forward in a single line with the boy, also in the middle ground, all with a similar hunched posture. The environment is a vast, dark warehouse-like structure rendered in a monochromatic style, with high ceilings, exposed beams, and large, high-up windows. The dark floor is marked with yellow lines. In the background, a large open doorway is positioned in the center-right, through which a foggy exterior with a bare tree and the silhouette of a bus is visible. The boy's red shirt makes him the only point of color, creating a stark contrast with the monochrome appearance of all the other figures in the scene. At the end of the video, the boy stops and lowers his head.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle at overhead height, the camera smoothly moves to the right, tracking a boy in a red shirt as he walks across a large, dark room.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a young boy with pale skin, wearing a bright red long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. He is singled out by a spotlight, standing with his shoulders hunched forward. Surrounding him are numerous other pale-skinned, human-like figures dressed uniformly in dark, non-descript clothing. These figures, which appear to be both male and female, lack distinct facial features. A large group of them stands clustered together to the left, while several others are scattered individually around the boy, some standing still and others walking slowly with a similar hunched posture. The boy's red shirt makes him the only point of color, creating a stark contrast with the monochrome appearance of all the other figures in the scene.",
    "Motion": "A boy in a red shirt moves slowly in a single file with several other figures in dark clothing, all with a hunched posture, while a larger group remains stationary in a cluster to the left.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video shows a scene inside a vast, dark warehouse-like structure. The environment is rendered in a monochromatic style, with high ceilings, exposed beams, and large, high-up windows. A single spotlight hangs from the ceiling, casting a bright, circular beam onto the dark floor, which is marked with yellow lines. In the background, a large open doorway reveals a foggy exterior with a bare tree and the silhouette of a bus. Numerous stylized, faceless figures in dark clothing are scattered throughout the space, some standing in a group while others are positioned individually. A single figure wearing a red shirt stands directly within the spotlight's beam.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, the camera moves rightward as the main subject, a boy in a red shirt, walks forward in a straight line in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, directly under a spotlight cast from a fixture at the top of the frame. A large group of figures is clustered to the left in the middle ground, while several other figures walk forward in a single line with the boy, also in the middle ground. In the background, a large doorway is positioned in the center-right, through which a bus and a tree are visible. At the end of the video, the boy stops and lowers his head."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
