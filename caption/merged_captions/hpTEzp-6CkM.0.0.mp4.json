  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a black t-shirt and a forward-facing grey baseball cap, in the foreground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame. He holds the camera selfie-style at his level on an outdoor metal walkway high above a sprawling cityscape during the daytime under a clear blue sky. Initially, his left arm is raised in the air, and a woman with dark hair tied back, wearing a pink patterned top, is visible in the middle ground to the left of the center, standing on the metal walkway that extends from the bottom left into the middle ground. As the video plays, the man lowers his arm and begins speaking to the camera, which displays mild barrel distortion and is held at eye-level height. The camera initially points straight ahead before being lifted and tilted down into a high angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera movement is unsteady and shaky, finishing with a pan to the left as the person moves their arm. Other people are seen standing along the walkway in the middle ground. A man with black hair, wearing a blue t-shirt with patterns on the chest, is seen waving in the middle ground behind the main subject. Two other men with light skin and short blond hair appear beside the woman and the man in the blue t-shirt in the center-right of the frame; one wears a white t-shirt and dark pants, while the man behind him wears a white long-sleeved top and dark pants, making a peace sign with his hand. The background consists of a dense urban environment stretching to the horizon, filled with numerous buildings of various sizes on the left side, and a tall, white, metal lattice structure, part of a building located behind the one they are on, rises into the sky on the right.",

    "Camera": "The video displays mild barrel distortion. Shot from an eye-level height, the camera, held by the person taking a selfie, initially points straight ahead before being lifted and tilted down into a high angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera movement is unsteady and shaky, finishing with a pan to the left as the person moves their arm.",
    "Subject": "In the video, a man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a black t-shirt and a forward-facing grey baseball cap, holds the camera selfie-style. He is initially smiling with one arm raised and later speaks to the camera. Behind him stands a man with black hair, wearing a blue t-shirt with patterns on the chest. Further back along the walkway, a woman with dark hair tied back, wearing a pink patterned top, appears. Beside her, two other men are visible; one wears a white t-shirt and dark pants, while the man behind him wears a white long-sleeved top and dark pants, making a peace sign with his hand. Both these men have light skin and short blond hair.",
    "Motion": "A man in a black T-shirt holds a camera selfie-style with his right arm, while his left arm is initially raised in the air and then lowered as he begins speaking to the camera. Behind him, several people stand on a narrow platform, waving towards the camera. Although the man holding the camera appears relatively stationary, there is slight body movement, and he eventually turns slightly to his left.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot shows a person holding the camera on an outdoor metal walkway high above a sprawling cityscape. The video takes place during the daytime under a clear blue sky. Below, a dense urban environment stretches to the horizon, filled with numerous buildings of various sizes. Adjacent to the walkway, a tall, white, metal lattice structure, part of a building located behind the one they are on, rises into the sky. The walkway itself is constructed from dark metal beams and grating. Other people are visible on the walkway in the middle ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
