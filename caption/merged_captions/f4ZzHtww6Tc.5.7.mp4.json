  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man with a light brown skin tone and tattoos on his left arm is skateboarding on a sidewalk, initially positioned in the center foreground. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, and white socks pulled up his calves, with black and white sneakers, and in some views, a black beanie. The scene unfolds on a concrete sidewalk in a sunny, urban setting, with a street visible on the left and a modern building with a gray lower wall and an upper facade of vertical fins on the right. The building features a sign reading \"HOLLYWOOD BILTMORE\" and the address \"1745.\" Tall palm trees, green shrubbery, a cactus, and a yellow fire hydrant populate the environment. The man uses his foot to push off and skillfully leap over the fire hydrant with his skateboard, which has a dark-colored deck and light, metallic-looking trucks. As he crouches down, the camera, positioned at the subject's level, arcs clockwise around him, keeping him in the center of the frame. The slightly unsteady camera, filmed with noticeable fisheye distortion, tracks the skateboarder from behind, moving forward in an arc as it pans right and shifts left to transition into a side-tracking shot. The entire scene is captured during the daytime under a bright, slightly hazy sky, with deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp. As the man skates past, the yellow fire hydrant enters the frame in the bottom middle ground, and a car is visible in the distance on the street. The dynamic poses of the man, bending his knees and leaning forward as he rides, are captured in various views, emphasizing the movement and energy of the scene.",

    "Motion": "A man uses his foot to push off and skillfully leap over a fire hydrant with his skateboard on a sidewalk.",
    "Scene": "Filmed from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a concrete sidewalk in a sunny, urban setting, capturing a full shot of a man on a skateboard. Adjacent to the sidewalk is a street with a car in the distance. The primary architectural feature is a modern building with a gray lower wall and an upper facade of vertical fins. A sign on the building reads \"HOLLYWOOD BILTMORE,\" and the address \"1745\" is displayed in lettering attached to a low wall facing the street. The environment is populated with tall palm trees, green shrubbery, and a cactus. A yellow fire hydrant is positioned on a corner of the sidewalk. The scene is captured during the daytime under a bright, slightly hazy sky.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man on a skateboard is initially positioned in the center foreground. He pushes off and remains generally in the center of the frame as he crouches down. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, arcs clockwise around the man, keeping him in the center of the frame. In the middle ground, a street is visible on the left, while a building and palm trees occupy the right. As the man skates past, a yellow fire hydrant enters the frame in the bottom middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
