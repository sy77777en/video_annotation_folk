  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up on a dark, wall-mounted intercom system positioned in the right foreground, featuring a circular, perforated speaker grille and a single, light-colored button. The scene is dimly lit with a greenish hue from overhead fluorescent lights. As a buzzing sound fills the air, several blurred figures in the background rise from their seats and direct their attention toward the intercom. A person with dark skin and short, dark, textured hair, wearing a dark, possibly green, jacket, enters the frame from the right, moving toward the center to interact with the intercom. This person approaches the intercom, extends their right hand, and presses the button on the device, silencing the buzzing sound. The camera, slightly unsteady and fixed at an eye-level angle, begins with a shallow depth of field focusing on the intercom in the foreground. As the person interacts with the intercom, the shot transitions to a medium close-up of the person, who now occupies the center-left of the frame. The camera performs a rack focus, shifting from the intercom to the person, while remaining at the subjects' level throughout the scene. The intercom box, mounted on a post, features visible wiring at the top, and the background remains out of focus as the camera's focus shifts.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from an eye-level and level angle, beginning with a shallow depth of field that focuses on an intercom in the foreground before performing a rack focus to a person who approaches the intercom in the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video opens with a close-up on a dark, wall-mounted intercom system featuring a circular, perforated speaker grille and a single, light-colored button. As a buzzing sound is heard, several people in the blurred background stand up and look toward the intercom. Following this, a person with dark skin and short, dark, textured hair, wearing a dark, possibly green, jacket, enters the frame from the right. This person reaches out with their right hand and presses the button on the intercom, causing the buzzing to stop. The camera's focus then shifts from the intercom to the person.",
    "Motion": "As a buzzing sound fills the air, several figures in the blurred background rise from their seats and direct their attention toward the intercom. A person then walks into the frame from the right, approaches the wall-mounted intercom, extends their right hand, and presses the button on the device, silencing the buzzing sound as the camera's focus shifts from the intercom to the person.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor space cast in a greenish hue from overhead fluorescent lights, a dark, metallic intercom box is mounted on a post in the foreground. The box features a circular speaker grille, a single round button, and visible wiring at the top. The background is out of focus, but as the persistent buzzing sound is heard, several individuals who were seated stand up and focus their attention on the intercom. A person with dark skin and short, dark, textured hair, wearing a dark—possibly green—jacket, enters the frame in the middle ground from the right side. This person approaches the intercom and presses the button, silencing the noise.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up on an intercom system positioned in the right foreground, with several blurred figures visible in the background. A person then enters the frame from the right, moving toward the center to interact with the intercom. As they do, the shot transitions to a medium close-up of the person, who now occupies the center-left of the frame. The camera's focus shifts from the intercom in the foreground to the person, while the camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
