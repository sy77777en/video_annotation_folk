  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, initially frames a man on a skateboard in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground as he jumps onto a handrail. The man, wearing a white T-shirt over a black long-sleeve shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie, has a light skin tone and long hair. To his right, the left side of the frame is a grassy area, and below him is a set of stairs descending toward the bottom of the frame. In the background, pedestrians, including a woman with a light skin tone and long hair wearing a beige coat, are visible on a paved area at the top of the frame. The man grinds down the handrail, moving diagonally from the center toward the bottom of the frame, maintaining his balance and control as he slides down, using his arms for stability. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, he lands smoothly on the cobblestone path at the base of the stairs and continues to skate forward in the bottom center of the frame, still in the middle ground. The camera, featuring an overhead-level view at a high angle, smoothly moves backward to track the skateboarder from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It tilts downward and pans left as the skateboarder descends, maintaining smooth and steady motion. The skateboarder becomes larger in the frame during the tracking shot. The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a paved area with a mix of concrete and cobblestone surfaces, adjacent to a patch of green grass. The environment is open and spacious, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, suggesting a public space like a plaza or park. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed visibility of the surroundings.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly zooms out to track a skateboarder from above as they perform tricks. It tilts downward and pans left as the skateboarder descends, maintaining smooth and steady motion. The skateboarder becomes larger in the frame during the tracking shot.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man skateboarding down the handrail of a set of stairs. He is wearing a white T-shirt over a black long-sleeve shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie. He has a light skin tone and long hair, and is focused on his activity. In the background, a woman with a light skin tone and long hair, wearing a beige coat, is visible walking on the pavement. The man successfully navigates the handrail and continues walking on the path, showcasing his skateboarding skills.",
    "Motion": "A man on a skateboard approaches a set of stairs and begins to descend the handrail. He maintains his balance and control as he slides down the handrail, using his arms for stability. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, he lands smoothly on the ground and continues to skate forward. The background shows a paved area with a grassy patch and a few people walking in the distance.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a paved area with a mix of concrete and cobblestone surfaces. The scene includes a series of steps and a low concrete wall with a metal railing, adjacent to a patch of green grass. The environment is open and spacious, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, suggesting a public space like a plaza or park. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed visibility of the surroundings. The video shows motion as a person on a skateboard navigates the steps and railing, adding dynamic movement to the otherwise static architectural elements.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, initially frames a man on a skateboard in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground as he jumps onto a handrail.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
