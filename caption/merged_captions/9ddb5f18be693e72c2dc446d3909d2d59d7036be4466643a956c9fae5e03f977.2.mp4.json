  "merged_caption": "This is a level, close-up shot from ground level, capturing a yellow, dimpled golf ball speckled with dark dirt, positioned in the bottom left of the frame on a patch of green grass. A person's out-of-focus lower leg and foot, clad in light-colored trousers and a dark-colored shoe with a white stripe and white laces, occupy the middle ground in the center-right. The camera is fixed at a slightly unsteady, level angle and employs a shallow depth of field, rendering the foreground in sharp detail while the middle ground and background, featuring a hazy sky and indistinct foliage, remain blurred. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings into the frame from the top right, moving toward the stationary yellow golf ball. The club strikes the ball, propelling it forward and out of view, while the club continues its upward swing, also exiting the frame. This action leaves a static view of the grass extending from the foreground to the background, with the blurred leg still visible in the middle ground.",

    "Camera": "From a fixed, slightly unsteady, ground-level angle, the camera is positioned at a level angle and employs a shallow depth of field. It captures the yellow golf ball and the grass in the foreground in sharp detail, while the middle ground and background remain blurred. In the second part of the video, the yellow golf ball flies out of frame.",
    "Subject": "A yellow, dimpled golf ball, speckled with dark dirt, rests on a patch of green grass. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings into view and strikes the ball, after which both the club and the ball exit the scene. In the blurred middle ground, a person's lower leg and foot are visible. The person wears light-colored trousers and a dark-colored shoe that has a white stripe and white laces.",
    "Motion": "A silver golf club swings into the frame from the left and strikes a stationary yellow golf ball. The impact propels the ball forward and out of view, and the club continues its upward swing, also exiting the frame.",
    "Scene": "From a ground-level and level-angle perspective on a grassy field, a yellow, dimpled golf ball with dark scuff marks rests on the green turf. In the out-of-focus middle ground, a person's leg and shoe are visible, while the background features a hazy sky and indistinct foliage. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings swiftly into the foreground, strikes the ball, and sends it flying out of the frame, leaving only the grass in view.",
    "Spatial": "This is a level, close-up shot from ground level. Initially, a yellow golf ball is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, while a person's out-of-focus leg and foot occupy the middle ground in the center-right. A silver golf club swings into the foreground from the top right, moving toward the ball. Upon impact, both the club and the ball are propelled out of the frame, leaving a static view of the grass extending from the foreground to the background and the blurred leg in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
