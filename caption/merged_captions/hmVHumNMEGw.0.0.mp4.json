  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, three young men are positioned from the foreground to the middle ground of a tiled underpass, with a row of fluorescent lights visible at the top of the frame in the middle ground. Initially, one man with medium skin tone, short dark hair, wearing a white hoodie and light gray sweatpants, stands on the left side of the frame, leaning against the back wall with one leg bent and his hands in his pockets. Another young man with a darker skin tone, dressed in a bright orange and black patterned hooded jacket with the hood up and black pants, stands facing the first young man in the center-left. The main subject, a man with dark skin wearing a beanie, on a black bicycle, is positioned on the center-right. He wears a red, white, and dark striped short-sleeve shirt and dark blue jeans. The scene is illuminated by a row of long, rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a cool, greenish glow. The man on the bicycle, initially positioned in front of the two other men and to the right of the frame against a tiled wall, starts pedaling forward toward the camera midway through the video, moving from the center-right to the center of the frame. The camera, positioned at a hip-level and level angle, performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc around the three men, featuring a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and regular motion. The other two subjects remain mostly stationary against the wall. By the end of the video, all subjects are located in the center and right middle ground of the frame. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, with outdoor light sources visible at both ends of the underpass.",

    "Subject": "The video centers on a young man with medium skin tone, short dark hair, who is wearing a white hoodie and light gray sweatpants while leaning against a tiled wall with one leg bent and his hands in his pockets. To his right stands another young man with a darker skin tone, dressed in a bright orange and black patterned hooded jacket with the hood up and black pants, facing the first young man. A third young man, with dark skin and wearing a beanie, is riding a black bicycle; he wears a red, white, and dark striped short-sleeve shirt and dark blue jeans. The man on the bicycle approaches and faces away from the two standing men, toward the camera.",
    "Motion": "A young man on a black bicycle, initially positioned in front of two other men and to the right of the frame against a tiled wall, starts pedaling forward toward the camera midway through the video. The two men standing against the wall remain mostly stationary.",
    "Scene": "In a tiled underpass, the scene is illuminated by a row of long, rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a cool, greenish glow. The walls are composed of light-colored, rectangular tiles, and the ground appears light in color. Three young men are positioned in the underpass. One man sits on a dark-colored electric bicycle equipped with a basket on the front, while two others stand against the tiled wall behind him. The man on the bicycle moves to the center during the middle of the video, while the other two remain mostly still against the wall. The scene is illuminated by a row of long, rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, and there are also outdoor light sources at both ends of the underpass.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, three young men are positioned from the foreground to the middle ground of a tiled underpass, with a row of fluorescent lights visible at the top of the frame in the middle ground. Initially, one man stands on the left side of the frame, and another leans against the back wall in the center-left. The main subject, a man on a bicycle, is positioned on the center-right. He then rides the bicycle slightly forward, moving from the center-right to the center of the frame, with the camera moving along with him. The other two subjects remain mostly stationary against the wall. By the end of the video, all subjects are located in the center and right middle ground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and arcs counterclockwise around the men."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
