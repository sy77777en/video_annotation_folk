  "merged_caption": "A medium shot captures a young woman with lightly tanned skin and shoulder-length, wavy, blonde-highlighted hair, positioned in the center of the frame, standing in the foreground on a sandy surface. She is wearing a black one-piece swimsuit with a square neckline, accessorized with large hoop earrings, multiple necklaces including a choker and a longer lariat-style one, and several bracelets on both wrists. A small tattoo is visible on her upper right arm. A large, dark rock formation occupies the background, with craggy textures and deep shadows cast by the bright sunlight. The woman unties a blue and white patterned sarong from her waist and holds it out with both hands. The wind blows her hair as she spreads her arms wide and begins to turn and spin, allowing the sarong to billow out behind her. She then begins to walk forward and turn, moving from the center towards the right of the frame as the sarong billows behind her. The camera, positioned at her level, follows her movement, keeping her as the central focus while she moves across the scene. This slow-motion video features a smooth, eye-level camera capturing the girl in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera tracks backward and to the right, then pans right and tilts down to continue following her, shifting the perspective from a level to a high angle.",

    "Subject": "A young woman with lightly tanned skin and shoulder-length, wavy, blonde-highlighted hair stands in the video. She is wearing a black one-piece swimsuit with a square neckline, accessorized with large hoop earrings, multiple necklaces including a choker and a longer lariat-style one, and several bracelets on both wrists. A small tattoo is visible on her upper right arm. Initially, she has a blue and white patterned sarong tied around her waist, which she then unties and holds out behind her with both hands, letting it billow as she turns and walks forward.",
    "Motion": "A woman walks in front of a rock formation as the wind blows her hair. She looks down and unties a blue and white patterned sarong from her waist. Holding the fabric in both hands, she spreads her arms wide and begins to turn and spin, allowing the sarong to billow out behind her.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors during the day at a sandy location at the base of a large, dark rock formation. The rock wall is craggy and textured, with deep shadows cast by the bright sunlight. A woman in a black swimsuit stands on the sand. She holds a large, blue and white patterned cloth, which billows in the wind as she moves in front of the rocky backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
