  "merged_caption": "In a static wide shot, a gymnast in a red leotard is positioned in the center of the frame, performing on a set of uneven bars located in the middle ground. A coach stands in the left middle ground near the bars, while another coach is in the middle ground to the right of the apparatus. Judges are seated at a table directly behind the bars in the middle ground, with spectators filling the stands in the background across the top of the frame. The gymnast moves dynamically around the central apparatus, executing a series of flips and rotations as she transitions between the high and low bars. Her routine culminates in a dismount where she flies from the bars and lands on a mat in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the apparatus's center, achieving a perfect landing. After the gymnast lands, some people cheer and run from the bottom foreground towards the gymnast. Throughout her performance, the coaches in the middle ground adjust their positions slightly, but the overall camera framing remains unchanged. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera remains completely static, capturing the gymnastics event without any movement or shaking. The setting is a gymnasium with a high ceiling and bright artificial lighting, featuring a large gymnastics floor surrounded by equipment, including uneven bars and mats. The environment is bustling with activity, as gymnasts and coaches move around the equipment. Spectators are primarily seated in bleachers in the background and on the right side, watching the events unfold. The arena is decorated with banners and signage, displaying team names and logos.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
