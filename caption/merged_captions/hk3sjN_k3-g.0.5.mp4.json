  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot of a woman positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on rocks beside a shallow, flowing stream that occupies the foreground. She is wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans, with short hair, and is facing to the right with her posture slightly bent forward as she looks down towards the water, occasionally moving her forearms. The dense forest fills the background, with another person visible in the distant background to the left. The surrounding environment is dense with green trees and foliage, with the ground covered in dirt and rocks. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders. The camera is positioned at a level angle above the water, employing a deep focus that results in a large depth of field where most of the scene is in focus. The camera is quite unsteady, with movement that lacks a clear, intentional pattern. Throughout the shot, animated, hand-drawn overlays appear and disappear; first, a red, squiggly line traces the woman's form, and later, blue and white scribbles are drawn over the water in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "In a forest with moderate brightness due to tree cover, a person stands on the rocks beside a shallow, flowing creek. The surrounding environment is dense with green trees and foliage, with the ground covered in dirt and rocks. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders. Animated, hand-drawn overlays appear throughout the clip; a red, squiggly line traces the person's form, and blue and white scribbles are drawn over the water's surface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
