  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a top-down perspective. Initially, a pixelated character with brown hair, a green shirt, and brown pants stands on a green putting mat in the center of the frame, which serves as the middle ground. The character swings a putter, striking a white golf ball that initially moves to the upper right, hits the edge of the track, and then veers to the upper left before entering a black hole on the mat. To the right, a row of golf bags is aligned vertically, some featuring red designs. User interface elements are positioned at the bottom of the screen: an image of an \"ANTIQUE PUTTER\" is in the bottom left, a yellow power bar with \"12Y\" below it is in the bottom center, and an icon of a white golf ball with a red dot labeled \"MAT\" and \"0Y RANGE\" is in the bottom right. As the character putts the ball, the camera, from a top-down oblique perspective, is initially static but then smoothly follows the ball's trajectory, moving upward with subtle left and right adjustments. This movement reveals an older, white-haired man with glasses, wearing a blue shirt, seated in a chair in the upper part of the room, near shelves holding various items. The putting mat remains in the center, and the character is repositioned to the lower half of the frame. The camera shakes slightly when the ball lands in the hole. The wooden room's floors and walls provide an atypical setting for golf, enhancing the pixel art video game's unique environment. The UI elements remain fixed in their positions throughout the camera movement, maintaining a consistent interface for the viewer.",

    "Subject": "In a pixel art video game scene, a character with brown hair, a green shirt, and brown pants stands on a green putting mat inside a wooden room. The setting is atypical for golf, as the right side of the room is lined with several golf bags containing clubs, some featuring red designs. An older, white-haired man with glasses, wearing a blue shirt, is also present, sitting in a chair in the upper part of the room. The game's user interface is visible, featuring an image of a golden \"Antique Putter\" in the lower-left, a yellow power bar at the bottom center, and an icon of a white golf ball with a red dot labeled \"MAT\" in the lower-right.",

    "Scene": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an indoor scene with wooden plank floors and walls. In the center is a rectangular, bright green putting mat containing a white cup filled with clubs and a black hole. A pixelated character in a green shirt stands on the mat and putts a white golf ball, which travels with a blue trail. The view moves upward to reveal more of the room, including an older character in a blue shirt standing near shelves holding various items. Lined up along the right side of the room are several golf bags containing clubs, some featuring red designs. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left, an image of an \"ANTIQUE PUTTER\"; in the bottom center, a yellow power meter with \"12Y\" below it; and in the bottom right, an image of a golf ball on a mat labeled \"MAT\" and \"0Y RANGE\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
