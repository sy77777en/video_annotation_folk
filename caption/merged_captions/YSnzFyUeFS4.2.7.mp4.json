  "merged_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene is framed by the camera operator's arms in the extreme foreground on the left and right. In the left middle ground, a white sedan is parked along the street, with a group of stationary people standing on the sidewalk just to its right. In the center and right middle ground, several pedestrians walk away from the camera down the sunlit city sidewalk, including a woman with long, dark hair in a black tank top and light-blue denim shorts, flanked by a woman in a pink tank top and another in a white sweatshirt. Three men enter the frame from the right and walk behind the women; the man in the middle carries a black bag and wears a white T-shirt and black pants, while the man to his right is dressed all in black, and the man behind them wears a black hat, a yellow T-shirt, and blue floral pants. To the left, several other people stand on the sidewalk; one person is standing and looking down, while another man is smoking. The background is composed of multi-story buildings on both sides, with a prominent storefront and a red neon sign reading \"Artistic PIZZA\" in the right middle ground. The sun is positioned in the upper-left background, casting a bright flare and long shadows across the scene from left to right. The camera, shot with mild barrel distortion, captures the street scene with a slightly unsteady hand, panning slowly from right to left while tilting up, shifting from a level to a low angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field, capturing the late-afternoon ambiance of the sun-drenched city street.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a late-afternoon scene on a sun-drenched city street. The bright sun, positioned low on the left, casts a strong lens flare and creates long, dark shadows across the concrete sidewalk. Multi-story buildings with dark metal fire escapes line the street. On the right, a storefront features a red neon sign that reads \"Artistic PIZZA\" above large glass windows. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, and a white sedan is parked on the left side of the street next to a large, leafy green tree.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
