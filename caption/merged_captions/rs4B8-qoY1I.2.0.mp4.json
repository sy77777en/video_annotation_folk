The camera remains completely static, capturing the dashboard organized into several static panels. Three cards are positioned across the top of the screen: \"Your last report\" on the top left, \"Your subscription\" in the top center, and \"Tip for you\" on the top right. Below these, three numerical counters are located in the center-left, center, and center-right of the frame; the numbers within them rapidly increase. The \"TOTAL DATA BROKERS\" count rises from 36 to 102, \"LISTINGS REVIEWED\" from 211 to 593, and \"DATA BROKERS WITH YOUR INFO\" from 21 to 59. In the lower half of the screen, a bar chart titled \"Listings Reviewed\" is situated on the bottom left, and a multi-colored donut chart labeled \"Your exposed data\" is on the bottom right, divided into segments with percentage labels. A cursor enters the frame, moves to the \"View Report\" button within the top-left card, and clicks it. A vertical navigation menu remains static on the far left throughout the shot. The dashboard features a dark mode theme with white and colored text, and the scene is a screen recording of a software or system interface displaying data visualizations and information.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
