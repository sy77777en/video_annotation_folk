Positioned on top of this background, a glowing white rectangular graphic is centered in the middle of the frame, displaying text and three circular images: a person in a red jacket on a snowy mountain peak, three hot air balloons in shades of orange, yellow, and dark colors floating against a blue sky, and a vibrant purple and orange sunset. Below this graphic, a black banner with white text reads \"80000hours.org/fern.\" On the left side, a vertical column of small, semi-transparent cubes is arranged, gradually darkening from top to bottom until they turn black. The camera, positioned straight-on, slowly zooms out from the central graphic advertising a career guide, causing all elements to shrink within the frame. As it pulls back, the vertical column of cubes on the left side of the screen darkens sequentially, turning black one by one from top to bottom. In the top right corner, a small black rectangular overlay displays the white letters \"AD.\"",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a static digital advertisement on a dark gray background. At the center is a glowing white rectangular graphic containing text and three circular images arranged vertically. The top image features a person in a red jacket on a snowy mountain peak. The middle image displays three hot air balloons in shades of orange, yellow, and dark colors floating against a blue sky. The bottom image captures a purple and orange sunset. Below this graphic, a black banner with white text reads \"80000hours.org/fern\". Along the left side of the screen, a vertical column of small, translucent cubes gradually darkens from top to bottom as the camera zooms out.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly zooms out from a static digital advertisement. As it pulls back, a vertical column of small, semi-transparent cubes on the left side of the screen darkens sequentially, turning black one by one from top to bottom.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds against a dark gray gradient background as the camera slowly zooms out. In the center, a large, white rectangular panel glows, displaying text and three circular images: a person on a snowy mountain, three hot air balloons in shades of orange, yellow, and darker tones set against a blue sky, and a vibrant purple and orange sunset. To the left of this central panel, a column of small, semi-transparent cubes is arranged in a somewhat irregular pattern, gradually darkening from top to bottom until they turn black. In the top right corner, a small black rectangular overlay displays the white letters \"AD.\" Below the white rectangular panel, the text \"80000hours.org/fern\" is prominently displayed, not as an overlay.",
    "Spatial": "The scene features a dark gray background as the base layer. Positioned on top of this background, a glowing white rectangular graphic is centered in the middle of the frame, with a black banner directly below it. On the left side, a vertical column of semi-transparent cubes is arranged, gradually darkening from top to bottom until they turn black. The camera, positioned straight-on, slowly zooms out, causing all elements to shrink within the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
