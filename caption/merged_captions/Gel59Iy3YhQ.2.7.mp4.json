  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot with no main subject, emphasizing the natural environment. It begins from a first-person perspective inside a dark cave, with the rocky entrance framing a view of a river valley. The camera, slightly unsteady and at eye-level, moves forward, exiting the cave and following a path. As it emerges, the cave walls recede, revealing a path and grassy riverbank in the foreground. The river flows from the background through the center of the frame and into the foreground, flanked by reddish-brown rock formations and pine trees in the middle and background on both sides. The upper half of the frame features a turquoise sky and clouds, while the lower middle ground includes riverbank grass, the river, and mist. The camera maintains an eye-level height throughout the forward movement, revealing a serene, stylized landscape of a misty river flowing through a valley. The scene is characterized by sunlit rocky cliffs and evergreen trees under a muted sky. The perspective emerges from a dark, rocky cave to reveal a tranquil valley. A gentle river, shrouded in a low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks and reddish-brown rock formations. The scene is bordered by a forest of tall, green pine trees under a soft, cloudy sky, all rendered in a warm, painterly art style. The scene opens onto a valley where a gentle river, shrouded in low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks. The valley is enclosed by reddish-brown, low-poly rock formations and hills dotted with green evergreen trees. A warm light illuminates the landscape under a muted teal sky with stylized clouds, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon.",

    "Motion": "This video clip features a camera moving forward out of a dark cave. It reveals a serene, stylized landscape of a misty river flowing through a valley. The scene is characterized by sunlit rocky cliffs and evergreen trees under a muted sky.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, emerges from a dark, rocky cave into a stylized Wyoming wilderness. The scene opens onto a valley where a gentle river, shrouded in low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks. The valley is enclosed by reddish-brown, low-poly rock formations and hills dotted with green evergreen trees. A warm light illuminates the landscape under a muted teal sky with stylized clouds, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The perspective moves in a nearly straight line, emerging from the cave and progressing directly from the land towards the river, revealing more of the tranquil, misty scenery.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
