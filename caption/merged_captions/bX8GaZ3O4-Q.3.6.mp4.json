  "merged_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an interior room, with the camera positioned at a low, hip-level angle looking slightly up at the scene, captured with a fixed Dutch tilt. The foreground is framed by the dark silhouettes of chairs on the bottom left and bottom right, appearing slightly blurred. A large desk occupies the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the frame. Behind the desk on the left side of the frame, a window serves as the primary light source, with a tall lamp positioned next to it. Various items, including a decanter, papers, and a small golden box, are arranged on the desk's surface in the middle ground. An ornate, gold-framed portrait painting is centered on the wall behind the desk, and another window is visible in the right background. The background is composed of the dark night sky visible through the windows. The room is dimly lit, with a strong beam of cool blue light emanating from the window on the left, illuminating the desk and revealing a pattern of bullet holes in the window against the night sky. A butterfly and a frog move across the desk sequentially before disappearing from the frame. Subsequently, the two table lamps illuminate, lighting up the entire room. The focus is on establishing a mysterious and quiet atmosphere, using the environment and lighting to set a specific mood rather than highlighting a particular object or character.",

    "Camera": "This is a static shot from a low, hip-level angle, with a fixed Dutch tilt. The camera captures the dimly lit room in sharp detail, though the foreground appears slightly blurred.",
    "Subject": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, opulent room at night. A strong beam of cool blue light emanates from a window on the left, illuminating a desk laden with a crystal decanter, a small golden box, and scattered papers. A tall, slender ornament is part of the base of an upright table lamp beside the window. The view outside the window reveals a dark sky with a series of bullet holes on the window. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is on establishing a mysterious and quiet atmosphere, using the environment and lighting to set a specific mood rather than highlighting a particular object or character.",
    "Motion": "This is a static scenery shot of a dark, opulent room, bathed in a deep blue light. The central focus is on a desk, which holds a decanter, a small box, and the base of a toppled table lamp. A beam of light from a window on the left illuminates the scene, revealing a pattern of bullet holes in the window against a night sky. A butterfly and a frog move across the desk sequentially before disappearing from the frame. Subsequently, the two table lamps illuminate, lighting up the entire room.",
    "Scene": "The scene is a dimly lit, opulent room at night, viewed from a low angle. A strong beam of cool, blue light shines from a window on the left, illuminating a large, dark desk. On the desk sits a glass decanter, a small gold-colored box, white papers that appear blue due to the lighting, and a tall, dark lamp with the blue light emanating from bullet holes in the window. Behind the desk, an ornate, gold-framed portrait painting hangs on the wall. The window on the left is framed by a pink curtain, and outside, the sky is dark. The foreground is dominated by the dark silhouette of a chair back, and the majority of the room remains in deep shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
