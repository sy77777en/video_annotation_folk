  "merged_caption": "This video showcases an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the environment as the central focus. Dark storm clouds dominate the middle ground and background, extending downwards. Below, a glowing horizon line with silhouetted mountains is visible in the background. In the foreground, two parallel highways start at the bottom left and bottom right, converging toward the center as they stretch into the background, creating a sense of depth. Sheets of rain and flashes of lightning periodically appear in the background, descending from the clouds. As the scene progresses, long light trails from vehicles emerge on both highways, moving from the foreground toward the center background. The camera maintains a level position, offering an expansive view of the scenery. This is a static, aerial-level time-lapse video. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the roads to the distant storm sharp. This time-lapse video captures a dramatic thunderstorm over a vast, open landscape at dusk, where two parallel highways stretch towards the horizon, illuminated by a warm, orange glow. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of dark purple and blue storm clouds, with sheets of rain visible in the distance. Brilliant flashes of lightning periodically illuminate the clouds from within, casting a dramatic pink and purple light across the sky, while the movement of the clouds and the light trails from cars on the highway indicate the passage of time. At night, a massive storm system with dark, turbulent purple clouds looms over a vast, arid landscape. In the distance, sheets of rain are illuminated by an orange and pink glow on the horizon. Bright flashes of lightning periodically light up the clouds and strike the ground. Below, two parallel asphalt highways stretch into the distance, and as the storm progresses, long, bright streaks of light from vehicle headlights appear on both roads, indicating motion in a time-lapse.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, open highway at dusk or night. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject, instead focusing on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural event, making the environment itself the central focus. Turbulent, dark purple storm clouds dominate the sky, from which sheets of rain descend and brilliant forks of lightning strike the ground, illuminating the entire scene in flashes of pink and white. Below the storm, the horizon glows with a warm orange and pink light, while the headlights of distant cars on the parallel highways create long, glowing light trails that stretch into the heart of the tempest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
