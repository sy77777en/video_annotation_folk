  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a green uniform, including a green hat with red lettering, a dark green vest, green pants, and a white short-sleeved shirt, positioned on the left side of the frame, near a window in the foreground. He is speaking on a phone, holding it to his ear with his right hand while his left hand is on his hip, and leans slightly toward the window. The office environment surrounds him, with a desk cluttered with papers and a vintage lamp in the lower right corner of the frame. A red chair is situated in the lower center of the frame, and clipboards hang on the wall in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly moves to the right, transitioning from the man, who turns his head to the right and speaks, to a view of a green door labeled 'COACH' and a window. The camera continues to move right through a hallway, revealing a new scene that showcases a kitchen area. This area features gray cabinets at the top and a countertop filled with neatly arranged dishes, a green bowl, a brown bowl, a stack of plates, and a few containers in the bottom. A window is visible on the right, allowing natural light into the space. The camera maintains its height, now capturing the kitchen at eye level, emphasizing the shift from the office to the kitchen. The transition is smooth, focusing on the spatial layout and elements of both settings, with the walls mostly light green and the upper section dark green, creating a cohesive backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
