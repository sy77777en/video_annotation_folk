  "merged_caption": "This is a static wide shot of scenery with no main subject. The scene is framed by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground, occupying the left and right sides of the frame. In the background, a dark, rocky creek flows from the top center towards the bottom center. The creek is situated between steep, shaded banks covered in moss and vegetation. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down into the ravine. The camera, which is slightly unsteady, is focused on the stream in the midground, leaving the foliage in the foreground blurred. The overall scene is peaceful and natural, capturing a view of a shallow, rocky creek flowing through a lush, green forest. The perspective is from above, looking down into a shaded ravine, with out-of-focus foliage in the foreground creating a natural frame around the dark, rippling water. The composition emphasizes the feeling of peeking into a hidden, natural space rather than highlighting a specific object. The scene is framed by out-of-focus green leaves in the foreground on both the left and right. The creek, filled with dark water, flows gently over a bed of dark, rounded rocks. The steep, earthy banks are covered in moss and other dark green vegetation under the shade of the forest canopy.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
