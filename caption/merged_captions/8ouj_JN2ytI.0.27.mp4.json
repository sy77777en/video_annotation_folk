  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, focusing on the vast urban scenery. In the foreground, tall skyscrapers frame the shot on the left, right, and bottom. The middle ground is occupied by a dense urban grid and a parking lot, where multiple explosions erupt at street level, sending smoke plumes upward. In the background, a distant city skyline is visible across a body of water, positioned at the top of the frame. The entire scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down upon the metropolis. The camera moves smoothly forward over the cityscape, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire urban landscape in sharp view. This is an extreme wide, aerial shot of a city skyline, which appears to be New York City. Multiple explosions erupt on the ground, sending up plumes of smoke and debris. The scene overlooks a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers, with a major highway and a large body of water visible in the distance, separating the city from another skyline on the horizon. The long shadows cast by the buildings suggest either early morning or late afternoon. Throughout the urban grid, multiple explosions erupt at street level, sending plumes of dark smoke billowing upwards. The focus is not on a single subject but on the vast scale of the city and the widespread chaos, emphasizing the environmental destruction rather than a specific focal point. The scene is dominated by towering skyscrapers under a hazy, golden sky, with a distant skyline visible across a body of water. The camera moves forward, capturing the scene from a high vantage point.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle view of a sprawling metropolis under a hazy, sunlit sky. The scene overlooks a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers, with a major highway and a large body of water visible in the distance, separating the city from another skyline on the horizon. The long shadows cast by the buildings suggest either early morning or late afternoon. At street level, multiple explosions erupt simultaneously, sending plumes of grey smoke and dust billowing up between the tall buildings and across a parking lot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
