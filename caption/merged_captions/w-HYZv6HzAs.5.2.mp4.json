  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a Black man with a shaved head standing in the center of a light-colored wooden stage in the middle ground, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience are visible across the bottom of the frame, seated and facing the stage. Behind the man, in the middle ground, a large \"TEDx Ryerson\" sign is positioned, with a stylized city skyline silhouette illuminated with blue lights against a dark backdrop. The stage is dimly lit, with spotlights focused on the speaker and the background elements. The man gestures with his hands while speaking, then walks from the center of the stage toward the left, continuing to gesture. After a few steps, he stops and spreads his arms wide. The shot freezes at the moment when his arms are outstretched. The camera, at a level angle and with deep focus, smoothly pans to the left, tracking the speaker as he walks across the stage and remains at the subject's level.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a Black man who appears to have a shaved head, with a smooth scalp and slightly darker areas on the sides indicating some remaining hair roots. He is standing on a wooden stage, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. Throughout the video, he gestures with his hands and walks around the stage as he speaks. In the foreground, the silhouetted figures of an audience are seen from behind, sitting in rows and facing the stage.",
    "Motion": "A man stands on a wooden stage, gesturing with his hands while speaking. He then walks from the center of the stage toward the left, continuing to gesture. After a few steps, he stops and spreads his arms wide. The shot freezes at the moment when his arms are outstretched. In the foreground, the silhouetted audience remains seated and still.",
    "Scene": "A man stands on a light-colored wooden stage in front of a large sign that reads \"TEDx Ryerson\" in red and white letters. Behind the sign, a stylized city skyline silhouette is illuminated with blue lights against a dark backdrop. The stage is dimly lit, with spotlights focused on the speaker and the background elements. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience can be seen watching the presentation from their seats.",
    "Spatial": "A wide shot frames a man standing in the center of a stage in the middle ground. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience are visible across the bottom of the frame. Behind the man, in the middle ground, a large \"TEDx Ryerson\" sign is positioned, with a stylized city skyline in the background. The man initially walks from the center towards the left side of the stage, then stops and opens his arms wide. The shot freezes at the moment when his arms are outstretched. The camera pans left, following the movement of the subject, and remains at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
