  "merged_caption": "This full shot begins with the front half of a cyclist and his bike framed in the left foreground. The cyclist, wearing a Red Bull helmet that is red and blue, a gray T-shirt, and black pants, rides a bright orange mountain bike with dark and green wheels. A large rock dominates the right foreground, with a beached boat positioned in the center-left middle ground. The boat has a blue hull, a white cabin, and a red buoy attached to its stern. In the background, two stone seawalls are visible, creating an opening to the water under a cloudy sky. The cyclist moves quickly from left to right across the frame on a sandy, uneven surface, ascending a 45-degree dirt slope on the right side of the foreground. As the cyclist rides up the slope, the camera, initially positioned at the subject's level, moves smoothly and slowly from left to right, changing to a position below the subject. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the background harbor. The cyclist briefly appears in full before ascending the dirt mound in the right foreground and exiting from the top-right corner. The scene is set at a stone harbor during low tide, revealing a muddy, rocky shoreline. A small sailboat with a blue and white hull rests on the damp ground.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a Red Bull helmet that is red and blue, a gray T-shirt, and black pants rides a bright orange mountain bike with dark and green wheels, moving from left to right up a 45-degree dirt slope. In the midground, a small boat with a blue hull, a white cabin, and a red buoy attached to its stern is beached at a slight angle.",
    "Motion": "A person on a mountain bike rides quickly from left to right across the foreground on a sandy, uneven surface, ascending a 45-degree dirt slope on the right side of the foreground.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set at a stone harbor during low tide, revealing a muddy, rocky shoreline. A small sailboat with a blue and white hull rests on the damp ground. In the background, two large sea walls built from stone blocks create an opening to the water under a cloudy sky. A large, weathered rock is positioned in the right foreground, while a person on an orange bicycle with a green front wheel moves across the scene from the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
