  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot frames a modified car engine from an elevated perspective. A large turbocharger with a silver-colored compressor housing and a woven carbon fiber heat shield is positioned in the bottom foreground, while the green engine valve cover with the words \"BMW M Power\" written in silver occupies the center-left of the middle ground. To the right of the valve cover, a silver radiator stands vertically in the middle ground. The dark body of the car frames the scene from the bottom and right foreground and the right middle ground. The video features a dynamic view of the car engine, with the camera smoothly advancing forward and downward while tilting upward. From a high, eye-level angle, the camera executes a very smooth movement, maintaining a shallow depth of field, keeping the green BMW M Power engine in the midground in sharp focus. The camera performs a very slow and subtle push-in, gradually tightening the framing on the engine components. The scene is set outdoors during sunrise or sunset, with the warm, golden light reflecting off the car's glossy paint and the metallic engine components. Various black hoses and silver pipes connect the components, adding to the complexity of the engine bay. The open hood reveals a highly modified engine, with the most prominent feature being the sparkly, textured green valve cover with raised silver \"BMW M Power\" lettering. The surrounding body of the car is painted a dark, glossy green, though additional angles or clearer visuals would help better showcase this feature.",

    "Subject": "A close-up view reveals a highly modified car engine inside an open engine bay. The engine features a prominent, textured, metallic green valve cover with the words \"BMW M Power\" written in silver. In the foreground, a large turbocharger with a silver-colored compressor housing is visible, its intake partially covered by a woven carbon fiber heat shield. Various black hoses and silver pipes connect the components, and a silver radiator is situated in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
