  "merged_caption": "This video is captured from a first-person perspective, with the cyclist's helmet consistently occupying the bottom foreground of the frame. The helmet features a prominent red and white \"Red Bull\" logo on a black and silver surface. Initially, the scene is framed to show a wide grassy area during the day under a cloudy sky, with a crowd behind a white barrier in the middle ground on the left and behind a red barrier that curves from the center to the right. A tall blue tower with a platform on top is visible in the background, positioned towards the center-left. The camera, mounted on the cyclist's helmet, moves forward quickly and unsteadily across the grassy field, approaching two men who are initially small figures in the center of the middle ground. One man, with light skin, short brown hair, and some facial scruff, wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt and holds a professional video camera with both hands. Standing beside him is another light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a dark t-shirt and a baseball cap, who holds a long boom pole with a large, furry microphone at the end. The forward motion causes the men to grow larger in the frame, and they remain fully visible until the end of the video. At that point, the camera gets too close, causing them to be partially seen in the lower right corner. The camera maintains a height level with the subjects it approaches, panning slightly left midway through. The shot, which features mild barrel distortion, begins at a high angle before transitioning to a level angle. A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, the front of a vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view, with a pair of hands in black and white gloves gripping the handlebars. The rider's helmet features a prominent red and white \"Red Bull\" logo on a black and silver surface. The vehicle approaches two men standing on a grassy field. One man, who has light skin, short brown hair, and some facial scruff, wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt and holds a professional video camera with both hands. Standing beside him is another light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a dark t-shirt and a baseball cap, who holds a long boom pole with a large, furry microphone at the end. A large crowd of spectators is visible in the background behind white and red barriers.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a vehicle moves forward across a grassy field, approaching two men, one of whom is filming with a video camera while the other holds a boom microphone.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves across a green, grassy field during the day under a cloudy sky. The area is lined with a low white barrier on the left and a similar low red barrier at the front and right. In front of the right barrier, there are stacked blue boxes featuring the Red Bull logo. A large crowd of spectators watches from behind the barriers. In the background, a tall blue tower structure with a platform on top is visible. Two men, one holding a camera and the other a boom microphone, stand on the grass. The view includes the top of the helmet with red and white \"Red Bull\" lettering.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
