  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman with medium-length dark hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a maroon vest over a dark-colored top with intricate gold embroidery, seated at a dining table in a dimly lit restaurant. Positioned in the middle ground center of the frame, she holds chopsticks and appears attentive and engaged, looking slightly to the side as if in conversation, without eating from the plate of food in front of her. In the foreground, several plates of colorful food and a glass of amber-colored liquid are situated, along with a small bowl, suggesting a dining setting. Partial views of another two persons' arms can be seen on both the left and right sides of the woman, indicating they are also seated at the table. The table, covered with a white cloth, spans across the lower portion of the frame. The background features dimly lit tables, dark wooden elements, and a painting on the wall, adding depth and contributing to the restaurant's warm, inviting atmosphere with a cozy ambiance. The ceiling has a decorative design, enhancing the traditional aesthetic. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective with a level angle and a shallow depth of field, focused on the woman in the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement, capturing the relaxed and intimate dining experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
