  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot captures two people from behind in the bottom center of the frame. In the middle ground, a wall displays large, dark blue Chinese characters, \"志存高远,\" on the top left and top right. A circular school logo is positioned in the top center, between the characters, featuring a stylized, mountain-like \"M\" shape and the English text \"NO. 2 SHIYAN HIGH SCHOOL\" along its upper edge, with smaller Chinese characters along the bottom. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the scene from behind them as they are situated underneath the wall signage. Filmed from a slightly unsteady, eye-level low angle, the camera focuses on the school sign in the midground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The video is presented in reverse-time, evident as the two people in the foreground, whose dark silhouettes are visible from behind, walk backward through a doorway featuring Chinese characters and a school's logo above it. Both have black hair; the first person has short hair, while the second person has longer hair. They appear to look up at the signage as they move backward, reaching up to touch the logo as they pass through. The camera pulls back slightly during the shot. The scene is set indoors, looking up at a plain, light-colored wall under cool, artificial lighting.",

    "Subject": "Large, dark blue Chinese characters, \"志存高远,\" are painted directly onto a light-colored wall, flanking a central circular logo. This logo features a stylized, mountain-like \"M\" shape and is inscribed with the English text \"NO. 2 SHIYAN HIGH SCHOOL\" along its upper edge and smaller Chinese characters along the bottom. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of two people are visible from behind at the bottom of the frame.

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, looking up at a plain, light-colored wall under cool, artificial lighting. Centered on the wall is a dark blue circular logo containing a stylized mountain-like emblem and the English words \"NO. 2 SHIYAN HIGH SCHOOL\" along its upper curve. Flanking the logo are large, dark blue Chinese characters. The view is partially obscured from below by the dark silhouettes of two people's heads looking up towards the signage.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
