  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a full shot, with the camera at the subjects' level. Initially, a large, heavily damaged metallic wreck, likely a submarine or ship hull, is positioned centrally and towards the bottom of the frame, resting on the sandy seabed in the foreground and lower middle ground. The wreck has a bluish-green appearance in the dim, murky blue water. In the middle ground, the lower part of a large, grey, mechanical lifting structure, composed of cylindrical pipes forming legs and a horizontal platform above, is visible, engaging the hull. The vertical pillars of this structure can be seen on the far left in the foreground and on the right in the middle ground, seemingly interacting with the hull. The camera is underwater, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus with a large depth of field. Initially positioned close to the wreck, the camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals upward while slightly panning left, progressively revealing the entire wreck and the lifting structure. As the camera ascends, the dynamic process of the structure securing the wreck is depicted, with the cylindrical legs gradually contracting to grip the damaged hull. This action slightly lifts the wreck in the process. As the lift begins, the entire assembly—wreck and lifting structure—ascends. The camera moves backward and upward, causing the seabed to recede to the bottom of the frame and into the background. This movement shifts the large mechanical lifting structure and the damaged metallic wreck to the center of the middle ground. The upward movement also brings the upper portion of the lifting structure into view; its horizontal platform becomes prominent in the upper middle ground, supported by vertical pillars to the left and right, with cables extending upwards from its center towards the top of the frame. The wreck remains centrally suspended by the structure in the middle ground throughout the ascent. Light filters down from the surface through the water. In the lower left corner of the frame's foreground, there is an overlay text that reads \"[2]; ©MapTiler.\"",

    "Camera": "The camera is underwater, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus with a large depth of field. Initially positioned close to the wreck, the camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals upward while slightly panning left, progressively revealing the entire wreck and the lifting structure.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a large, heavily damaged, metallic wreck, likely a submarine or ship hull, resting on the sandy seabed underwater. The wreck is crumpled and has a bluish-green appearance in the dim, murky blue water. Positioned over the wreck is a large, grey, mechanical lifting structure composed of cylindrical pipes forming legs and a horizontal platform above. This structure appears to be attempting to secure the wreck by attaching its legs around the damaged hull, as if preparing for or initiating a lift. The cylindrical supports seem to be slightly retracted, merely gripping the wreck rather than fully securing it. In the latter part of the video, the lifting structure is shown more fully, revealing a railed platform on top and cables extending upwards, indicating the wreck is being raised. Light filters down from the surface through the water.",
    "Motion": "The video opens with a full shot of a heavily damaged metallic wreck resting on the seabed. The camera then begins to move upwards, revealing the lifting structure with its cylindrical legs and horizontal platform. As the camera ascends, the dynamic process of the structure securing the wreck is depicted, with the cylindrical legs gradually contracting to grip the damaged hull. This action slightly lifts the wreck in the process. The camera continues to move upwards, showing more of the lifting structure as it secures the wreck. The final frames capture the lifting structure fully in place, with the wreck being lifted off the seabed.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an underwater scene where a large, crumpled, metallic wreck, likely a submarine, rests on a sandy seabed. The water is dark and murky, with light filtering down from above. A substantial, grey, metallic lifting structure, resembling a large claw or cradle with multiple articulated arms, is positioned over and around the wreck. This structure, supported by thick vertical pillars and a horizontal platform, has secured the wreckage. Descending cables from above secure the structure before the lift begins. The entire assembly, including the wreck and the lifting mechanism, is slowly ascending through the water. An overlay text at the bottom left corner reads \"[2] ; ©MapTiler.\"",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a full shot, with the camera at the subjects' level.

This movement shifts the large mechanical lifting structure and the damaged metallic wreck to the center of the middle ground. The seabed then becomes both the foreground and background, with the deep blue, shadowy underwater world forming the backdrop. The upward movement also brings the upper portion of the lifting structure into view; its horizontal platform becomes prominent in the upper middle ground, supported by vertical pillars to the left and right, with cables extending upwards from its center towards the top of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
