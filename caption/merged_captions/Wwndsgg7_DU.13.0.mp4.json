  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, where a silhouetted woman is running from the right side of the frame towards the center on a dark mountainside. This mountainside occupies the foreground and mid-ground, sloping upwards from the bottom-right towards the top-left of the frame. In the background, an electricity pylon is initially silhouetted on the upper left of the mountainside against the dark teal sky that fills the top portion of the frame, but later appears on the right side. A band of yellow-orange light marks the horizon in the background, visible behind a distant mountain range, primarily in the center-right. The scene is set outdoors in a mountainous region at dusk or dawn. As the camera tracks the woman running uphill, it pans left and rolls, which causes the entire scene to tilt and eventually positions the woman in the bottom-left corner of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, initially at eye level, then changes to a low angle due to camera motion. By the end of the video, a Dutch angle is present and varies as the camera continuously rolls counterclockwise. The blurry visuals in the dark environment make it difficult to determine the camera focus. The camera movement is very smooth at first, but noticeable camera shaking or rolling occurs towards the end. Her silhouette is set against a dimly lit background, making details like her clothing or facial features indistinct. A silhouetted figure stands on the slope, moving slightly as their hair appears to blow in the wind. The video concludes with a subtitle reading \"That was long.\"",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a woman positioned on the right side of the frame, running uphill along a slope. As she moves, she transitions into the center of the frame.

    "Motion": "The silhouetted woman begins to run uphill along a slope, moving from the right side towards the center of the frame. As she continues running, the camera tilts or rolls, causing her image to shift towards the bottom-left corner of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a mountainous region at dusk or dawn. A dark, silhouetted mountainside dominates both the foreground and mid-ground, sloping upwards from right to left. In the background, an electricity pylon is silhouetted against the sky. Behind the distant mountain range, a band of yellow-orange light marks the horizon, contrasting with the dark teal sky above. A silhouetted figure stands on the slope, moving slightly as their hair appears to blow in the wind.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
