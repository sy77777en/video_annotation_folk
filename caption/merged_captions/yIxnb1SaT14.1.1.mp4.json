  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a bustling city at night, likely Paris, captured from a high-angle aerial perspective. The scene is densely filled with Haussmann-style buildings that extend from the foreground at the bottom of the frame to the background at the top. A main street runs diagonally from the bottom left towards the upper right, intersecting with another street in the lower-left quadrant. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp, and performs a very slow and smooth zoom out, gradually revealing more of the urban landscape. Light trails from traffic are visible along these streets, primarily in the foreground and middle ground, appearing as long, glowing streaks of white and red due to a time-lapse or long-exposure effect, capturing the vibrant energy of the city after dark. The high-angle perspective looks down upon a complex network of streets and buildings, their windows glowing like scattered embers in the darkness. A major thoroughfare, illuminated by streetlights, cuts diagonally across the view, with traffic creating long, white and red light trails. At a busy intersection, storefronts cast a bright glow, and one building features a prominent vertical red neon sign. The focus is not on any individual element but on the sprawling scale and dynamic atmosphere of the city itself, conveyed through the intricate patterns of architecture and the mesmerizing flow of artificial light. In the bottom right corner, an overlay watermark reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video captures a bustling city at night from a high, aerial perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. It performs a very slow and smooth zoom out, gradually revealing more of the urban landscape.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant energy of a dense urban environment at night. The high-angle perspective looks down upon a complex network of streets and Haussmann-style buildings, their windows glowing like scattered embers in the darkness. Long-exposure photography transforms the moving traffic into brilliant streaks of white and red light, which flow along the roads, creating a dynamic tapestry of motion. The focus is not on any individual element but on the sprawling scale and dynamic atmosphere of the city itself, conveyed through the intricate patterns of architecture and the mesmerizing flow of artificial light.",
    "Motion": "This is a high-angle scenery shot of a bustling city at night, likely Paris, with its characteristic architecture. The camera gradually zooms out, enhancing the view of the cityscape. The movement of traffic on the streets appears as long, glowing light trails due to a time-lapse or long-exposure effect, capturing the vibrant energy of the city after dark.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, the scene captures a dense European city at night. The streets are lined with multi-story buildings, many with dark facades punctuated by glowing yellow windows. A major thoroughfare, illuminated by streetlights, cuts diagonally across the view, with traffic creating long, white and red light trails. At a busy intersection, storefronts cast a bright glow, and one building features a prominent vertical red neon sign. In the bottom right corner, an overlay watermark reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
