  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective framed by an overlay of orange and black edges, the scene is set in a dense underwater forest. A pair of gloved hands emerges from both sides in the lower foreground. The middle ground and background are filled with tall, stalk-like structures that rise from the sandy seabed, with some positioned on the left and right to form a central path. Glowing, turquoise-colored vines spiral around some of the stalks, adorned with small, glowing green and purple lights. The camera begins at a level angle, focused with a shallow depth of field on the player's hands and the nearby coral structures in the foreground. The camera then tilts downward to a high angle, smoothly moving forward and diving deeper into the sea, maintaining focus on the player's hands and the closest underwater features. As the camera advances, it navigates between the structures, revealing more of the environment. The stalks have a green, mossy texture and are illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence, including glowing green and purple spots, and strings of bright teal lights that wrap around them. Schools of tiny, glowing white creatures drift through the water, with clusters of small, glowing creatures drifting in the center and left middle ground. Occasionally, hands can be seen paddling outward from the center at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The camera, positioned at a height level with the mid-section of the surrounding structures, tilts downward and moves forward through the central path, navigating between the structures and revealing more of the environment. The view is framed by a dark orange border, suggesting a helmet or viewport, and a faint text overlay in the bottom left corner says \"Loopy Longplays.\"",

    "Camera": "The underwater camera begins at a level angle, focused with a shallow depth of field on the player's hands and the nearby coral structures in the foreground. The camera then tilts downward to a high angle, smoothly moving forward and diving deeper into the sea, maintaining focus on the player's hands and the closest underwater features. Camera movement is steady with minimal shaking, simulating the player's perspective as they explore the ocean environment.",
    "Subject": "This video offers a first-person view of a fantastical, bioluminescent underwater environment, framed by the orange-red interior of a helmet or viewport. The dark, aquatic landscape is populated with tall, greenish-brown, stalk-like structures that resemble giant mushrooms, distributed at different heights along the stalks. These mushrooms have flat, disc-shaped caps with dark green tops. Glowing, turquoise-colored vines spiral around some of the stalks, adorned with small, glowing green and purple lights. Schools of tiny, glowing white creatures drift through the water. Occasionally, a pair of gloved hands, part of an orange and black suit, is visible in the lower part of the frame.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the viewpoint tilts downward and moves steadily forward through an underwater, bioluminescent forest. Occasionally, hands can be seen paddling outward from the center at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. Throughout the scene, small, glowing white particles drift passively in the water, accompanied by some swimming bioluminescent creatures.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater environment resembling a forest. Tall, stalk-like structures with flat, orange-red-bottomed, disc-shaped mushrooms distributed at different heights along the stalks rise from a sandy seabed. The stalks have a green, mossy texture and are illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence, including glowing green and purple spots, and strings of bright teal lights that wrap around them. Clusters of small, glowing white creatures swim in the dark, greenish water. The view is framed by a dark orange border, suggesting a helmet or viewport, and a pair of gloved orange and black hands is visible in the lower part of the frame. A faint text overlay in the bottom left corner says \"Loopy Longplays.\"",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective framed by an overlay of orange and black edges, the scene is set in a dense underwater forest. A pair of gloved hands emerges from both sides in the lower foreground. The middle ground and background are filled with tall, stalk-like structures that rise from the seabed, with some positioned on the left and right to form a central path. Glowing vines are wrapped around one of the stalks, which shifts to the right middle ground as the camera advances. Clusters of small, glowing creatures drift in the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at a height level with the mid-section of the surrounding structures, tilts downward and moves forward through the central path, navigating between the structures and revealing more of the environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
