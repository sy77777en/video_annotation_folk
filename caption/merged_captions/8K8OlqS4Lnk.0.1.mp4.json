  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot featuring a vibrant primary rainbow and a fainter secondary rainbow arcing from the bottom left to the top right across the middle ground and background. Initially, a concrete fence is visible in the bottom right corner of the foreground, extending to the street's end in the background on the left. A prominent palm tree stands in the right middle ground, with other green trees spanning the middle ground. Power lines cross horizontally through the middle of the frame. The camera, positioned at street level, starts with a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot with deep focus. It first tilts upward toward the sky, changing from a level to a low angle to frame the rainbow. As the camera slowly tilts upward and pans right, the composition shifts. In the middle section, the treetops and a utility pole occupy the bottom of the frame. The camera then pans leftward and finally pans rightward while tilting downward to capture the full arc of the rainbow. By the end of the video, only a portion of the street scene is visible in the bottom right corner, along with the treetops at the bottom, and the rainbow extending from the top left to the bottom right against the grey sky. The scene is set in a tropical suburban environment, framed by lush green trees, including a prominent palm tree on the right. Below, a concrete fence with vertical posts runs alongside a paved road. Several black power lines crisscross the scene, and the faint silhouette of clouds is visible in the distant background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and the natural beauty of the rainbow, with the street-level environment serving as a familiar foreground to the celestial display.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a suburban scenery shot, capturing a magnificent double rainbow arching across a gray, overcast sky. The primary rainbow is bright and distinct, while a second, fainter arc is visible above it. The scene is framed by elements of a residential neighborhood, including lush green trees, a prominent palm tree on the right, a concrete fence, and power lines stretching across the view. The focus is not on a specific subject but on the overall atmosphere and the natural beauty of the rainbow, with the street-level environment serving as a familiar foreground to the celestial display.",
    "Motion": "A beautiful double rainbow arches across a cloudy sky in this serene video. The scene is set on a quiet street with a concrete fence, lush green trees, and a tall palm tree in the foreground. The camera gradually tilts upward and pans to the right, providing an enhanced view of the breathtaking natural display.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
