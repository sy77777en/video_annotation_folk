  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a clear liquid filling the frame. A small, round, orange ball with a vibrant color and a textured, dimpled surface, similar to the peel of a small citrus fruit, enters from the top center and moves downward, plunging into the liquid at the bottom of the frame. As it submerges, it creates a turbulent splash that fills the upper half of the frame, accompanied by large air bubbles. The orange sphere appears to bounce off the bottom before rising, spinning as it ascends. It eventually floats at the surface, with most of its volume submerged and a small portion protruding above the liquid. The object bobs up from the bottom to the center of the frame, where it remains fully visible, enveloped by numerous small air bubbles that cling to its surface and swirl in the water around it. The orange object is positioned in the middle ground, surrounded by bubbles in both the foreground and middle ground. The background is dark and indistinct. This slow-motion shot is captured from a static, level angle, though the camera is slightly unsteady. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, and the camera remains at the same height as the object inside the glass throughout the entire sequence.",

    "Subject": "A small, round, orange ball is shown plunging into and being submerged in a clear, bubbling liquid. The ball has a vibrant orange color and a textured, dimpled surface, similar in appearance to the peel of a small citrus fruit. As it enters the liquid, it creates a large splash and becomes enveloped by numerous small air bubbles that cling to its surface and swirl in the water around it.",
    "Motion": "An orange sphere plunges into a clear liquid, creating a splash as it sinks. It appears to bounce off the bottom before rising. As it ascends, the sphere spins and eventually floats at the surface, with most of its volume submerged and a small portion protruding above the liquid.",
    "Scene": "In a close-up shot, a round, bright orange object with a textured surface is submerged in a clear, effervescent liquid inside a glass container. The initial entry creates a turbulent splash with large air bubbles. The object then bobs near the surface as a multitude of fine bubbles continuously rise from below, clinging to the object and filling the transparent liquid. The background is dark and undefined.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
