  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a silver laptop placed on a wooden surface, capturing most of the laptop along with part of the surrounding area. The laptop is positioned in the center of the frame, with its screen displaying a digital map interface featuring detailed geographical features like roads, rivers, and green areas. The keyboard is visible in the foreground, while the wooden surface occupies the bottom portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high angle at eye level, smoothly zooms in with a shallow depth of field, transitioning from a medium shot to a close-up shot. This change in shot size focuses more on the laptop screen, which now nearly fills the entire frame. As the camera zooms in, a menu appears on the screen, offering options such as 'Directions from here,' 'Search nearby,' and 'Add a missing place.' The map then zooms out quickly, revealing more of the surrounding area, including city names and additional geographical features. The map on the screen shifts slightly to the right as a sidebar appears on the left side, providing additional information such as location details and navigation options. A bold blue line representing a specific path or direction appears on the map, highlighting its use for navigation or route planning. The camera remains positioned above the laptop throughout, maintaining a consistent angle that captures the screen and keyboard. The wooden surface remains in the background, though less prominent due to the closer framing. The video concludes with a clear view of both the map and the sidebar, emphasizing the laptop's sleek design and its function for route planning.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a laptop on a wooden table, displaying a digital map interface. The camera gradually zooms in on the screen, showing more details of the map, including roads, rivers, and green areas. A menu appears on the screen, offering various options such as 'Directions from here,' 'Search nearby,' and 'Add a missing place.' The map then zooms out quickly and noticeably, revealing more of the surrounding area, including city names and additional geographical features. Near the end of the video, a sidebar appears on the left side of the screen. As a location is selected, the contents of the sidebar change, and a bold line representing the path appears on the map.

    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor setting with a focus on a laptop placed on a wooden table. The lighting is bright, but it does not specifically indicate the time of day. The laptop screen displays a digital map interface with detailed geographical features like roads, rivers, and urban areas. The map quickly zooms out to reveal a wider view, then a sidebar appears on the left side. After this, a route is prominently highlighted in blue on the map. The laptop is silver with a black keyboard, and the table has a natural wood grain texture. The setting is simple, with minimal additional elements visible, emphasizing the digital map on the laptop screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
