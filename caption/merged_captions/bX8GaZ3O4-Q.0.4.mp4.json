  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot of a white, shiny leather oxford-style dress shoe with black laces positioned in the center-left of the frame, resting on a red, textured carpet that occupies the middle ground. A black, textured leather belt with a gold-colored buckle is draped over the top of the shoe in the middle ground. A small, bright green tree frog with a cream-colored underside and reddish-orange eyes enters from the bottom left, climbs onto the belt, and walks from left to right across the top of the shoe. The camera, from a smooth, ground-level perspective, initially holds a static shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the white shoe in the midground. As the frog jumps down onto the red surface in the right middle ground, the camera trucks smoothly to the right, tracking the frog's movement as it continues moving to the right, away from the shoe. The background remains out of focus with bright, warm light streaming in throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A white, shiny leather oxford-style dress shoe with black laces is shown on a red surface. A black, textured leather belt with a gold-colored buckle is draped over the top of the shoe. A small, bright green tree frog with a cream-colored underside and reddish-orange eyes appears from the left, climbs onto the belt, walks across it to the right, and then jumps off onto the surface.",
    "Motion": "A small, green tree frog appears from the left, climbs onto a black belt draped over a white shoe, walks across the belt to the right, and then jumps down onto the red surface before crawling away.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor scene set on a red, textured carpet, a single white patent leather dress shoe with black laces rests on the floor, with a black leather belt and its gold buckle draped over the toe. Bright, warm light streams in from the background, which is out of focus. A small, green tree frog appears, climbs over the belt and shoe, and then hops down onto the carpet before moving away.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot of a white shoe positioned in the center-left of the frame, resting on a red surface that occupies the middle ground. A black belt is draped over the shoe in the middle ground. A small green frog enters from the bottom left, climbs onto the belt, and walks from left to right across the top of the shoe. The camera trucks slightly to the right, tracking the frog's movement. The frog then jumps down onto the surface in the right middle ground and continues moving to the right, away from the shoe. The background remains out of focus with bright light throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
