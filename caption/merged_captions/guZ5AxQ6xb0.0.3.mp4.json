  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, the lower portion of a motocross bike and rider are framed from a level angle. The rider's booted foot, wearing white and blue boots with a black Nike swoosh, is planted in the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a mound of loose brown dirt. The rider also wears blue and white shin guards displaying the number \"60\" and a Nike logo on top, black pants, and blue and white gloves. To the upper left and center, the bike's front wheel and fork, featuring a white front fork with a red \"FIRELLI\" sticker, are also in the middle ground, with the tire partially buried in the dirt. A large, out-of-focus mound of dirt occupies the bottom left foreground, partially obscuring the view of the bike. The background in the top right is indistinct. The camera maintains a static frame throughout the shot, captured from a ground-level perspective with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the motorcycle's wheel and the rider's leg in the midground. In slow motion, the rider on the blue and white dirt bike accelerates forward, causing the rear wheel to spin and kick up loose brown dirt. The bike leans slightly as the rider maintains balance, skillfully maneuvering over the mound with the knobby tires gripping the uneven surface. The scene captures a dynamic outdoor setting on a dirt track, where the motocross rider navigates through reddish-brown terrain. The environment is characterized by loose, textured soil being kicked up by the bike's knobby tires, indicating motion and speed. The sunlight casts clear shadows, suggesting a bright, clear day. The focus is on the interaction between the bike and the terrain, highlighting the rugged surface and the rider's maneuvering skills.",

    "Scene": "The scene captures a dynamic outdoor setting on a dirt track, where a motocross rider navigates through reddish-brown terrain. The environment is characterized by loose, textured soil being kicked up by the bike's knobby tires, indicating motion and speed. The rider is equipped with protective gear, including blue and white boots, which contrast with the earthy tones of the track. The sunlight casts clear shadows, suggesting a bright, clear day.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
