  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man with a medium skin tone, wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband, walking down a tree-lined path. He is positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame, holding a small, reflective object in his left hand, which he appears to be looking at while walking. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that focuses on the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. As the man moves forward, the shot transitions to a medium shot, maintaining him in the center. On the left side of the frame, a metal fence extends from the foreground to the background, and a parked bicycle is visible in the middle ground. Trees and bushes line both sides of the path, with some in the foreground and others in the background. A few pedestrians are visible further back in the background, near the center-right of the frame. The environment is characterized by lush greenery, with trees and bushes flanking the path, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The sidewalk is bordered by a metal fence on one side, adding to the urban feel. The scene is well-lit, suggesting clear weather. As the man moves closer to the camera, the visible background elements are reduced, but the path and surrounding greenery remain in view. His posture is slightly hunched as he walks, and he seems focused on the object. The spatial dynamics focus on the man's forward motion along the path, contributing to a sense of everyday city life. The overall atmosphere is calm and leisurely, with a focus on the natural and architectural elements of the street.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man walking down a tree-lined path. He is wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband. He has a medium skin tone and is wearing sunglasses. The man is holding a small, reflective object in his hand. His posture is slightly hunched as he walks, and he seems focused on the object. The setting suggests a casual, outdoor environment.",
    "Motion": "A man wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband is walking towards the camera down a tree-lined path. He is holding a small, reflective object in his left hand, which he appears to be looking at while walking. The middle ground includes a bicycle parked on the left side of the path and greenery along the sides. The man continues to walk forward, maintaining his focus on the object in his hand.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting on a tree-lined sidewalk, likely during the day. The environment is characterized by lush greenery, with trees and bushes flanking the path, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The sidewalk is bordered by a metal fence on one side, and a bicycle is parked nearby, adding to the urban feel. The scene is well-lit, suggesting clear weather. The path is straight, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, contributing to a sense of everyday city life. The overall atmosphere is calm and leisurely, with a focus on the natural and architectural elements of the street.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man walking down a tree-lined path, positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame. As he moves forward, the shot transitions to a medium shot, maintaining him in the center. The camera is positioned at the man's level, ensuring he remains consistently at the camera's height. On the left side of the frame, a metal fence extends from the foreground to the background, and a parked bicycle is visible in the middle ground. Trees and bushes line both sides of the path, with some in the foreground and others in the background. A few pedestrians are visible further back in the background, near the center-right of the frame. As the man moves closer to the camera, the visible background elements are reduced, but the path and surrounding greenery remain in view. The spatial dynamics focus on the man's forward motion along the path."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
