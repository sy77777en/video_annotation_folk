  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle, first-person perspective, depicting a walk along a stone-slab-paved walkway in Porto, Portugal, during sunrise. The video begins with the walkway occupying the foreground and middle ground, leading from the bottom of the frame toward the center-background where the sun is rising. An old, multi-story building with a small balcony featuring a black metal railing and yellow flowers is positioned in both the left foreground and middle ground, while the large, grey, arched metal structure of the Dom Luís I Bridge dominates the right side of the frame, primarily in the middle ground. Other metal structures in the distance on the other side of the river, the blue sky, and the sun are in the background. The camera moves forward with a noticeable shake, offering a first-person perspective that enhances the dynamic effect of the sun's glare in the frame. As the camera moves forward along the path, the building on the left gradually moves out of the frame, revealing a stone wall and a short staircase leading to a lower area on the left side of the frame. The camera, which maintains a level angle, then pans slightly to the right. A red traffic light is visible on a pole to the right, relatively close to the bridge. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant bridge sharp. The bright sun in the background creates a strong backlight, casting long shadows and intense glare across the pavement toward the camera, emphasizing the quiet, early morning mood of the historic urban environment rather than a specific person or object.",

    "Camera": "This first-person video, shot from a shaky, eye-level perspective, moves forward along a stone slab street. The camera, which maintains a level angle, then pans slightly to the right. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant bridge sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a sun-drenched, empty stone slab street leading towards a large, intricate metal arch bridge. An old, multi-story building with a small balcony lines the left side of the street, while the massive structure of the bridge dominates the right. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the atmosphere and sense of place. The level-angle perspective and the bright, glaring sun create long shadows and a prominent lens flare, emphasizing the quiet, early morning mood of the historic urban environment rather than a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a dynamic scenery shot of a stone slab street in Porto, Portugal, next to the Dom Luís I Bridge. The sun is low on the horizon, creating a bright glare and casting long shadows. The camera moves forward with a noticeable shake, offering a first-person perspective that enhances the dynamic effect of the sun's glare in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a walk along a wide, stone-slab-paved walkway in Porto, Portugal, during what appears to be sunrise. The path approaches the large, grey, arched metal structure of the Dom Luís I Bridge. On the left, an old building features a mix of light and dark areas on its facade, with a balcony that has a black metal railing and yellow flowers. Bright, golden sunlight shines from the horizon, creating a strong backlight, casting long shadows across the pavement, and producing a prominent lens flare. A red traffic light is visible on a pole to the right, relatively close to the bridge.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
