  "merged_caption": "A small, four-lobed black outline appears in the center of the frame against a white background. This central shape subtly shifts before rapidly expanding and multiplying outwards, with new lines and organic forms sprouting in all directions to fill the screen. The animation depicts the rapid growth of an abstract, plant-like organism, initially appearing as a small, four-lobed shape with rounded corners. This shape quickly expands and multiplies, sprouting into an intricate and dense pattern of organic forms. The resulting black-and-white composition features swirling, vine-like lines, leafy structures, star-shaped figures, and several spherical shapes, all interconnected in an abstract arrangement that fills the space. The camera remains stationary, capturing this hand-drawn animation as it originates from the center and expands to fill the entire frame. The growth continues until it fills the frame with a dense, static pattern of twisting vines, leaves, and star-like figures. The final composition features twisting, vine-like lines, stylized leaves, small, round, fruit-like spheres, and scattered star-shaped figures, all rendered in a sketchy, black-ink style. The animation concludes with a static, dense, and intricate pattern of interconnected, hand-drawn organic shapes covering the entire frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
