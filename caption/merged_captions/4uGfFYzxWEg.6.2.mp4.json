  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a stylized white figure from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. This main subject, rendered in a solid, matte white color and appearing to wear a short-sleeved shirt, stands facing away from the viewer towards a wall of television screens. The central figure is flanked by other stylized grey figures: one in the background to the left front of the central subject, slightly turned towards him, and another to the right front, wearing what appears to be a hooded jacket and holding a hand to its face. Additionally, faint figures are visible on the left and right sides of the foreground. In the background, a wall of television screens occupies the upper portion of the frame, featuring two rows of monitors, each displaying blurry, repeated images of a person's face. The room is dimly lit, with the screens providing the main source of illumination. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the figures in the foreground in focus. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the central figure, who stands largely motionless, facing the screens, but its right hand is subtly moving to the left, while the surrounding grey figures do not move. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"[1,8]\". The scene is set in a dark, indoor environment, with the figures silhouetted against the glow of the screens, creating a stark contrast between the central white figure and the darker grey figures surrounding him.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the figures in the foreground in focus. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the central figure.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a stylized, low-polygon figure of a man, seen from behind in the center of a dark room. He is rendered in a solid, matte white color and appears to be wearing a top that might be a short-sleeved shirt. He stands facing away from the viewer, looking towards a wall of television screens. Surrounding him are other similarly stylized, low-polygon figures rendered in a darker grey. In front and to his left, another man-like figure is slightly turned towards him. In front and to his right, a figure in what appears to be a hooded jacket holds a hand to its face, while another figure is partially visible on the far right. The screens in the background show multiple blurry, repeated images of a person's face.",
    "Motion": "The stylized, low-polygon figures remain completely still in a dark room. The central white figure stands largely motionless, facing a wall of screens, but its right hand is subtly moving to the left, while the surrounding grey figures do not move.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, indoor setting, several stylized, low-poly figures stand before a large wall of television monitors. The figures, rendered in a simple, polygonal style, are seen from behind and are silhouetted against the glow of the screens.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
