  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a large pack of racehorses and jockeys is positioned in a horizontal formation in the upper center of the frame. They move from right to left along the curve of the brown dirt track, transitioning into an angled formation from the upper left to the lower right along the inside rail at the bend. A white inner rail and a strip of green grass are visible at the bottom left of the scene. The camera begins with a bird's-eye view and smoothly transitions to a high angle as it rolls counterclockwise while panning and moving to the left, tracking the group as they gallop at high speed around the wide turn. The horses maintain a relatively tight formation, with jockeys skillfully guiding them along the white railings on the inside of the track. The main group of racers is kept centered in sharp, deep focus. The jockeys wear brightly colored silks and helmets in various combinations, including a yellow and black checkered pattern, solid purple, blue with a yellow star, and red and white. The horses, mostly brown with one grey horse visible, run in a large pack. Static graphic overlays are present in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the frame. The lower-left corner identifies the race as the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" and lists several horses by number, name, and odds, such as #6 Messier at 7-1 and #3 Epicenter, the 4-1 favorite. The upper-right corner displays race statistics, such as \"1/2 MILE 45.36\" and \"3/4 MILE 1:10.34,\" alongside a television network logo.",

    "Subject": "A group of horses with jockeys competes in a horse race, viewed from an aerial perspective as they round a turn on a brown dirt track.

    "Motion": "A large pack of horses and jockeys gallops at high speed around a wide turn on a dirt racetrack. The camera rotates counterclockwise and pans left, tracking the group as they move from the right side of the screen to the left. The horses maintain a relatively tight formation, with jockeys skillfully guiding them along the white railings on the inside of the track.",
    "Scene": "A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures a horse race in progress on a wide, light-brown dirt track bordered by a white inner rail. Inside the rail, a strip of green grass is visible. A large pack of horses, ridden by jockeys in brightly colored silks, gallops along the track, moving from right to left. The scene includes several on-screen graphic overlays. In the top right corner, a gold-bordered box displays race statistics, such as \"1/2 MILE 45.36\" and \"3/4 MILE 1:10.34,\" alongside a network logo. In the bottom left corner, another overlay provides information for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY,\" listing the names, numbers, and odds of several horses, including \"EPICENTER\" marked as the \"FAVORITE.\" A thick white line runs down the inside of the track, and the horses run along it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
