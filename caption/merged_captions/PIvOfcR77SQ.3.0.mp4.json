  "merged_caption": "The video begins with the camera zooming in on a snowy outdoor setting. A red wooden cabin with a white roof is prominently featured in the center of the frame. The brightly colored sleds, including green, yellow, black, and red ones, are positioned against the cabin's wall, located towards the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The camera, at eye level with mostly a level angle, quickly zooms in, then slightly pans left and tilts down with noticeable shaking, indicating slightly unsteady handheld movement. As the camera zooms in further, the sleds become more prominent, filling the left portion of the frame. The focus shifts slightly as the camera highlights the sleds, which are next to a wooden post and a lantern, while still providing a clear view of the cabin and surrounding snowy landscape. In the background, another building is partially visible. Towards the end, a small snowplow starts to appear from behind the red house, moving from left to right, away from the house, clearing the snow. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The scene is calm, capturing the serene atmosphere of a winter day.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with mostly a level angle, utilizing deep focus. It quickly zooms in, then slightly pans left and tilts down with noticeable shaking, indicating slightly unsteady handheld movement.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing the essence of a winter setting. The focus is on the snowy environment, with an emphasis on the overall scene, including the snow-covered ground and buildings. The camera zooms in on a house, highlighting the colorful plastic sleds lined up against the red wooden wall, adding a touch of detail to the serene atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a red house covered in snow, with several colorful sleds leaning against the wall. The camera quickly zooms in on the sleds, which are green, yellow, black, and red, and are positioned next to a wooden post and a lantern. Towards the end, a snowplow starts to appear from behind the red house, moving from left to right, away from the house, clearing the snow.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a snowy outdoor setting featuring a small red wooden cabin with a white snow-covered roof. The cabin is situated in a wintry landscape with snow blanketing the ground. Brightly colored sleds, including green and red ones, are propped against the cabin's exterior. In the background, another building is partially visible. The camera then zooms in to the sleds, and there is a small snowplow behind the red cabin coming out to the right. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The scene is calm, capturing the serene atmosphere of a winter day.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with the camera zooming in on a snowy outdoor setting. A red wooden cabin with a white roof is prominently featured in the center of the frame. The brightly colored sleds are positioned against the cabin's wall, located towards the left side of the frame in the middle ground. As the camera zooms in further, the sleds become more prominent, filling the left portion of the frame. A small snowplow emerges from behind the house, moving into the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
