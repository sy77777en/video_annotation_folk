  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a painted wooden nesting doll, primarily blue with floral patterns and a depiction of a musical instrument on the front, and a hand interacting with it. Initially, the doll is positioned upright in the lower middle part of the frame, in the foreground against a plain white background. The minimalistic setting and even lighting highlight the doll's intricate design. A hand with light skin and slightly curled fingers enters from the right side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera is static at a level angle, focusing with ultra shallow depth on the Russian nesting doll. As the hand flicks the doll, the doll starts to topple to the left, transitioning from its upright position to lying on its side, moving from the lower middle part of the frame to the bottom left corner, remaining in the foreground. The hand withdraws after flicking the doll, and the doll continues its fall until it comes to rest on its side on the white background. The focus is on the interaction, emphasizing the doll's intricate design and the hand's movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
