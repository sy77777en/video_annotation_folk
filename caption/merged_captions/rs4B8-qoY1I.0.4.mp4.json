  "merged_caption": "This video uses a wide shot, capturing the entirety of an isometric game room from a tilted overhead angle, showcasing a 2.5D third-person isometric point of view game. A tall, winding orange and white structure resembling a spine is positioned in the center middle ground, crowned with arched details. An ornate, striped archway serves as an entrance on the left middle ground. The walls, featuring alcoves with static green, masked figures appearing as stylized guards or statues, define the background along the top and right edges of the frame. The checkered floor, rendered in black and teal, occupies the foreground and middle ground. A cartoon white dog character with large eyes and a simple, round form begins near the central structure in the middle ground and moves towards the right middle ground, descending the side of the central structure. Two peculiar orange, cone-shaped objects with white bases and jagged tops are initially seen near the center middle ground before moving towards the right middle ground, gliding aimlessly across the floor without following a specific pattern. After reaching the floor, the dog hops directly onto a stationary orange and white cube located in the bottom right middle ground. The cone objects continue to glide around after the dog lands. A white, ghost-like figure atop the central structure remains stationary throughout. Game interface elements, forming a heads-up display (HUD), are overlaid across the bottom foreground, showing icons for game items and corresponding numbers. The environment features tall bookshelves filled with white books and teal accents, with orange highlights running throughout the architecture. The camera position and framing remain fixed throughout the sequence, emphasizing the retro, pixelated graphic style and isometric perspective, creating a non-realistic, stylized world.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a 2.5D third-person isometric point of view game, highlighting the camera's angle, level, and focus.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases an isometric game environment with a distinct, limited color palette primarily featuring black, white, orange, and teal. A prominent, atypical structure dominates the center, constructed from stacked orange and white segments resembling a spine, crowned with arched details. The main character is a cartoon dog with large eyes and a simple, round form, adding a playful appeal to the scene. Static, green, masked figures stand within alcoves along the walls, appearing as stylized guards or statues. Animated, peculiar orange, cone-shaped objects with white bases and jagged tops move across the checkered floor. An ornate, striped archway serves as an entrance or exit on the left. An orange and white cube is situated in the right corner of the scene, adding to the environment's complexity. The scene's overall appearance is defined by its retro, pixelated graphic style and isometric perspective, creating a non-realistic, stylized world.",
    "Motion": "A white, cartoon dog character descends the side of a central, spine-like structure. Simultaneously, two orange, cone-shaped objects glide aimlessly across the checkered floor without following a specific pattern. After reaching the floor, the dog hops directly onto a stationary orange and white cube in the far right corner. The cone objects continue to glide around after the dog lands. Green, masked figures within wall alcoves and a white, ghost-like figure atop the central structure remain stationary throughout.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows an indoor room rendered in a pixelated style using orange, white, teal, and black. The environment features a black and teal checkered floor, with walls formed by tall bookshelves filled with white books and teal accents. Along the walls, small teal figures stand in front of the shelves, and orange highlights run throughout the architecture. A white and orange striped archway serves as an entrance on the left. A tall, winding orange and white structure dominates the center. Throughout the video, a cartoon white dog character moves across the room, starting near the central structure and heading right. Two orange and white cone-shaped objects appear, initially near the center and later near the right wall, moving aimlessly without any discernible pattern. Overlays forming a heads-up display (HUD) are visible at the bottom, showing icons for game items and corresponding numbers.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
