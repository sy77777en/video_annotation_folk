  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, a tall, slender man with pale skin and spiky black hair, dressed in a long black coat, is positioned in the center of the frame, walking away from the camera down a subway aisle. The scene is set inside a moving subway car, depicted in a sketchy, angular animation style with light greenish-blue walls and a narrow central aisle flanked by rows of tan-colored seats. His large left hand is in the foreground, holding onto a vertical pole. As he moves forward, alternating the hand he uses to hold onto the vertical poles, it becomes his right hand that is in the foreground. The camera, from an eye-level, level angle, smoothly tracks forward, following the character from behind as he walks down the aisle. Other passengers are initially visible in the middle ground, seated on the left and right sides of the car. On the right, a seated man with a long face, grayish skin, and spiky black hair, wearing a blue hoodie, looks forward. Next to him sits a woman with long dark hair and a pale complexion, wearing a dark hooded garment. On the left, another passenger, a skeletal-looking figure in a green jacket, is also present. These passengers transition to the foreground and eventually move out of the frame as the camera advances, following the subject's movement. As the man in the black coat extends his right hand toward the car door, the shot concludes with a quick zoom-in as the character comes to a stop. Vertical metal poles are positioned along the aisle for support, and a set of doors is visible at the far end of the car.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly tracks forward, following a cartoon character from behind as they walk down the aisle of a train. The shot concludes with a quick zoom-in as the character comes to a stop.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of this animated video is a tall, slender man with pale skin and spiky black hair, seen from behind as he walks down the aisle of a subway car. He is dressed in a long, black coat. His right hand, which is disproportionately large and skeletal, is extended to grip a vertical pole, followed by his left hand, which is also large. Other passengers are visible in the stylized scene. On the right, a seated man with a long face, grayish skin, and spiky black hair, wearing a blue hoodie, looks forward. Next to him sits a woman with long dark hair and a pale complexion, wearing a dark hooded garment. On the left, another passenger, a skeletal-looking figure in a green jacket, is also present.",
    "Motion": "A man in a black coat walks down the aisle of a subway car, alternating the hand he uses to hold onto the vertical poles. As he moves forward, he extends his right hand toward the car door. The other passengers remain seated and relatively still.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a moving subway car, depicted in a sketchy, angular animation style. The interior features light greenish-blue walls and a narrow central aisle flanked by rows of tan-colored seats. A figure in a long black coat walks down the aisle away from the viewer, passing other seated passengers. Vertical metal poles are positioned along the aisle for support, and a set of doors is visible at the far end of the car.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
