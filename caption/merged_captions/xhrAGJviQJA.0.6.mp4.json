  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a Black man with short, afro-textured hair is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, holding the camera for a selfie-style perspective. He is smiling broadly, showing his teeth, and looking toward the camera while wearing a bright pink, short-sleeved t-shirt and a black watch on his right wrist. The man is running on a wide, paved waterfront promenade on a sunny day, which occupies the bottom of the frame. A metal and wire mesh fence with dark posts runs horizontally across the middle ground, separating the promenade from a large body of water. In the background, the dense skyline of Lower Manhattan stretches across the upper half of the frame under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. As the man runs towards the right of the frame, the background scenery moves towards the left. Initially, he smiles at the camera while holding it out in a selfie-style view, then turns his head to the left and faces forward, continuing his run with the city skyline and water moving past in the background. The slightly unsteady, eye-level shot is filmed from a high angle with a fixed Dutch angle. Using a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, the camera tracks the man running from the side by moving and panning to the right, maintaining the subject's level throughout.",

    "Subject": "A Black man with short, afro-textured hair is shown from the knees up in a selfie-style view. He is smiling broadly, showing his teeth, and looking toward the camera. He is wearing a bright pink, short-sleeved t-shirt and has a black watch on his right wrist. He appears to be in the middle of a run, with his body angled.",
    "Motion": "A man runs along a waterfront promenade, initially smiling at the camera while holding it out in a selfie-style view. He then turns his head to the left and faces forward, continuing his run with the city skyline and water moving past in the background.",
    "Scene": "In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, a person in a pink shirt moves along a wide, paved waterfront promenade on a sunny day. A metal and wire mesh fence with dark posts lines the edge of the walkway, separating it from a large body of water. Across the water, the dense skyline of Lower Manhattan stands under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
