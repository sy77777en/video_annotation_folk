  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing a stylized humanoid figure, resembling a man, from the waist up, centered in the foreground of the frame. Rendered in a low-polygon style with a gold or brass-colored appearance, the figure lacks distinct facial features but has the general form of a human head and torso. It wears a collared shirt made from the same geometric shapes and material. The figure holds a dark, rectangular object, presumably a phone, to its left ear with its left hand, while its right arm is positioned down by its side. Initially, the figure faces slightly to the right, then gradually turns to face the camera directly. A glowing white waveform is positioned in the background, stretching horizontally across the center of the frame behind the figure, set against a dark, textured background. The text \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003)\" is displayed as an onscreen overlay in the bottom left corner, while subtitles appear sequentially as overlays in the bottom center, reading: \"I have to tell you that these suspicions have been referred to the police.\" The camera is at eye level and looks straight ahead, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It quickly moves forward to a medium close-up, focusing on the figure's upper body and head, which remains centered in the foreground. As the figure speaks, it gradually lowers the phone while slightly turning its body towards the camera. The background features a series of vertical and horizontal light bars, where only the intensity of the vertical bars changes. Subsequently, the view moves back to the medium shot, with the figure still centered in the foreground and facing forward. The camera movement is very smooth throughout these transitions.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and looks straight ahead, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It quickly moves forward to focus on the low-poly animated figure of a man on a phone, then slowly moves backward. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "In the video, a stylized humanoid figure, resembling a man, is shown from the waist up. Rendered in a low-polygon style, the figure has a gold or brass-colored appearance and lacks distinct facial features, though it possesses the general form of a human head and torso. It wears what looks like a collared shirt, constructed from the same geometric shapes and material. The humanoid is depicted holding a dark, rectangular object, presumably a phone, to its left ear with its left hand, while its right arm is positioned down by its side. Initially, the figure faces slightly towards the right side of the frame, then gradually turns to face the camera. The shot transitions from a medium view to a tighter medium close-up on the figure's upper body and head, before zooming back out to the initial medium shot.",
    "Motion": "The video features a low-polygon humanoid figure in a gold or brass color, initially holding a phone to its ear and speaking. As it speaks, the figure gradually lowers the phone while slightly turning its body towards the camera. The background is dark with a series of vertical and horizontal light bars, where only the intensity of the vertical bars changes. The figure's speech is subtitled, reading: 'I have to tell you that these suspicions have been referred to the police.'",
    "Scene": "A low-poly, golden-colored humanoid figure is depicted from the chest up, holding a dark, rectangular object to its ear, resembling a phone. The figure is set against a dark, textured background. In the lower middle part of the scene, an audio visualization pattern, consisting of a horizontal, glowing white waveform with vertical bars of varying heights, continuously changes to represent audio characteristics such as frequency and intensity against a dark brown background. White text overlays appear at the bottom: \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003)\" is in the bottom left corner, while subtitles like \"I have to tell you that these suspicions\", \"have been referred to the police.\", \"Right.\", \"And thus we [will] not for\", and \"the moment will be airing the program\" appear sequentially in the bottom center.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
