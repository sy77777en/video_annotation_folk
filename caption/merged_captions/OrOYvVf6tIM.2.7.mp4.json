  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young, light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. He wears a dark blue, long-sleeved shirt with a lighter-colored undershirt visible at the collar. The man leans forward over a cardboard box, which occupies the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. Initially, he uses a flashlight in his right hand to point into the cardboard box, but he puts it down at the start of the video. He then maintains the position of leaning forward and looking down into the box with a focused expression. The room is dimly lit, with a white-beamed ceiling visible in the background. A bright, cool-toned light, possibly originating from the indoor environment out of view to the top right, reflects onto his face, casting an upward glow and contrasting with the surrounding darkness of the interior space. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a low-angle, hip-level shot with a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the midground. It performs a slow, smooth, and slightly minor downward tilt, enhancing the sense of focus on the man's interaction with the box. His face is illuminated from below by the reflected light from the environment, adding to the visual contrast and highlighting his concentrated demeanor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
