  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man and a woman slow-dancing in the foreground. The man has voluminous, curly, light-blond hair and is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a dark shirt and bow tie, while the woman has long, straight, blond hair and is wearing a light-colored dress with sheer sleeves, with a pink and white floral corsage visible on her wrist. The camera initially frames the scene from behind the man, with the woman visible over his shoulder. Positioned at a low angle between hip and eye level, the slightly unsteady camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the couple as it arcs counterclockwise around them. As the couple sways gently from side to side, the woman rests her head on the man's shoulder, and they turn slowly in place. Their positions shift slightly as they continue to dance, with the woman occasionally lifting her head before lifting it off the man's shoulder at the end of the video. The camera orbits with them, maintaining their central position while shifting the viewing angle to reveal their profiles and faces at different moments. In the background, out-of-focus red and green lights are positioned in the top right and top left of the frame, casting a warm tone over the setting. Above the couple in the top-center, glittery star ornaments hang just behind them, and dark, vertically striped walls are occasionally visible in the background on the left. The scene is bathed in a soft, hazy glow from the lights, creating a dimly lit indoor space where the couple dances beneath the hanging, glittery star-shaped ornaments. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
