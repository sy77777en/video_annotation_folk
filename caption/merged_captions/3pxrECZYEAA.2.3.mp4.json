  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a stylized, animated bird with exaggerated features, positioned in the center of the frame. The bird, with a red body and orange accents, including its wings and tail feathers, has a straight, narrow beak ending with a wider rectangular section and purple eyes with black pupils, giving it a cartoonish appearance. It is in the middle ground, flying horizontally from right to left just above an orange, melting landscape that stretches across the center of the frame. In the foreground, a purple ground with small yellow, plant-like shapes occupies the bottom portion of the screen. The background consists of a dark, dense forest of stylized trees in shades of purple and blue, with green bushes behind them in the middle of the frame, while a blue canopy with a teardrop-like shape is located at the top. The camera, positioned at the creature's height, pans to the left, following its movement and keeping it centered as the composition becomes a wide shot revealing more of the expansive, surreal environment. The bird's wings are in various positions as it flaps them to maintain flight, and its beak is extended forward, suggesting it is gliding smoothly over the terrain. The background consists of purple and orange shapes with dripping effects, giving a surreal, dreamlike quality to the scene. This is a smooth side-tracking shot that follows the bird in flight, moving from right to left while slightly zooming out. The overall scene is vibrant and surreal, with bold colors and abstract forms, creating a psychedelic color palette that enhances the dreamlike quality of the environment.",

    "Motion": "A bird with a red and orange body and purple eyes is seen flying to the left against a backdrop of abstract, colorful shapes resembling a forest or jungle.

    "Scene": "This animated scene takes place in a surreal, outdoor landscape with a psychedelic color palette. The ground is a flat, deep purple surface from which small, yellow, plant-like shapes protrude. Stretching across the midground is a lumpy, orange terrain that appears to be melting, with drips hanging down towards the purple ground. The background is a dark, dense forest of stylized trees in shades of purple and blue, with light blue forms at the very top that also have a dripping quality. Behind the purple trees, green bushes add another layer of depth. A red, bird-like creature with a single large purple eye and a long, striped beak flies from right to left across the scene, just above the orange landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
