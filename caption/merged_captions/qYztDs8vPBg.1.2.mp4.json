  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up, overhead shot of a white surface filmed from a static, bird's-eye view, utilizing a deep depth of field to keep background elements in focus. In the foreground, a pair of light-skinned hands is centered, with the left hand holding a translucent, frosted rectangular block in the center-left and a gold-colored link-band watch. The right hand holds a black handheld diamond tester labeled \"SELECTOR II\" in the center-right, its metal tip pressed against the block. The tester is on, with its LED scale fully illuminated into the red \"DIA\" section, and two red indicator lights are lit, causing it to beep continuously. The person slightly rotates the block counter-clockwise while keeping the tester pressed against it before moving the tester away from the block. In the middle ground, a smartphone with its camera app open sits at the top-left, next to a metal piece with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it in black text on a white background at the top-center. A folding knife with a blue textured handle is positioned on the right side, with a silver digital caliper in the background at the top-right. A set of colored pencils and a small screwdriver are also arranged on the surface. Throughout the shot, both hands and the tester move slightly, maintaining the focus on the interaction between the tester and the block.",

A pair of hands holds a large, translucent, faceted block and a black electronic device labeled \"SELECTOR II\". The device, featuring an illuminated scale of lights and a metal probe, is pressed against the block, causing it to beep and its lights to reach the red section. In the background, a smartphone with its camera app open, a digital caliper, a set of colored pencils, a folding knife, and a small screwdriver are arranged on the surface. To the right of the phone, a metal piece displays a \"JerryRigEverything\" label with black text on a white background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
