  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a high-angle close-up that fills the frame with a grid of greenish-grey tiles, which appear curved due to a distorted perspective. An irregular, darker patch is located in the center of the frame. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the tiled surface sharp as it smoothly zooms out. The shot then transitions to a wide shot, revealing more of the surrounding environment. In this wider view, the tiled floor occupies the bottom and central portions of the frame, while elements like walls and railings become visible along the top and sides. Two metal railings are visible on the walls, following a descending staircase leading to the pool. Additionally, a body of water is visible in the top and top left sections of the frame, with slight motion due to the ripples in the water at the top of the scene. The camera's high-angle position, looking down on the scene, remains consistent throughout the transition. The lighting is dim and even, casting a soft glow across the scene, and the tiles are white, but the color of the light reflected on the water gives them a greenish appearance. The perspective is slightly distorted, causing the straight lines of the tile grid to curve gently towards the edges of the view. A dark, splotchy stain is visible in the center of the frame, while the only movement comes from the ripples of water at the top. The focus is instead on the eerie atmosphere created by the dim, green-tinged lighting and the abstract quality of the submerged textures.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a high, eye-level angle, featuring mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the tiled surface sharp as it smoothly zooms out.",
    "Subject": "This is a minimalist scenery shot capturing the tiled floor of a basin. A grid of dark, greenish-grey tiles, viewed from a high, slightly distorted perspective, dominates the frame, with a subtle, irregular patch located on the tiles near the center. The tiles are white, but the color of the light reflected on the water gives them a greenish appearance. There is no main subject in the conventional sense. The focus is instead on the eerie atmosphere created by the dim, green-tinged lighting and the abstract quality of the submerged textures.",
    "Motion": "The camera begins with a high-angle shot of the tiled bottom of a pool or basin and gradually zooms out. The grid of square tiles is slightly distorted by the greenish tint created by reflections from the water, which is present in the scene. A dark, splotchy stain is visible in the center of the frame, while the only movement comes from the ripples of water at the top.",
    "Scene": "A downward-looking shot captures a room covered in small, square, muted green tiles arranged in a grid. The lighting is dim and even, casting a soft glow across the scene. Two metal railings are visible on the walls, following a descending staircase leading to the pool. In the center, an irregularly shaped patch of moisture darkens several tiles, creating a distinct, splotchy pattern against the uniform background. The perspective is slightly distorted, causing the straight lines of the tile grid to curve gently towards the edges of the view. The scene is not entirely static; there is slight motion due to the ripples in the water at the top of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
