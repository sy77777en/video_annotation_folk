  "merged_caption": "This video is a low-angle scenery shot, beginning with an extreme wide shot that captures a completed skyscraper in the center-right middle ground and another skyscraper under construction to its left. The tops of older buildings are visible across the bottom foreground, set against a partly cloudy sky in the background. The camera, maintaining a deep focus, moves slightly unsteadily and quickly forward toward the tall, rectangular tower clad in dark, reflective glass, topped with a cylindrical structure and a spire. As the camera tilts upward to keep the skyscraper centered in the frame, the framing transitions to a wide shot, causing the two middle-ground skyscrapers to fill more of the frame, appearing larger and more central, while the foreground buildings at the bottom become partially cropped. The completed skyscraper is characterized by its modern design, while the skyscraper to its left is under construction, with exposed concrete floors and a large construction crane extending above it. The upward-looking perspective emphasizes the immense scale of these structures, with the tops of older, lower-rise buildings just visible in the foreground. The shot concludes with a slight lateral movement to the left, showcasing the architectural contrast and dynamic nature of a growing city, as the completed glass skyscraper stands next to the tall building still under construction. The camera is positioned below the structures, looking upward throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic view of a modern cityscape.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The slightly unsteady camera moves quickly forward toward a tall building, tilting up to keep it centered in the frame. The shot concludes with a slight truck to the left.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a moment of urban development. The composition is dominated by two towering skyscrapers set against a partly cloudy sky. Centrally positioned in the scene is a completed, modern high-rise with a dark, reflective glass facade that rises to a cylindrical crown at its peak. To its left stands another skyscraper in the process of being built; its dark, curved structure is still an exposed frame of concrete and steel, with a prominent construction crane visible at its very top. The upward-looking perspective emphasizes the immense scale of these structures, with the tops of older, lower-rise buildings just visible in the foreground. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the broader environment, creating an atmosphere of architectural contrast and the dynamic nature of a growing city.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dynamic view of a modern cityscape. The camera moves slightly unsteadily and quickly forward toward a tall building, tilting upward to keep it centered in the frame. The shot concludes with a slight lateral movement to the left, showcasing a completed glass skyscraper next to another tall building still under construction.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime urban scene features two prominent skyscrapers against a cloudy sky. In the center, a completed, tall, rectangular tower is clad in dark, reflective glass and topped with a cylindrical structure and a spire. To its left stands a curved skyscraper under construction, characterized by its exposed concrete floors and a large construction crane extending above it. In the foreground, the upper portions of older, shorter, light-colored buildings are visible, with the top floor of one appearing green.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a low-angle scenery shot. It begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing a completed skyscraper in the center-right middle ground and another skyscraper under construction to its left. The tops of older buildings are visible across the bottom foreground, set against a cloudy sky in the background. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning the framing to a wide shot. This movement causes the two middle-ground skyscrapers to fill more of the frame, appearing larger and more central, while the foreground buildings at the bottom become partially cropped. The camera is positioned below the structures, looking upward throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
