  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, showing two mannequin-like figures with smooth, featureless faces and a light blue, metallic skin tone from the waist up against a dark background. The figure in the light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark blue pants with a belt is positioned on the left side of the frame, holding a small, white slip of paper between its thumb and forefinger. The slip of paper has a green bar at the top and black text that reads \"PARK PLACE,\" \"$ 25,000 $,\" \"#821,\" and \"NEED/NECESITA B21, B22.\" The figure in the red short-sleeved t-shirt is on the right, with its right hand open and palm facing up, positioned to receive the slip of paper. Both figures stand on a dark surface with a subtle blue-green gradient. The camera, positioned at eye-level, smoothly dollies forward, transitioning to an extreme close-up shot that focuses on the small game piece held by the left figure's hand. In this final framing, the hand and the game piece occupy the left and center of the frame in the foreground, while the right figure's open hand remains visible on the right side in the middle ground. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both figures sharp. An overlay of white text appears in the bottom-left corner, followed by larger red subtitles displaying \"1989\" in the same corner. Throughout the video, the two mannequin-like figures remain stationary as the camera performs the dolly movement, emphasizing the hand-off of the small slip of paper.",

    "Scene": "In a minimalist setting with a black background, two faceless, metallic-skinned mannequins interact. One, dressed in a light blue shirt and dark pants, holds a small, white rectangular game piece. The other mannequin, wearing a red t-shirt, extends an open hand to receive it. The camera uses a dolly movement to focus on the game piece, revealing a green bar at the top and black text that reads \"PARK PLACE,\" \"$ 25,000 $,\" \"#821,\" and \"NEED/NECESITA B21, B22.\" An overlay of white text appears in the bottom-left corner, followed by larger red subtitles displaying \"1989\" in the same corner.

    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium shot, showing two figures from the waist up. The figure in the blue shirt is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the figure in the red shirt is on the right, both in the foreground. The camera then moves forward, transitioning to an extreme close-up shot that focuses on a small game piece held by the left figure's hand. In this final framing, the hand and the game piece occupy the left and center of the frame in the foreground, while the right figure's open hand remains visible on the right side in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
