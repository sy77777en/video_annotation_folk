  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins as a completely out-of-focus close-up, presenting abstract shapes of green on the left and white in the center and right. The scene starts with a completely blurred view, which gradually comes into focus through a slow rack focus effect with a shallow depth of field. As the focus sharpens, the camera captures a view of a waterfall cascading down a rock face, framed by the dark silhouettes of tree leaves in the foreground. The final composition reveals dark, silhouetted leaves and branches in the foreground, framing the top, left, and right sides of the shot, with some backlit green leaves visible in the top-left. The waterfall is positioned in the background, visible centrally through the gaps in the foreground foliage. The camera looks through the leaves toward the waterfall in a slightly unsteady, slow-motion shot, with the angle appearing to be either level or low. The interplay between the dark foreground and the bright background creates a sense of depth and makes the entire scene the subject of the shot. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of discovery rather than a specific object. The scene captures the bright, cascading water in the background, framed by the dark, silhouetted shapes of leaves and branches in the foreground. Some leaves catch the light to reveal a vibrant green color, while the white water cascades down a dark, rocky cliff face, creating a high-contrast natural scene during the daytime. The composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and the layered perspective of looking through the dense woods to the powerful natural feature beyond.",

    "Camera": "The camera captures the waterfall through silhouetted tree leaves in a slightly unsteady, slow-motion shot. The angle appears to be either level or low. The scene begins out of focus and performs a slow rack focus with a shallow depth of field, gradually bringing the leaves in the foreground into focus while the waterfall in the background remains blurred.",
    "Subject": "This is a nature scenery shot capturing a waterfall through the foliage of a forest. The video begins with a soft, out-of-focus view that gradually sharpens to reveal the bright, cascading water in the background, framed by the dark, silhouetted shapes of leaves and branches in the foreground. There is no single main subject because the composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and the layered perspective of looking through the dense woods to the powerful natural feature beyond. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of discovery rather than a specific object. The interplay between the dark foreground and the bright background creates a sense of depth and makes the entire scene the subject of the shot.",
    "Motion": "This scenery shot features a rack focus effect. The video begins with a completely blurred, abstract image of green and white. It then sharpens to reveal a view of a waterfall cascading down a rock face, framed by the dark silhouettes of tree leaves in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "The scene begins with a completely blurred view of green and white shapes, which gradually comes into focus. The final view looks through the foliage of trees towards a waterfall in the background. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of leaves and thin branches hang down, with some leaves catching the light to reveal a vibrant green color. Behind the foliage, white water cascades down a dark, rocky cliff face, creating a high-contrast natural scene during the daytime.",
    "Spatial": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins as a completely out-of-focus close-up, presenting abstract shapes of green on the left and white in the center and right. The focus then pulls to reveal the scene. In the final composition, dark, silhouetted leaves and branches are in the foreground, framing the top, left, and right sides of the shot, with some backlit green leaves visible in the top-left. A waterfall is positioned in the background, visible centrally through the gaps in the foreground foliage. The camera looks through the leaves toward the waterfall."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
