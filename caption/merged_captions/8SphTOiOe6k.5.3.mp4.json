  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a bustling street scene, capturing a diverse group of people walking along a pathway lined with shops. The camera is positioned at the height of the subjects, providing a first-person perspective. In the foreground, individuals are seen walking out of the frame from both sides at the bottom, indicating a flow of pedestrian traffic. The middle ground features more people walking in pairs or small groups, with some holding bags or drinks. Traditional wooden buildings with shop signs, a red vending machine, and a scooter are also in the middle ground, approximately located at the center. The background consists of the blue sky and clouds at the top of the frame, as well as the shops extending from the middle ground to the background on the left side of the frame. Trees with autumn foliage are visible on the left, adding color to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height and angle throughout, capturing the dynamic and lively atmosphere of the urban setting. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing a street view with deep focus. It moves forward with slight shakiness. Midway, it pans and trucks right to avoid a pedestrian, then pans left to realign with the street. A group of people strolls along a pathway lined with shops and trees, all wearing masks. Individuals walk back and forth, some side by side, others in pairs or alone, occasionally stopping to look at storefronts. The frame shows a street with vehicles on the left side of the sidewalk, while a row of shops lines the right side of the sidewalk and the far left side of the street. The overall scene is a steady flow of pedestrians navigating the area, with noticeable interactions and exchanges among them.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
