  "merged_caption": "The video is an extreme wide shot, with the camera at the subject's level. Initially, a stick-figure cyclist with a round head, a body composed of stick-like lines, and a small, pointed white hat is positioned on the right side of the frame, riding a simply drawn bicycle adorned with small, colored squares (blue, green, red) near its back on a thick black line that extends from the left edge. The cyclist moves from left to right across a long, slightly undulating black line, completing a clockwise circle and continuing rightward and downward along a shorter, upward-curving black line. The camera tracks the cyclist from a side view, moving primarily rightward and downward, with a subtle upward movement as the cyclist jumps. A black musical quarter rest symbol is positioned to the right of the center and slightly below the cyclist, while a black numeral \"6\" with an adjacent diagonal line is at the bottom center. These elements remain stationary as the cyclist rides past them. The cyclist proceeds rightward along two other, similarly curved black lines, while the paths remain stationary. By the end of the clip, the cyclist is moving rightwards on a central concave path segment, with a short, distinct line visible on the left side of the frame. The scene captures a minimalist environment against a pure white background, with thick, black, curved lines forming a path across which the cyclist moves. Other black, abstract shapes, including the musical quarter rest symbol and the numeral \"6,\" are visible, contributing to the stark, graphic landscape. The camera movement is smooth throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video features a stick-figure character with a round head, a body composed of stick-like lines, and a small, pointed hat that is white, riding a simply drawn bicycle. The bicycle is adorned with small, colored squares (blue, green, red) near its back. Accompanying this character are thick, black, hand-drawn lines that form an uneven path. Also present are a black, hand-drawn musical quarter rest symbol and the hand-drawn black numeral \"6\".",
    "Motion": "A stick-figure cyclist on a bicycle moves from left to right across a long, slightly undulating black line. The cyclist completes a clockwise circle and continues moving to the right and downward along a shorter, upward-curving black line. After traversing this second line, the cyclist proceeds rightward along two other, similarly curved black line. A musical quarter rest symbol and the numeral \"6\" remain stationary at one location as the cyclist rides past them.",
    "Scene": "A side-view video game scene captures a minimalist environment against a pure white background. Thick, black, curved lines form a path across which a small, stick-figure-like character on a bicycle moves from left to right. Other black, abstract shapes, including a musical quarter rest symbol and a numeral \"6\" with an adjacent diagonal line, are visible. The black lines constituting the terrain appear to shift, creating a sense of movement through this stark, graphic landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video is an extreme wide shot, with the camera at the subject's level. Initially, a stick-figure cyclist is positioned on the right side of the frame, riding on a thick black line that extends from the left edge. A black musical quarter rest symbol is positioned to the right of the center and slightly below the cyclist, while a black numeral \"6\" with an adjacent diagonal line is at the bottom center. The cyclist moves rightwards across the frame, occasionally moving downward and upward, while the paths remain stationary. The numeral \"6\" and its diagonal line do not transform, and the quarter rest symbol remains stationary. By the end of the clip, the cyclist is moving rightwards on a central concave path segment, with a short, distinct line visible on the left side of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
