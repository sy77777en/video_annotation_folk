  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a person with light skin, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a dark striped tie, holding a book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle\" with a maroon cover and gold lettering. The subject occupies the central area of the frame, with their upper body visible from the waist up, though their head is almost not visible. The person faces right and walks forward, maintaining their central position in the frame, with the book held tightly against their right chest with their right hand. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the person sharp while blurring the background. It moves slightly from left to right, tracking the person from the side, with the movement being slightly unsteady and some shaking. In the background, a yellow vintage car is situated in the middle ground, slightly to the right, and remains static throughout the video. The background includes a residential setting with a gray house, a blue house, neatly trimmed hedges, and greenery, which remains consistent and unchanging. The scene is set in an outdoor suburban environment during the daytime, characterized by clear skies and bright sunlight, conveying a sense of quiet suburban life. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the sunlight casting soft shadows on the ground. The spatial dynamics emphasize the subject and the book they hold, with minimal changes in their positioning relative to the camera.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
