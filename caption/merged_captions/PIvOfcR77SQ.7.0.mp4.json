  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from an eye-level perspective, presenting a tranquil, snow-covered landscape at twilight. The video begins with a snow-covered car in the left middle ground and a small, dark log cabin with string lights in the center-right middle ground. A larger building and a tree line are visible in the background under a cloudy sky, while a vast expanse of snow fills the foreground. From a smooth, first-person perspective, the camera walks forward while executing a wide, 180-degree pan to the right, revealing a snowy landscape with several buildings. The camera pans across several wooden buildings, including a log cabin and a red house, all blanketed in deep snow. A few cars are parked nearby, and festive lights adorn a small tree and one of the cabins, adding a warm touch to the cold, wintry scene. The camera then pans smoothly to the right, revealing a red building with two garage doors on the left and bringing a large red house with a lit Christmas tree into view on the right. The pan concludes with the red house positioned in the right middle ground, a lit path leading into the center of the scene, and another small wooden structure visible in the distance. The overcast sky is a mix of dark clouds and pale light above a distant tree line. Bare, skeletal trees stand against the cloudy, dusky sky, while a couple of parked cars and a snowmobile are partially buried in the snow. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the camera's sweeping motion is intended to capture the quiet, cold atmosphere and the picturesque quality of the entire snowy environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the setting.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a rural landscape blanketed in deep snow during twilight. The overcast sky is a mix of dark clouds and pale light above a distant tree line. The scene features several structures, including a dark log cabin with a string of warm lights on its corner, a red building with two white garage doors, and another red house with a lit Christmas tree outside. Bare, leafless trees are scattered throughout the area, and a dark sedan and a snow-covered car are parked nearby. A path with small lamps leads further into the property, where another small wooden outbuilding is visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
