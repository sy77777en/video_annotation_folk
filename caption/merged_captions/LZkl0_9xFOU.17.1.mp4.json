  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a faceless, mannequin-like figure with pale, artificial-looking skin and short, dark hair is positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame, wearing a brightly colored, short-sleeved tie-dye t-shirt featuring swirls of blue, green, yellow, and purple, along with blue jeans. Its arms are bent with clenched fists, suggesting motion. The figure is held in a static running pose, moving forward through a dimly lit area. To the right, the front of a dark-colored car occupies the middle ground, partially visible. In the middle ground to the left, green trash bins are visible, with a yellow bollard positioned in front of them at the bottom left. A yellow line on the ground extends diagonally from the bottom left toward the top right, indicating a paved surface, possibly a road or parking lot. The environment is cast in a cool, bluish light, and the background is blurred, indicating motion. The camera, positioned at a high, eye-level angle, smoothly arcs counterclockwise, using a shallow depth of field to keep the mannequin-like figure in the foreground in focus. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, reading \"[10].\"",

    "Subject": "A faceless, mannequin-like figure with pale, artificial-looking skin and short, dark hair is depicted in a running pose. The figure wears a brightly colored, short-sleeved tie-dye t-shirt featuring swirls of blue, green, yellow, and purple, along with blue jeans. Its arms are bent with clenched fists, suggesting motion. To the right of the figure, the front passenger side of a dark-colored car is partially visible.",
    "Motion": "A mannequin-like figure, held in a static running pose with bent arms and clenched fists, moves forward through a dimly lit area, passing a dark car on the right.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at night on a paved surface, possibly a road or parking lot, marked with a yellow line. On the right, the front of a dark car is visible. To the left, there are green trash bins and a yellow bollard. The environment is cast in a cool, bluish light, and the background is blurred, indicating motion. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, reading \"[10].\"",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a mannequin-like figure is positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. To the right, the front of a car occupies the middle ground. In the middle ground to the left, green trash bins are visible, with a yellow bollard positioned in front of them at the bottom left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
