  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot where a person with brown hair, wearing a green pointed hat and a top with medium-length sleeves, sits in a dark gray canoe positioned in the lower center of the frame and in the middle ground. A light-colored pet lies on their back. The canoe floats on a body of opaque, deep red water that fills the lower half of the frame, with small white petals scattered across its surface and drifting down from above. In the foreground, dark, silhouetted bushes are located at the bottom. The background is composed of large, cloud-like masses of white foliage that stretch across the center, set against a dark, purplish-red land or rock formation, with the trunks of a few bare trees visible behind them. A large, dark, curved shape arcs across the top of the frame, separating the landscape from a pale, bright sky. From a level angle above the water, the camera smoothly tracks to the right, following the person in the canoe from the side as they paddle across the still, red body of water.",

    "Subject": "A person with brown hair, wearing a green pointed hat and a top with medium-length sleeves, sits in a dark gray canoe. A light-colored pet lies on their back. The canoe is floating on a body of water that is an opaque, deep red color, with small white petals scattered across its surface. The landscape features bushes and trees with stark white and burgundy leaves and foliage, contrasting with the red water.",
    "Motion": "A person paddles a canoe with a pet on a still, red body of water as small white petals drift down from above, landing on the surface.",
    "Scene": "In a stylized, animated landscape, a small, gray canoe slowly moves across a body of opaque, red water. White petals are scattered across the water's surface and fall gently from above. Dark, silhouetted bushes rest on the water in the foreground. The background features large, cloud-like masses of white foliage against a dark, purplish-red land or rock formation, with the trunks of a few bare trees visible behind them. A large, dark, curved shape arcs across the upper portion of the scene, separating the landscape from a pale, bright sky.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot where a person in a canoe is positioned in the lower center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the foreground, dark bushes are located at the bottom. The canoe floats on a body of red water that fills the lower half of the frame. The background is composed of large, white foliage masses that stretch across the center, set against a dark rock or land formation.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
