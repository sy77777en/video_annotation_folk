  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young man with curly, dark brown hair, wearing a dark blue and red jacket with a dark blue hood and a white textured interior, viewed from behind, occupying the center and right foreground. The scene is set in a brightly lit kitchen during the day, with white tiled walls and metal shelves stocked with clear and white plastic containers of ingredients. A silver stand mixer rests on a counter, and a magnetic strip on the wall holds several pairs of scissors. A window is visible in the background. A second man, partially visible in the middle ground to the left, has short, light brown hair, a light brown beard, and is wearing a blue t-shirt underneath a beige apron. As the person in the jacket moves slightly to their left and right, seemingly unpacking something, the camera, positioned at eye level, uses a shallow depth of field to keep him initially in focus. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward and slightly to the right while panning left, smoothly transitioning focus to a medium close-up of the second man, who becomes centered in the middle ground. The man in the apron, initially facing the kitchen, turns to face the person in the jacket as he begins to speak, smiling warmly. The first person is now a blurred element in the left foreground, while the background kitchen, with shelves and utensils, is clearly visible behind the second person. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene, capturing the interaction between the two men as the focus shifts from the person in the foreground to the individual in the middle ground.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the person in the foreground initially in focus. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward and slightly to the right while panning left, eventually positioning itself to the right of the subject's shoulder. As this movement occurs, the focus shifts from the person in the foreground to the individual in the middle ground.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a view from behind a young man with curly, dark brown hair, who is wearing a dark blue and red jacket with a dark blue hood and a white textured interior. As the scene shifts, a second man is revealed more clearly. This man has short, light brown hair, a light brown beard, and is wearing a blue t-shirt underneath a beige apron. He is looking toward the first man and smiling.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view from behind a person in a jacket, who moves slightly to their left and right, seemingly unpacking something to show to another individual. As they move, the camera shifts, bringing a man in a blue shirt and a beige apron into clearer view. Initially facing the kitchen, the man in the apron turns to face the person in the jacket as he begins to speak, smiling warmly.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a brightly lit kitchen during the day, with white tiled walls and metal shelves stocked with clear and white plastic containers of ingredients. A silver stand mixer rests on a counter, and a magnetic strip on the wall holds several pairs of scissors. A window is visible in the background. Two men are present in the space; one, seen from behind in a dark jacket, interacts with another man who is wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person in a jacket, viewed from behind, occupying the center and right foreground. A second person in an apron is partially visible in the middle ground to the left, with kitchen shelves in the top left background. As the foreground person moves, the camera adjusts its position to the right shoulder of this individual, smoothly transitioning focus to a medium close-up of the second person, who becomes centered in the middle ground. The first person is now a blurred element in the left foreground, while the background kitchen, with shelves and utensils, is clearly visible behind the second person. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
