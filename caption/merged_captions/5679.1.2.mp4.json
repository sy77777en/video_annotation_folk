  "merged_caption": "In a full shot filmed from a low angle, a man with dark skin, a beard, and long dark hair or dreadlocks partially covered by a dark cap sits in the center of the frame on a dark railing that runs horizontally across the middle ground. He is wearing an unbuttoned, red and white plaid long-sleeved shirt over a white t-shirt with a green and yellow graphic, along with loose-fitting, light brown pants. The man holds a yellow phone to his left ear with his left hand, and his head and mouth move slightly as he speaks, but he otherwise remains stationary in a seated position. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in focus while smoothly zooming out. In front of him, another railing runs diagonally from the bottom left to the top right. He is framed by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground at the bottom left, top left, and right side of the frame. In the background, another person is visible inside the house on the top right, walking toward the top left before raising an arm. The scene is viewed from an exterior perspective at night, looking up towards the illuminated upper level of a modern house. Large windows reveal an interior with warm, wood-paneled walls. The space is lit by a spherical white lamp located in the top left and a metallic, dome-shaped pendant light in the top right, both in the background. A silver, dome-shaped structure is located in the house behind the man on the right side of the frame. The camera, initially positioned below the main subject, zooms out during the shot, capturing the architectural setting partially obscured by the out-of-focus green foliage.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion video is captured from a low angle, looking up at a man on a balcony. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in focus while smoothly zooming out.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a man with dark skin, a beard, and long dark hair or dreadlocks partially covered by a dark cap. He is sitting on a dark railing, holding a yellow phone to his left ear with his left hand. He is wearing an unbuttoned, red and white plaid long-sleeved shirt over a white t-shirt that has a green and yellow graphic on it, along with loose-fitting, light brown pants. In the foreground, there are various plants with green leaves. A white, spherical lamp is visible to the left, and a silver, dome-shaped structure is located in the house behind the man on the right side of the frame.",
    "Motion": "A man sits on a railing while holding a phone to his ear and talking. His head and mouth move slightly as he speaks, but he otherwise remains stationary in a seated position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is viewed from an exterior perspective at night, looking up towards the illuminated upper level of a modern house. Large windows reveal an interior with warm, wood-paneled walls. A person in a red plaid shirt sits on a black metal beam that serves as a railing for the indoor balcony, holding a yellow phone to their ear. Another individual is visible walking around inside the room. The space is lit by a spherical white lamp and a metallic, dome-shaped pendant light. The view is partially obscured by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground and to the sides, framing the architectural setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
