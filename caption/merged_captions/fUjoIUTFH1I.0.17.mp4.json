  "merged_caption": "This fixed wide shot captures a street scene from an eye-level perspective across the road. A pale yellow, two-story building occupies the background, spanning the full width of the frame. The building features arched doorways and windows, several of which are flanked by open, light-green wooden shutters. A black iron railing is visible on the second-story balcony. In the middle ground at the bottom, the asphalt road spans the full width of the frame. In the foreground, the front of a dark car is visible in the bottom left, while the rear of a white car is in the bottom right, framing the view. A vintage-style black lamppost stands in the middle ground on the right near an arched entryway. The primary movement within the scene is a person in dark clothing walking a black dog from right to left along the sidewalk in front of the building. This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from an eye-level, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The scene is viewed from across a paved street, with portions of parked cars visible in the foreground on both the right and left sides. The person and the black dog are transient elements that add a sense of life to the environment rather than being the central focus. The architectural charm and atmosphere of the location, characteristic of New Orleans' French Quarter, are the main focus.",

    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a quiet street in a historic district, characterized by its distinctive architecture. A two-story building with a pale yellow facade, arched doorways, and windows framed by light green wooden shutters occupies the center of the frame, with a black wrought-iron balcony running along the upper level. A classic black lamppost stands on the sidewalk next to an arched entryway. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on capturing the architectural charm and atmosphere of the location.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
