  "merged_caption": "The clip is shot from a first-person POV, beginning with a bird’s-eye view of a person’s bare feet positioned in the bottom center foreground, with a dark, textured carpet filling the rest of the frame. The camera starts at hip level, looking down at the floor. As the person stands up, the camera moves upward and tilts upward, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle shot. The view then changes as the camera pans to the right and back with a slightly changing Dutch angle, revealing a wooden chest of drawers in the center middle ground, with rolled white towels on its top surface and a framed picture hanging on the wall above it. To the right of the chest, white built-in closet doors with round wooden knobs are visible in the right middle ground, and a white wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion is positioned in the right foreground. An open doorway is situated in the left middle ground, offering a view into an adjacent room, possibly a bathroom, with a visible sink. To the left of the open doorway, another wooden chest of drawers with a framed painting on top becomes visible as the camera tilts upward. The room's slanted ceiling, featuring a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, occupies the top center middle ground of the frame. The overall lighting is somewhat subdued, and the camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The focus is deep, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The room has white walls and the same brown carpet seen initially.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at hip level with a bird's-eye view looking down at the floor. As the person stands up, the first-person camera tilts upward, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle shot. After this transition, the camera pans right and back with a slightly changing Dutch angle. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The focus is deep, keeping a large depth of field sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a first-person perspective looking down at a pair of bare feet standing on a brown carpeted floor; the lower legs are clad in blue jeans. The camera then pans up and around, revealing a room, possibly an attic bedroom. Visible furnishings include a wooden chest of drawers with rolled white towels placed on top and a framed picture hanging above it, white built-in closet doors with round wooden knobs, and a white wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion. The room has white walls, a slanted ceiling with a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, and the same brown carpet seen initially. A doorway offers a view into an adjacent room, possibly a bathroom.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a person's bare feet on a brown carpeted floor, with the person wearing blue jeans. From a first-person perspective, the camera moves upward as the person stands up, then tilting upward. As the camera pans to the right and back with a slight Dutch angle, a wooden chest of drawers with rolled white towels on top and a framed picture hanging above it comes into view. The camera further reveals a white built-in closet with round wooden knobs and a white wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion. The room has white walls, a slanted ceiling with a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, and the same brown carpet seen initially. A doorway leading to another room, possibly a bathroom, is also visible.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins looking down at bare feet standing on a dark, textured carpet. The view then tilts upwards, revealing an indoor room with a sloped ceiling, a wooden beam, and a skylight. The room contains a wooden chest of drawers with rolled white towels on top, and a colorful abstract painting hanging on the wall above it. To the right of the chest are white, built-in wardrobe doors with round wooden knobs. A light-colored wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion is positioned in front of the wardrobe. An open doorway to the left offers a glimpse into an adjoining bathroom with a visible sink. To the left of the open doorway, another wooden chest of drawers with a framed painting on top becomes visible as the camera tilts upward. The overall lighting is somewhat subdued.",
    "Spatial": "The clip is shot from a first-person POV. It begins with a bird’s-eye view of a person’s bare feet positioned in the bottom center foreground, with a dark, textured carpet filling the rest of the frame. The camera initially moves upward and then tilts upward, reaching a level angle before panning to the right and back with a slightly changing Dutch angle. As the view changes, a wooden chest of drawers enters the frame in the center middle ground, with rolled white towels on its top surface and a framed picture hanging on the wall above it. To the right of the chest, white built-in closet doors are visible in the right middle ground, and a white wooden chair with a patterned cushion is positioned in the right foreground. An open doorway is situated in the left middle ground, offering a view into an adjacent room. The room's slanted ceiling, featuring a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, occupies the top center middle ground of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
