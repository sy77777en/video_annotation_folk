  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of the surroundings, tracking a person with short, dark hair from behind and focusing on their upper body. This provides more context for the architectural structure. The person, silhouetted against the light, walks forward at a steady pace towards a large, ancient stone structure with a dome-like top, flanked by reddish-brown walls on the left and right. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast between the dark figure and the illuminated background. As the person moves forward, the camera, positioned near their upper torso, smoothly follows them, maintaining a consistent distance. In the middle ground, a large, textured, conical stone structure is centered. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning from a level angle to a low angle, causing the stone structure to fill more of the frame and revealing its full dome shape. The top of the archway moves out of the frame, exposing the bright sky at the top in the background. The person remains in the center foreground relative to the frame throughout the camera's upward tilt. The setting appears to be during the day, with bright light illuminating the top of the dome, highlighting its rough texture and subtle color variations. The overall atmosphere is minimalistic, with the focus on the geometric shapes and contrasting colors of the stone and walls. The video showcases the interaction between the person and the structure, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the architecture, while the focus remains deep, maintaining clarity across the scene. The structure is prominently made of textured stone with a dome-like shape, flanked by reddish-brown walls, creating a stark contrast against the stone.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned near the upper torso of a person from behind. It smoothly moves forward, following the person, and finishes with a subtle upward tilt, transitioning from a level angle to a low angle. The focus remains deep, maintaining clarity across the scene.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a person with short, dark hair, seen from behind, walking toward a large, ancient architectural structure. Due to the lighting, the person's features and clothing are not clearly visible, but they appear to be wearing a dark jacket. The structure, prominently made of textured stone with a dome-like shape, is flanked by reddish-brown walls. The video begins with a wide shot, capturing the person as they approach the structure, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the architecture. The focus remains on the interaction between the person and the structure, highlighting the contrast between the human figure and the imposing, historical edifice.",
    "Motion": "A person with short, dark hair, silhouetted against the light, walks forward towards a large, ancient stone structure with a dome-like top. The structure is flanked by reddish-brown walls, and the lighting creates a dramatic contrast between the dark figure and the illuminated background. The person continues to move closer to the structure, maintaining a steady pace, while the camera keeps a consistent distance, emphasizing the grandeur and historical significance of the architecture.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character from shoulder height, set in an outdoor environment. Initially, the character is in a dark space and then walks out towards a large, dome-shaped structure made of dark, textured stone, positioned centrally. The character exits through an opening with two vertical sides and a top that converges to form a point, resembling a pentagon shape. The structure is flanked by two angular walls with a reddish hue, creating a stark contrast against the stone. The setting appears to be during the day, with bright light illuminating the top of the dome, highlighting its rough texture and subtle color variations. The overall atmosphere is minimalistic, with the focus on the geometric shapes and contrasting colors of the stone and walls.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
