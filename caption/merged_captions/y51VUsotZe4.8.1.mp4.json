  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide, top-down scenery shot capturing a city grid at night from an extreme high angle. The camera is positioned directly overhead, looking straight down, employing deep focus with a large depth of field to ensure all elements remain sharp. A main road runs vertically through the center-right of the frame, with intersecting streets creating a grid pattern across the background. In the foreground, a large, dark building occupies the bottom-left portion of the frame, while another building with a circular pattern on its roof is visible in the bottom-right middle ground. The middle ground is defined by the shorter buildings and city blocks. The background features the illuminated streets and the flow of vehicle lights extending into the distance at the top of the frame. The video begins with this aerial view of a city at night, showing a grid of streets illuminated by streetlights and building lights. As the camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, more of the cityscape becomes visible, including various buildings with lit windows and a few moving vehicles on the streets. The forward movement of the camera provides a broader view of the city, showcasing the interconnectedness of the streets and the distribution of lights across the urban landscape. The setting is outdoors, featuring a grid of city streets illuminated by streetlights and the glow of vehicle headlights. Tall buildings with varying architectural designs line the streets, their windows emitting a warm, ambient light. The roads are busy with moving traffic, creating a dynamic pattern of light trails. The overall atmosphere is vibrant, with the cityscape's lights contrasting against the dark night sky, highlighting the structured layout and lively activity of the urban setting.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the ground. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an aerial view of an urban environment at night, focusing on the intricate network of streets and the illuminated patterns created by streetlights and buildings. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object. The grid-like arrangement of roads, the glowing windows, and the movement of vehicles contribute to a dynamic and expansive portrayal of the city, highlighting its vibrant and bustling nature.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a city at night, showing a grid of streets illuminated by streetlights and building lights. As the camera moves forward, more of the cityscape becomes visible, including various buildings with lit windows and a few moving vehicles on the streets. The camera continues to advance, revealing more of the city's layout, including intersections and additional buildings. The forward movement of the camera provides a broader view of the city, showcasing the interconnectedness of the streets and the distribution of lights across the urban landscape.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an aerial view of a bustling urban environment at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a grid of city streets illuminated by streetlights and the glow of vehicle headlights. Tall buildings with varying architectural designs line the streets, their windows emitting a warm, ambient light. The roads are busy with moving traffic, creating a dynamic pattern of light trails. The scene is characterized by a mix of straight and intersecting roads, with visible intersections and crosswalks. The overall atmosphere is vibrant, with the cityscape's lights contrasting against the dark night sky, highlighting the structured layout and lively activity of the urban setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
