  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a computer monitor displaying a social media post from a user named AndresFreundTec, dated March 29, discussing the accidental discovery of a security issue and recommending an immediate upgrade for users of \"bleeding edge\" software distributions. Below the text, a link preview for openwall.com shows a title that reads \"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\". The screen's interface is dark and monochromatic with light-colored text, serving as one of the main light sources in the unlit space. Another screen with a light interface is partially visible on the left. This eye-level, level-angle shot begins with the computer screen in deep focus. The camera, exhibiting smooth but minor wobbling, then pulls back quickly, revealing the silhouette of a person sitting in front of the monitors, positioned in the center-left middle ground. As the camera moves backward, the focus shifts, blurring the screen and the person visible through what appears to be the vertical gap between two glass panels or blinds, while the blinds themselves remain relatively sharp. The view is framed by blurred areas on both sides and is partially obscured by the vertical gap. In the final composition, the person and their monitors are visible in the background through the narrow gap in the middle ground, while the foreground on the left and right sides features vertical blurred portions. Overlay text in the bottom left corner of the video reads \"@AndresFreundTec / x.com.\" A blurry object is also present in the foreground, contributing to the scene's obscured and dimly lit atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "The video opens on a computer screen displaying a social media post in dark mode. The post, from a user named AndresFreundTec and dated March 29, discusses the accidental discovery of a security issue and includes a link to an openwall.com article titled \"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\". As the view pulls back, a person is revealed sitting in a dimly lit room, seen mostly in silhouette in front of two monitors, one of which is the screen from the opening. The scene is then progressively obscured by the vertical gap between glass window panes or glass door panels. Through the glass between the blurred frames on both sides of the gap, the person and the screens are faintly visible.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a full view of a computer screen, with a second screen partially visible on the left. As the camera pulls back, it reveals a person's silhouette sitting in front of two monitors. The camera continues to move backward, showing that the scene is framed and obscured by several horizontal gaps.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
