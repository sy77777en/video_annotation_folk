  "merged_caption": "The scene opens with a close-up shot centered on the heads of a man and a woman lying on the floor. The man, initially positioned on the left, has fair skin, short dark hair, and is wearing a dark sweater. The woman, on the right, also has fair skin and long dark hair, and she is dressed in a dark, long-sleeved top with cutouts at the shoulders. The camera smoothly rolls clockwise while simultaneously moving upward, maintaining a consistent bird's-eye view. As the camera transitions to a full overhead shot, it reveals their full bodies spread out in opposite directions on a floor covered with scattered black and white photographs. The couple subtly moves their mouths as if talking, occasionally blinks, and the man gently moves his right arm to hold the woman's left arm, but there are no significant movements. In the final composition, the full bodies of the man and woman are visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. They lie on their backs with their heads together, their bodies extending in opposite directions. They are surrounded by a circle of scattered black and white photographs on the floor, positioned in the background. A long, rectangular lamp on a stand becomes visible in the foreground, positioned above their bodies. The environment is bathed in a cool, blue-toned light emanating from the lamp. The camera remains directly above the subjects throughout the transition, maintaining a deep focus, keeping both the couple and the scattered photographs around them sharp.",

    "Camera": "This is a bird's-eye view shot looking directly down at a man and a woman lying on the floor. The camera smoothly rolls clockwise while simultaneously moving upward, transitioning to a full overhead shot. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the couple and the scattered photographs around them sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man and a woman are lying on their backs on the floor with their heads close together, their legs stretched out in opposite directions. The man, initially positioned on the left, has fair skin, short dark hair, and is wearing a dark sweater. The woman, on the right, also has fair skin and long dark hair, and she is dressed in a dark, long-sleeved top with cutouts at the shoulders. The view begins as a close-up on their faces and then moves upward and rotates, revealing their full bodies spread out.",
    "Motion": "The shot begins with a close-up on the faces of a man and a woman lying still on the floor. The camera then moves upward and rotates, maintaining a bird's-eye view, revealing their full bodies spread out in opposite directions on a floor covered with scattered photographs. Throughout the shot, the couple subtly moves their mouths as if talking, occasionally blinks, and the man gently moves his right arm to hold the woman's left arm, but there are no significant movements.",
    "Scene": "From a bird's eye view, an indoor scene unfolds on a plain floor. A man and a woman lie on their backs, their heads close together, surrounded by a wide circle of scattered black and white photographs. The environment is bathed in a cool, blue-toned light emanating from a single source—a long, rectangular lamp on a stand that becomes visible as the camera slowly pulls away. The photographs, varying in size, are strewn across the floor, creating a cluttered surface. The camera's gradual upward movement reveals the full extent of the scene, showing the subjects' entire bodies arranged in opposite directions amidst the sea of images.",
    "Spatial": "The scene opens with a close-up shot centered on the heads of a man and a woman lying on the floor.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
