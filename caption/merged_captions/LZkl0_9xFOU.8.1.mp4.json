  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the main subject, a humanoid figure with a featureless white face and short, dark gray, side-swept hair, wearing a vibrant tie-dye t-shirt with swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink, seated at the center of the frame. This figure faces a black computer monitor located on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at hip level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the midground. It slightly moves forward and downward toward the humanoid figure, incorporating a slight upward tilt to adjust its framing, with some unsteady shaking. To the left in the middle ground, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background on the center right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure wearing a dark blue top is present. A blurred element, possibly a computer tower, occupies the bottom foreground, adding depth to the scene. The environment suggests an indoor office or workspace with dim, cool-toned artificial lighting. A potted plant and a shelf are discernible in the background. An overlay of white text reading \"Nathan Leroux\" is initially present on the bottom right corner and gradually disappears in a dynamic and visually appealing manner as the video progresses. All figures remain stationary throughout the video.",

This movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video centers on a humanoid figure with a featureless white face, lacking eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and short, dark gray, side-swept hair. This figure is seated and appears to be interacting with a black computer monitor. The main subject is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt with a vibrant tie-dye pattern displaying swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink. In the middle ground to the left, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background to the right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure is also present.

    "Motion": "The video features a humanoid figure with a featureless white face and short, dark gray, side-swept hair, seated and operating a black computer monitor. The figure is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt with a vibrant tie-dye pattern displaying swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink. In the middle ground to the left, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background to the right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure is also present. In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, there is a blurred outline resembling a device, possibly a computer tower, adding depth to the scene. White text overlay reading 'Nathan Leroux' is visible in the bottom right corner and gradually disappears in a dynamic and cool manner as the video progresses. All figures remain stationary throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor scene, likely an office or workspace, characterized by dim, cool-toned artificial lighting. A faceless mannequin-like figure with short, dark hair featuring a lighter streak, wearing a tie-dye t-shirt with swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink, is seated at a desk. This figure faces a black computer monitor that is prominent on the right side of the view. In the middle ground, a figure in light-colored pants and a light top stands to the left, and a figure wearing a dark blue top is visible further back on the right. A potted plant and a shelf are also discernible in the background. An overlay text \"Nathan LerouX\" in white is present in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
