  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a white woman with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, centered in the frame and the foreground. She is figure skating in an ice skating arena, wearing a long-sleeved, turquoise leotard decorated with sequins and featuring a sheer, nude-colored panel on the chest. The scene is set against a dark, out-of-focus crowd under bright stadium lights. Initially, the camera captures her from a low-angle, eye-level view as she faces the camera with a focused expression, extending both arms. The camera then smoothly cranes upward in an arc, transitioning to a high-angle, top-down perspective. During this motion, she raises one arm while lowering the other, alternating them in circular motions. This reveals a full shot of the woman, who remains centered in the frame, now surrounded by the expansive white surface of the ice rink, which fills the background. The entire sequence is presented in a widescreen format, framed by black bars at the top and bottom, with a shallow depth of field keeping the skater in focus throughout the movement.",

    "Camera": "This shot begins at a low-angle, eye-level on the female ice skater. The camera then smoothly cranes up in an arc, transitioning to an overhead, high-angle perspective. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the skater in the foreground in focus throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "A white woman with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail is shown figure skating. She is wearing a long-sleeved, turquoise leotard decorated with sequins and featuring a sheer, nude-colored panel on the chest. While on the ice, she faces the camera with a focused expression, extending both arms. At one point, she raises one arm while lowering the other, alternating them in circular motions.",
    "Motion": "A female figure skater, initially keeps still and facing the camera, extends both arms all the time; at one point, she raises one arm while the other is lowered, alternating in a fluid motion. The camera angle then changes to an overhead shot.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside an ice skating arena, with a dark, out-of-focus crowd in the background under bright stadium lights. The perspective initially captures a figure skater on the ice from a low-angle, eye-level view before shifting to a high-angle, top-down view that shows the expansive white surface of the rink. The entire sequence is presented in a widescreen format, framed by black bars at the top and bottom.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
