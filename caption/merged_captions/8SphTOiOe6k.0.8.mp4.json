  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a sunlit street scene, capturing both people and vehicles within a small town setting. Initially, a white car is positioned in the center, driving from the background towards the foreground, centrally aligned in the frame. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward along the road, initially panning right to face the street. The handheld camera exhibits slight unsteadiness with some shaking. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right, with two women carrying bags and a man walking alongside a woman in a yellow top over a white shirt and blue jeans. These pedestrians are in the middle ground, moving towards the foreground. A cyclist is seen on the left, riding towards the foreground, initially in the middle ground. The street is lined with traditional wooden buildings on both sides, with trees displaying autumn foliage, positioned in the background. The time of day is afternoon, as indicated by the clear blue sky and the long shadows cast on the ground. The street is paved and features a narrow sidewalk bordered by low stone walls and lush greenery. In the distance, a mountain range is visible, providing a scenic backdrop. As the video progresses, the car exits the frame from the left side, while some pedestrians walk towards the camera and others walk away, maintaining a calm and steady pace. The overall atmosphere is serene and inviting, with a blend of natural and architectural elements, typical of a small town or suburban area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
