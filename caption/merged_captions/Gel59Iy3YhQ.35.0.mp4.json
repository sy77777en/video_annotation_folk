  "merged_caption": "A high-angle wide shot frames an elevated, ruined courtyard in a third-person 3D game video. Initially, a small, fox-like character with orange fur, a bushy tail, and wearing a green tunic stands in the center-bottom-left of the frame. In the center, a large, angular, stone-like enemy with a brown-green color and three illuminated eyes in blue, pink, and green is assembled from a pile of rocks. The camera captures the scene from an aerial level perspective with a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground action in focus. As the enemy, named \"Garden Knight,\" attacks with a large sword that generates sweeping orange laser beams and a trail of flames, the camera tracks the player character while arcing around the central boss, first moving counterclockwise, then clockwise, and finally counterclockwise again. The shot is slightly unsteady, with noticeable shaking accompanying the boss's impacts on the ground. The fox character skillfully dodges the attacks by swiftly moving from the center-bottom-left to the center-right of the frame, before closing in on the enemy in the center to strike back, causing bright white flashes on impact. The camera maintains its overhead perspective throughout the sequence. The arena features a floor of green grass, small white flowers, and blue-tiled pathways, with ruined pillars in the surroundings. A tiered stone platform sits in the center, and a small hexagonal pool of water is located on the left. Overlays on the screen include a heads-up display with three vertical bars in pink, red, and blue at the bottom left, item icons in the top right, and the enemy's name, \"Garden Knight,\" in the bottom right. The scene is framed with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.",

    "Subject": "The video features two main subjects. The first is a large figure with a brown-green color and a non-humanoid appearance. It has an imposing presence and is constructed from angular shapes, featuring three illuminated objects resembling eyes in blue, pink, and green. The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic. This creature is positioned near the larger figure, highlighting a stark contrast in size and form. Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their atypical and striking appearances.",
    "Motion": "The video depicts a large, angular figure with a brown-green color and three illuminated eyes in blue, pink, and green, persistently attempting to hit a smaller, fox-like figure with a large sword with an orange electric glow effect., creating a trail of flames. The smaller creature, with orange fur, a bushy tail, and wearing a green tunic, skillfully dodges the attacks by swiftly moving to the side.  The smaller figure ultimately counters by striking the larger figure with a sword at the end of the video.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a battle unfolds within an elevated, outdoor courtyard made of green stone. The arena features a floor of green grass, small white flowers, and blue-tiled pathways, with ruined pillars in the surroundings. A tiered stone platform sits in the center, and a small hexagonal pool of water is located on the left. A small, orange, fox-like character faces a large, blocky, stone-like enemy that assembles itself from a pile of rocks. The enemy attacks with a sword, which generates sweeping orange laser beams when swung, while the fox character dodges and strikes back, causing bright white flashes on impact. Overlays on the screen include a heads-up display with three vertical bars in pink, red, and blue at the bottom left, item icons in the top right, and the enemy's name, \"Garden Knight,\" in the bottom right. The scene is framed with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.",
    "Spatial": "A high-angle wide shot frames an elevated, ruined courtyard. Initially, a small, fox-like character stands in the center-bottom-left of the frame. In the center of the frame, a large, stone-like enemy is assembled from a pile of rocks. As the enemy attacks, it remains in the center due to the camera movement, creating orange energy beams while swinging its sword. The fox character moves from the center-bottom-left to the center-right of the frame to dodge the attack before closing in on the enemy in the center to strike back. The camera maintains its overhead perspective throughout the sequence. Game interface elements are overlaid in the corners of the screen."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
