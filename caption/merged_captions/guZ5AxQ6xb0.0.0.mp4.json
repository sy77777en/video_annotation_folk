  "merged_caption": "A full shot, filmed at the subject's level, shows a helicopter stationary in the center of the frame. The helicopter, with a dark-colored fuselage and hints of yellow and red markings, is situated in the middle ground, resting on skids that are partially buried in a deep layer of white snow. Its three long, black main rotor blades are extended horizontally, and a smaller tail rotor is visible in the background. The helicopter is shown from a frontal perspective, its form blurred and partially obscured by falling snow. The scene is a vast, snow-covered expanse during a heavy snowfall, with the entire scene out of focus, rendering the helicopter as a soft silhouette against the white, indistinct background. Snowflakes fall continuously, further obscuring the view of the aircraft and its motionless rotor blades. The camera remains static, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the falling snow in the foreground, creating a blurred effect on the helicopter in the snowy landscape. The helicopter remains stationary on the snow-covered ground as snow falls in front of it and the camera. Falling snow is visible throughout the frame, from the foreground to the background, creating a layered effect. The background is an indistinct white expanse. While the helicopter and background are out of focus, the falling snow in the foreground is relatively clear and visible.",

The helicopter is situated in the middle ground, resting on a snow-covered surface that extends into the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
