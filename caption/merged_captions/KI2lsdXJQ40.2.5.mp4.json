  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing a man in a black suit and a woman in a blue dress positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center-left sides of the frame, both at the center height of the camera. The man stands slightly left of center, while the woman is to his right. Behind them, in the background and right-center of the frame, three characters are grouped: a woman with gray hair and a black hat stands to the left, a man with short dark hair is on the right, and a tall, bald man in a grey suit stands with his back to the camera in the center. A girl with short brown hair is also visible in the middle ground, positioned on the right side. The background features a bench along the left wall and a large window or glass door on the right. The focus starts on the figures in the foreground, with the man picking up food from his plate and eating it, while the woman slightly moves her head as if in conversation. The camera, captured from a smooth, eye-level, level-angle, employs a shallow depth of field and performs a rack focus, shifting the focus plane to the girl in the middle ground, who wipes her face with a handkerchief. The camera then attempts to focus on the figures in the background, where the woman with gray hair and the man beside her face the tall, bald man. The scene behind the door remains slightly blurred, adding an interesting layer to the composition. Concurrently, the camera trucks to the right, gradually slowing to a stop, centering on the three background characters, now in sharper focus, while the initial foreground subjects become blurred, and the woman in the foreground moves out of the primary frame. The spacious room has light blue walls, brown tiled floors, and soft, even lighting, creating a calm atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a smooth, eye-level, level-angle camera. The shot employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man and woman in the foreground. The camera then performs a rack focus, shifting the focus plane to the people in the midground, and attempts to focus on the figures in the background. The scene behind the door in the background remains slightly blurred, adding an interesting layer to the composition. Concurrently, the camera trucks to the right, gradually slowing to a stop.",
    "Subject": "The video shows several claymation humanoid characters dressed in formal black attire, suggesting a social or formal gathering. In the foreground, a man with light skin, short brown hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a black suit and white shirt, holding a small plate of food and facing slightly to the left. To his right stands a woman with light skin, short dark hair, glasses, and a blue dress with a dark top, holding a cake and facing him as if in conversation. In the background center, three more characters are most prominent: a woman with gray hair and a black hat stands next to a man with short dark hair, both wearing black outfits and facing a tall, bald man in a grey suit who stands with his back to the camera. Additionally, there is a girl with short brown hair wearing a dark dress in the middle ground. All characters have stylized, elongated heads and neutral or subdued facial expressions, and their poses suggest they are engaged in quiet social interaction.",
    "Motion": "The man in the foreground picks up some food from the plate he is holding and eats it, facing slightly to the left. The woman next to him slightly moves her head while holding a cake and facing him as if engaged in conversation. In the background, the woman with gray hair and the man beside her stand side by side, both facing a tall, bald man in a grey suit who stands with his back to the camera. The girl in the middle ground stands and wipes her face with a handkerchief in her right hand, seemingly wiping away tears.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a spacious room with light blue walls and a large window or glass door letting in natural daylight. The floor is covered with brown tiles that have a subtle, textured pattern. Several figures, crafted in a stylized manner with elongated heads and simplified facial features, are dressed in dark formal attire and are positioned throughout the room, some standing in small groups. The lighting is soft and even, creating a calm atmosphere. The background includes a bench along one wall and a door with glass panes. No overlays or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing a man in a black suit and a woman in a blue dress positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center-left sides of the frame, both at the center height of the camera. The man stands slightly left of center, while the woman is to his right.

A girl with short brown hair is also visible in the middle ground, positioned on the right side. The background features a bench along the left wall and a large window or glass door on the right. The focus starts on the figures in the foreground, then shifts through a rack focus to the figure in the middle ground, and finally to the figures in the background, although the scene behind the door remains slightly blurred. As the focus shifts, the camera transitions to center on the three background characters, now in sharper focus, while the initial foreground subjects become blurred, and the woman in the foreground moves out of the primary frame. Throughout, the camera remains at the subjects’ eye level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the characters."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
