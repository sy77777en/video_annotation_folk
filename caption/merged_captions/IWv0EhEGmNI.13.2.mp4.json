  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a person wearing beige tactical gloves holds a black shotgun equipped with a tactical sight in the foreground, occupying the bottom and right portions of the frame. The scene is set in a dimly lit, narrow indoor hallway with patterned wallpaper above dark wood wainscoting, marked by red blood splatters on the left wall. Initially, the camera pans right, focusing on a dark wooden door in the center middle ground, marked with a red circular \"no entry\" sign featuring a white rim, illuminated by an overhead light positioned at the top center. The perspective moves quickly forward down the hallway, simulating the viewpoint of a character moving through the space while holding a gun. The camera then pans left, revealing a darker corridor that now occupies the center of the frame, where a figure dressed in full military gear, including a helmet and tactical vest, becomes visible in the background at the end of this new corridor. The shotgun remains in the foreground, now aimed down the corridor, while a white radiator appears in the foreground on the left. Overlays are present, including a heads-up display in the bottom right corner showing ammunition counts and weapon icons. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"Price: Get that door open, Sergeant!\" Bloody marks appear as overlays on the camera, fading over the course of the video, leaving only a constant red streak. This red streak moves throughout the video, initially moving counterclockwise as the camera pans right and then clockwise as the camera pans left, as if following a circular track. A white crosshair is centered on the screen. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp.",

    "Camera": "This is a first-person perspective from a shooting game, filmed at a slightly unsteady eye-level. The camera moves quickly forward down a hallway, panning right and then left to scan the area for enemies. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person wearing beige tactical gloves holds a black shotgun equipped with a tactical sight. The scene is set in a dimly lit, narrow hallway with patterned wallpaper marked by red blood splatters. Directly in front is a dark wooden door with a red circular \"no entry\" sign featuring a white rim. Further down the dark corridor, another figure dressed in full military gear, including a helmet and tactical vest, can be seen standing.",
    "Motion": "The video, shot from a first-person perspective, simulates the viewpoint of a character moving through an interior space while holding a gun. Initially, the camera pans right, focusing on a door marked with a \"No Entry\" sign. It then moves forward before panning left, revealing a figure in military gear standing at the end of the corridor.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place in a dimly lit and narrow indoor hallway. The walls feature patterned wallpaper above dark wood wainscoting. At the end of the corridor, a closed wooden door with a \"no entry\" symbol is illuminated by an overhead light. The perspective, holding a black shotgun, moves forward and then turns to peer down an adjacent, darker hallway where a figure is visible in the distance. A white radiator is positioned against the left wall. Overlays are present, including a heads-up display in the bottom right corner showing ammunition counts and weapon icons. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"Price: Get that door open, Sergeant!\" Bloody marks appear as overlays on the camera, fading over the course of the video, leaving only a constant red streak. This red streak moves throughout the video, initially moving counterclockwise as the camera pans right and then clockwise as the camera pans left, as if following a circular track.

    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a black shotgun is held in the foreground, occupying the bottom and right portions of the frame and aimed at a wooden door in the center middle ground. An overhead light is positioned at the top center, illuminating the door, while blood splatters are visible on the left wall. The perspective moves forward and then pivots to the left, shifting the view to a dark corridor that now occupies the center of the frame. A figure in military gear becomes visible in the background at the end of this new corridor. The shotgun remains in the foreground, now aimed down the corridor, while a white radiator appears in the foreground on the left. A heads-up display is consistently visible in the bottom right corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
