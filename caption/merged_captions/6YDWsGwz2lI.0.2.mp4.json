  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, focusing on a street flanked by tall buildings. The buildings are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, extending vertically into the background, creating a symmetrical composition. The prominent skyscraper is centrally located in the background, serving as the focal point. Streetlights are visible in the middle ground on both sides, adding depth and contrast to the scene. The camera is positioned at street level, capturing the grandeur of the architecture from a low angle perspective, emphasizing the height and scale of the buildings. The framing remains consistent throughout the video, maintaining the viewer's focus on the architectural symmetry and the towering presence of the skyscraper. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a sense of depth and perspective down the street. It is shot at eye level with a low angle, looking up from below, employing deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The video captures an outdoor urban setting, showcasing a street flanked by tall, imposing buildings with a classic architectural style. The scene is set during the day, under a clear sky, allowing natural light to illuminate the area. The buildings are characterized by their vertical lines and numerous windows, with some displaying American flags. Streetlights are visible, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cool tones of the buildings. The street is relatively empty, emphasizing the grandeur and scale of the architecture. The perspective is centered, drawing the viewer's eye towards a prominent skyscraper in the background, which stands as a focal point in the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a view of towering buildings lining a street, with a prominent skyscraper in the background. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighted by the symmetry of the architecture and the warm glow of streetlights. The scene emphasizes the scale and grandeur of the urban landscape rather than a specific object, creating a sense of immersion in the city environment.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a street lined with tall buildings on both sides, with a prominent skyscraper in the background. The buildings are illuminated by street lamps, and American flags are visible on the buildings. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a sense of depth and perspective down the street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
