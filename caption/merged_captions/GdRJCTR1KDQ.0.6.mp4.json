  "merged_caption": "This wide shot begins with a white aerosol can with a white cap and a red band around its top, resting on a grey, rectangular cinder block positioned in the center-left foreground on a patch of dry, brown grass dotted with fallen leaves. A concrete driveway sits in the middle ground, with the front of a silver SUV in the top right background. The camera maintains a fixed, high-angle position above the can throughout the entire shot, filmed from ground level. The video uses a speed ramp effect, alternating between fast and slow motion. The focus is shallow, keeping the can sharp while the background remains blurred. Foam is expelled from two opposite holes in the can, indicating it has been pierced, and this propels the can upwards and towards the left side of the frame while spinning. The can begins to spray a white, foamy substance through the holes, causing it to spin rapidly in place. The force of the spray then launches the can into the air, where it tumbles and spins while continuing to eject the substance in a wide arc across the grass. The can remains within the frame until the end of the video, appearing to be on a trajectory to soon exit the frame as the video concludes. In the background, the front portion of a silver SUV is visible on a concrete driveway.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, high-angle shot filmed from ground level. The video uses a speed ramp effect, alternating between fast and slow motion. The focus is shallow, keeping the can of whipped cream in the foreground sharp while the background remains blurred.",
    "Subject": "A white aerosol can with a white cap and a red band around its top rests on a grey, rectangular cinder block. The can, which has a small, colorful graphic on its label, begins to expel a white, foamy substance simultaneously from two holes on opposite sides, suggesting that something has pierced through it. The force of the expulsion propels the can into the air, causing it to lift off the cinder block and spin while continuing to eject the white substance in a wide arc across the dry, brown grass. In the background, the front portion of a silver SUV is visible on a concrete driveway.",
    "Motion": "A white aerosol can on a cinder block begins to spray a white substance through two small holes that suddenly open in the middle of the can, causing it to spin rapidly in place. The force of the spray then launches the can into the air, where it tumbles and spins while continuing to eject the substance in a wide arc across the grass.",
    "Scene": "In a residential yard during the day, a white aerosol can with a red label is positioned on a gray concrete block. The block sits on a patch of dry, brown grass dotted with fallen leaves. The can begins to emit a white, misty spray from its sides, causing it to spin and then lift into the air, flying erratically. In the background, a concrete driveway and the front of a silver vehicle are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
