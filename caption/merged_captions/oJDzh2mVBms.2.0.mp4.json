  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a snowy landscape during the blue hour of twilight. The composition is divided horizontally, with the expansive sky occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame and the snow-covered ground filling the bottom third. The camera is positioned at eye level and angled upward from a low angle, remaining completely static throughout, using deep focus to keep both the snowy landscape and the sky in sharp detail. The time-lapse effect causes clouds to drift across the sky from right to left, moving rapidly and emphasizing the passage of time as the light changes on the horizon. The sky is a deep, dark blue that fades into lighter shades of blue, pink, and orange along the horizon, where a line of dark, dense forest stands. In the middle ground, on the bottom left of the frame, two light-colored, geometric buildings are visible, nestled in snowdrifts, with light visible through a few small windows on one of them. A dark treeline stretches across the background along the horizon, from the center to the right side of the frame. The foreground and middle ground consist of a wide, flat field of pristine white snow, enhancing the overall composition. The scene begins in the deep blue of twilight, with the sky gradually lightening as warm orange and pink tones appear on the horizon, backlighting the distant, dark line of evergreen trees. Wispy clouds drift across the expansive sky, catching the emerging sunlight. The primary motion is the movement of clouds drifting across the sky as the light changes on the horizon, while the buildings and snow-covered ground remain static throughout the shot. The composition emphasizes the atmospheric transformation and the immense scale of the cold landscape, focusing on the changing light and the serene, stark beauty of the setting.",

    "Camera": "A time-lapse video played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled upward from a low angle. The camera remains completely static throughout, using deep focus to keep both the snowy landscape and the sky in sharp detail. The time-lapse effect causes clouds and changing light in the sky above the snowy building to move rapidly, emphasizing the passage of time.",
    "Subject": "This video is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the progression of dawn over a vast, snow-covered environment. The scene begins in the deep blue of twilight, with the sky gradually lightening as warm orange and pink tones appear on the horizon, backlighting a distant, dark line of evergreen trees. Wispy clouds drift across the expansive sky, catching the emerging sunlight. A wide, flat field of pristine white snow prominently features in both the foreground and middle ground, enhancing the overall composition. Two simple, light-colored, boxy buildings are nestled in snowdrifts on the left. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the atmospheric transformation and the immense scale of the cold landscape, focusing on the changing light and the serene, stark beauty of the setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a snowy, subarctic landscape at twilight. The primary motion is the movement of clouds drifting across the sky as the light changes on the horizon. The buildings and snow-covered ground remain static throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "A timelapse captures a snowy landscape during the blue hour of twilight. The sky is a deep, dark blue that fades into lighter shades of blue, pink, and orange along the horizon, where a line of dark, dense forest stands. Wispy clouds drift across the sky, their colors shifting with the fading light. A vast, flat field completely covered in white snow extends across both the foreground and middle ground of the scene. To the left, two light-colored, geometric buildings are situated in the snow, with light visible through a few small windows on one of them.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a snowy landscape. The composition is divided horizontally, with the expansive sky occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame and the snow-covered ground filling the bottom third. In the middle ground, on the bottom left of the frame, two light-colored buildings are visible. A dark treeline stretches across the background along the horizon, from the center to the right side of the frame. The foreground and middle ground consist of a wide, flat field of snow. The camera is positioned at a low angle, capturing the scene from a fixed perspective. The only spatial change is the time-lapsed movement of clouds, which drift across the sky from right to left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
