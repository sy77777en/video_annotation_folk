  "merged_caption": "This static medium close-up shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, capturing a man positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground, primarily facing forward with a slight turn to the right. The back of a woman's head and her right shoulder occupy the right foreground. The man, with wet, dark hair and a slightly reddish-brown skin tone, wears a beige jacket over a blue shirt. His expression appears focused and intense as he speaks to the woman, who has long brown hair, but her face is not visible. The setting is intimate, with personal items visible around them, indicating a private space. In the background, a mirror with lights is visible on the far left, while pink curtains are situated in the left-center. A decorated wall with various items, including a pink pom-pom, is located in the background on the right. The environment is a softly lit room with pastel-colored walls adorned with various decorations, including plush items and framed pictures. A window with sheer curtains allows diffused light to enter, creating a warm ambiance. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in sharp focus. The character's wet hair suggests recent exposure to rain or water, enhancing the intimate and personal atmosphere of the setting, with the character's expression and posture indicating a moment of interaction or conversation.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
