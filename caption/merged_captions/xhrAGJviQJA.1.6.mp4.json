  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the snowboarder's arms and snowboard intermittently occupy the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground. The scene is framed by two steep, brown, rugged rock walls partially covered in snow that extend from the foreground to the middle ground on the left and right sides, creating a narrow, central channel. The camera, positioned at the snowboarder's eye level, moves smoothly forward, capturing a first-person view of the snowboarder descending the narrow, snow-filled mountain couloir. The snowboarder carves through the powder, making turns from one side of the tight passage to the other, kicking up clouds of snow with each movement. This movement causes the rock walls to rush past on either side, while snow is kicked up from the bottom of the frame, obscuring the immediate foreground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the rocky walls and the snowy path ahead clear. Mild barrel distortion is present, causing a slight outward bowing at the frame's edges. In the background, centered between the walls, a sunlit, snow-covered mountain range is visible. The distant mountain landscape in the center background gradually grows larger as the snowboarder descends. The snowboarder's arms, clad in blue jacket sleeves and black gloves, are occasionally visible, as are their olive-green snow pants. The snowboard underfoot has blue and black graphics. The scene captures a rapid descent down the narrow, steep, snow-filled couloir on a sunny day in a high-altitude mountain range. In the distance, at the end of the chute, a wider, sunlit, snow-covered mountain landscape can be seen under a clear blue sky.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a rapid descent down a narrow, steep, snow-filled couloir on a sunny day in a high-altitude mountain range. Towering, brown, jagged rock walls, partially covered in snow, flank the tight passage. Deep, powdery snow covers the ground, and a spray of white is kicked up by the movement. From this perspective, a pair of gloved hands in blue sleeves and a snowboard are sometimes visible at the bottom of the view. In the distance, at the end of the chute, a wider, sunlit, snow-covered mountain landscape can be seen under a clear blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
