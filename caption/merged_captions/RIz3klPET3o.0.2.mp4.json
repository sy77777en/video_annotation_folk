  "merged_caption": "The video is an extreme wide shot with a side-view camera perspective, maintaining a consistent distance from the action. Initially, a black stick-figure cyclist, rendered with pronounced simplicity and wearing a blue and red scarf, is positioned in the center right of the frame, situated on a small, flat segment of a thick, black, undulating line that serves as a path. This path originates from the bottom left, extends towards the center, and then rises to the cyclist's starting point. Also visible is a \"V\"-shaped mark on the right, a short horizontal dash in the center right, and a cursive symbol in the bottom right. The cyclist, initially stationary, rolls forward and falls off the edge, tumbling through the air before landing on a downward-curving line. The cyclist then moves from the center right platform, descending along the undulating line towards the bottom right. As the cyclist travels, the numeral \"10\" appears in the center left of the frame, and an uppercase letter \"P\" appears in the center, both flanking the path. The cyclist eventually settles on a gap between two lines in the center right. The camera smoothly moves down and to the right, tracking the stick figure on a bicycle by moving rightward from the side. The minimalist, 2D environment features a plain, light gray background, with various abstract black markings, including a symbol resembling \">\", a musical rest symbol, the letter 'P', and the number '10', appearing in different locations within this stark, monochromatic setting. The road is depicted with simple lines, including stair-like patterns, arcs, and straight lines, forming a path with inclines, declines, and flat sections.",

    "Subject": "A black, stick-figure cyclist, rendered with pronounced simplicity, features a circular head and a solid black body. The cyclist wears a blue and red scarf, adding a touch of color. The minimalist bicycle is drawn with a single unadorned circular wheel. The scene includes other stark, black, hand-drawn style elements: a thick, undulating line; a \"V\"-shaped mark; a short horizontal dash; a cursive symbol similar to a musical mordent; an uppercase letter \"P\"; and the numeral \"10\", composed of a simple vertical line and a roughly drawn circle. The road is depicted with simple lines, including stair-like patterns, arcs, and straight lines.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video, where the camera is placed to the side capturing the scene in profile, shows a minimalist, 2D environment with a plain, light gray background. A thick, black, wavy line undulates across the screen, forming a path with inclines, declines, and flat sections. Various abstract black markings, including a symbol resembling \">\", a musical rest symbol, the letter 'P', and the number '10', appear in different locations within this stark, monochromatic setting. A small, stick-figure-like character on a bicycle navigates this drawn track.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
