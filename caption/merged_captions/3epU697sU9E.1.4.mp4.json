  "merged_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, the scene initially frames a wooden table with a smooth, polished surface that spans across the bottom of the frame and extends towards the top center from both the right and left sides. Two white sheets of paper with handwritten text are positioned in the left and center foreground on the table's surface. In the top left background, a white object, possibly a radiator, is partially visible against a pitch-black background that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera starts with a wide view of the papers on the wooden table, using deep focus to keep the scene sharp. It then slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right, moving upward and rolling clockwise to transition into an even wider view. This movement reveals two additional sheets of paper on the right side of the table, resulting in a total of four sheets of paper arranged in a neat horizontal row across the brightly lit tabletop. The initial two sheets shift toward the left of the frame as the camera movement progresses. The papers themselves remain stationary throughout the shot, while the camera's smooth motion draws attention to their arrangement and the overall composition of the scene.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, this very smooth shot uses a deep focus to keep the scene sharp. The camera starts with a wide view of several papers on a wooden table, then steadily moves upward and backward while rolling clockwise to transition into an even wider view.",
    "Subject": "The video features a wooden table with a smooth, polished surface. Initially, two sheets of white paper with handwritten text are visible on the left side of the table. As the camera moves backward slightly, two additional sheets on the right become visible, revealing a total of four sheets of paper. The focus is on the papers and their arrangement on the table.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right, revealing four sheets of paper with text laid out in a row on a wooden table. The papers themselves remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting, a camera pans slowly to the right across the surface of a brown wooden table. Several rectangular white sheets of paper, covered in what appears to be typed text, are laid out in a neat row on the table's surface. The background is pitch black, with a white object, possibly a radiator, in the upper left corner, drawing attention to the papers on the brightly lit tabletop.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide, high-angle shot, the scene initially frames a wooden table that spans across the bottom of the frame and extends towards the top center from both the right and left sides. Two white sheets of paper are positioned in the left and center foreground on the table's surface. In the top left background, a white radiator is partially visible against a black background that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera then moves upward and pulls back, with a slight pan to the right, revealing two more sheets of paper on the right side of the table. This movement shifts the initial two sheets toward the left of the frame, resulting in a final composition where four sheets of paper are arranged in a horizontal row across the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
