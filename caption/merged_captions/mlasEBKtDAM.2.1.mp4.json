  "merged_caption": "The video starts with several giant, muscular figures set against a clouded sky. A central figure is in the middle, with another to its left and one to its right, while more figures are visible in the background, and an explosion occurs in the top right. The scene then shifts to reveal a harbor in the foreground, with the lower bodies of the giant figures towering in the background. In this new composition, a seaplane is on the water in the bottom left foreground, city buildings are in the middle ground, and a ship is moored in the right foreground, all positioned below the advancing giant figures. The video begins with a static camera that exhibits noticeable shakiness, likely due to the giants shaking the ground. As one of the giants kneels, the camera tilts downward to follow the movement. The video begins with a view of several giant humanoid figures standing against a backdrop of clouds and a colorful sky. Some of the giants in the background start moving their arms before the central giant, who has a muscular build, begins to slowly raise its arms. As the giants lift their arms, they throw their heads back and eventually kneel down, with their movements not being synchronized. The camera then tilts downward, revealing a harbor with buildings and a docked ship, providing a sense of scale to the giants' massive size. The video features several colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, towering over a cityscape. The main subject is a central giant, distinguished by its massive size and prominent muscular structure, standing upright with a forward-facing posture. Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, with a fluid, similar in color to the muscles, flowing from their heads, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale.",

Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, with a fluid, similar in color to the muscles, flowing from their heads, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings is visible, emphasizing the contrast between the giants and the human-made structures. The scene conveys a dramatic juxtaposition of the immense figures against the smaller, detailed city elements.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts a dramatic outdoor scene set during the day, featuring a group of colossal figures with exposed muscle structures, towering over a landscape. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds with patches of blue visible behind them. The figures are positioned near a waterfront area with a dock, where a ship is moored. The dock is lined with buildings featuring red-tiled roofs and industrial elements, suggesting a port setting. Splashes are visible next to the boat, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall atmosphere combines natural and industrial features, with the massive figures dominating the skyline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
