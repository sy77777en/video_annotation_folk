  "merged_caption": "In a low-angle close-up shot, the legs and feet of a person are positioned in the frame bottom foreground, wearing grey pants and white athletic shoes with a black heel counter displaying a white Under Armour logo. Several rows of people are walking in unison from right to left across a manicured green lawn, their legs and feet clad in athletic trousers in shades of white, grey, and dark blue, along with golf shoes. The entire group is situated on a green lawn that occupies the bottom portion of the frame, with their movement casting long shadows toward the right. This is a static, high-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground where part of a line of people is walking. The lines recede into the distance, with other individuals wearing a mix of white, grey, and dark-colored pants, and white golf shoes with dark accents. In the blurry background, some of the people appear to be wearing blue shirts. The bright light casts long, dark shadows of the walking figures onto the vibrant green turf as the procession moves across the scene.",

    "Subject": "Several lines of people walk side by side on a manicured green lawn, viewed from a high angle at ground level that focuses on their legs and feet. The person in the immediate foreground wears grey pants and white athletic shoes with a black heel counter displaying a white Under Armour logo. To the left, another person wears white pants and white shoes. The lines recede into the distance, with other individuals wearing a mix of white, grey, and dark-colored pants, and white golf shoes with dark accents. In the blurry background, some of the people appear to be wearing blue shirts.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle perspective, several lines of people walk in unison across a manicured lawn. Their legs and feet, clad in athletic pants and shoes, move in a synchronized rhythm from the right side of the frame to the left side.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective on a manicured green lawn, a long line of people walks in unison during a bright, sunny day. The closest individuals are visible from the lower leg or knee downwards, wearing athletic trousers in shades of white, grey, and dark blue, along with golf shoes. A white shoe with a black heel and a distinct logo is prominent in the foreground. Further away, the individuals are fully visible due to the incline of the surface they are walking on. The bright light casts long, dark shadows of the walking figures onto the vibrant green turf as the procession moves across the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In a low-angle close-up shot, the legs and feet of a person are positioned in the frame bottom foreground. Several rows of people are walking in unison from right to left, and in the frame bottom, there are a few pairs of white shoes with black soles featuring a prominent logo, moving from right to left. The entire group is situated on a green lawn that occupies the bottom portion of the frame, with their movement casting long shadows toward the right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
