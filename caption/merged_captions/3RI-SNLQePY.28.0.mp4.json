  "merged_caption": "The scene features a stylized, hand-drawn gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe filled with multicolored gumballs, centered on a brown countertop that serves as an inventory bar, spanning the bottom of the frame against a flat gray background. The camera remains completely static, holding a fixed shot on the 2D animated gumball machine. In the lower left corner, a building set icon and a brown backpack icon are visible. A white arrow cursor starts to the left of the machine's central lever, then rotates the joystick clockwise, causing several multicolored gumballs to fall from a dispenser at the machine's base onto the countertop. Among the dispensed gumballs, a unique white gumball with a brown hole is highlighted. The cursor clicks on this white gumball, causing it to enlarge and move to the center of the screen, indicating that the player examined it closely. After shrinking back to its original size, the view returns to the gumball machine, where the white gumball with a brown hole is now placed in the brown collection bar at the bottom. A gray triangle-shaped exit button is located in the upper left corner of the screen. The cursor then moves to the exit button, completing the interaction.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe filled with multicolored gumballs. A metal lever is present, and a mouse icon moving in circles suggests an interactive game where the player spins the lever to release the gumballs. Among the dispensed gumballs, a unique white gumball with a brown hole is highlighted. This special gumball is enlarged and displayed prominently, indicating that the player examined it closely, before the view returns to the original scene. The focus remains on the machine and the action of dispensing the gumballs.",
    "Motion": "The mouse cursor circles the gumball machine's lever, which then rotates to dispense several multicolored gumballs onto the surface below. A white gumball with a brown hole is clicked to enlarge it and moves to the center of the screen. After shrinking back to its original size, the view returns to the gumball machine, where the white gumball with a brown hole is now placed in the brown collection bar at the bottom.",
    "Scene": "A screen recording of a software or system interface displays a stylized, hand-drawn gumball machine against a solid gray background. The light pinkish-brown machine rests on a brown countertop, its glass globe holding a small collection of colorful gumballs, including one that resembles a white gumball with a brown hole. A white arrow cursor circles the machine's lever, turning the crank to release the gumballs, which fall onto the countertop. A gray triangle-shaped exit button is located in the upper left corner of the screen, and a brown collection bar is at the bottom. Within this bar, there is a small icon resembling a building collection and a brown backpack in the lower left corner of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "The scene features a stylized gumball machine centered on a brown countertop that serves as an inventory bar, spanning the bottom of the frame against a flat gray background. In the lower left corner, a building set icon and a brown backpack icon are visible. A white arrow cursor starts to the left of the machine's central lever, then rotates the joystick clockwise, causing gumballs to fall from a dispenser at the machine's base onto the countertop. The cursor then clicks on a white gumball, causing it to enlarge and appear in a wide shot before returning to its original size. Finally, the cursor moves to the exit button located in the upper left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
