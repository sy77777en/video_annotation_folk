  "merged_caption": "This full shot is centered on a large warning sign positioned in the foreground, slightly left of the frame's center. The sign reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" and features a red triangle with an exclamation mark to signal danger, advising avoiding dusty conditions and keeping children away, as inhaling asbestos fibers may cause cancer. The sign's metal pole extends down towards the bottom of the frame. To the right of the sign, large, dark piles of tailings occupy the middle ground. In the background, reddish-brown rocky hills are visible on both the left and right sides of the frame, with a clear blue sky at the top. Sparse green shrubs are scattered throughout the middle ground. A text overlay is present in the bottom left corner, displaying \"[S] [State Library of Western Australia]\" and the year \"1978.\" The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. The video opens with a static scene dominated by the warning sign. As the camera moves smoothly and slowly forward and upward, the stillness of the environment contrasts with the camera's motion, keeping the sign as the central focus while gradually revealing more of the rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The sky is mostly clear with some clouds, indicating a sunny day. The environment suggests a remote, possibly abandoned mining area. The entire scene remains static except for the camera's movement, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves smoothly and slowly forward and upward, focusing on the warning sign in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video prominently features a warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign warns about the risks of inhaling asbestos fibers, which may cause cancer, and advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and is positioned in a natural setting with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The landscape includes reddish-brown rock formations and some green shrubs, suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment. The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.",
    "Motion": "The video opens with a static scene dominated by a warning sign that reads 'ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA,' featuring a red triangle with an exclamation mark to signal danger. The sign advises avoiding dusty conditions and keeping children away, as inhaling asbestos fibers may cause cancer. The background displays a rocky, arid landscape with sparse green shrubs under a clear blue sky. As the camera moves forward, the stillness of the environment contrasts with the camera's motion, keeping the sign as the central focus while gradually revealing more of the rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The scene is dominated by a prominent warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle and exclamation mark, cautioning about the dangers of inhaling asbestos fibers. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and stands against a backdrop of reddish-brown hills and mounds of dark, dusty material, likely tailings. The sky is mostly clear with some clouds, indicating a sunny day. The environment suggests a remote, possibly abandoned mining area. Overlay elements include a small watermark in the bottom left corner, displaying text that reads \"[S] [State Library of Western Australia]\" and the year \"1978\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
