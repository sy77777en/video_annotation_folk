  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured at subject level, the scene opens with a checkered crosswalk occupying the foreground and middle ground. A man with dark skin tone, wearing a green jacket and blue jeans, walks from the right middle ground towards the left, while a yellow taxi is visible in the right background. An animated logo appears in the top center and drops onto the crosswalk in the foreground, transforming its pattern into a white, maze-like design. The camera, starting with a high angle and transitioning to a level angle, moves forward and pans left, revealing a woman in a green and yellow outfit in the midground, who transitions into a pink cartoon character in the left foreground. Another figure, initially a person with dark skin tone in a blurred hoodie and dark yellow jacket, transforms into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket and blue pants. In the midground, a man in a suit with a white shirt and red tie walks towards the camera, passing by a flower stand filled with colorful flowers. The camera continues forward, crossing the street with noticeable shaking. The setting is outdoors, featuring a city street lined with modern buildings of varying colors, including beige, red, and blue facades. Sidewalks are adorned with flower stands, and a few pedestrians are present, contributing to the urban atmosphere. Overlay elements, including text and icons related to digital brushes, appear in the top right corner, indicating a creative or augmented reality aspect. The scene blends real and animated elements, creating a dynamic visual contrast, with pedestrians transforming into colorful animated characters, adding a whimsical element.",

Further back, a man in a suit with a white shirt and red tie is walking towards the camera in front of a flower stand filled with colorful flowers. The scene blends real and animated elements, creating a dynamic visual contrast.",
    "Motion": "A man in a green jacket and blue jeans walks across a checkered crosswalk on a city street, with a yellow taxi in the background. As he walks, an animated logo appears and transforms the crosswalk into a maze-like pattern. The camera moves forward and pans to the left, revealing a woman in a green and yellow outfit in the midground, who transitions into a pink cartoon character. Another figure, initially a person, transforms into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket.

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a city street lined with modern buildings of varying colors, including beige, red, and blue facades. The street is marked with a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern at a crosswalk. A yellow taxi is moving forward along the road. Sidewalks are adorned with flower stands, and a few pedestrians are present, contributing to the urban atmosphere. During the video, an overlay element drops to the ground, causing the ground pattern to become maze-like. Notably, the video includes pedestrians transforming into colorful animated characters, adding a whimsical element. Overlay elements are present, including text and icons related to digital brushes, positioned in the upper right corner, indicating a creative or augmented reality aspect.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot captured at subject level, the scene opens with a checkered crosswalk occupying the foreground and middle ground. A man walks from the right middle ground towards the left, while a yellow taxi is visible in the right background. An animated logo appears in the top center and drops onto the crosswalk in the foreground, transforming its pattern into a white, maze-like design. As this happens, the camera pans left and moves forward. A woman enters from the left middle ground, walking towards the camera, and transforms into a 2D animated character in the left foreground. Other pedestrians, including a man in a suit and a man in a yellow jacket, are visible in the center and right middle ground, walking towards the camera. The man in the yellow jacket is also transformed into a 2D animated headless figure. A user interface element for \"Brushes\" appears in the top right corner of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
