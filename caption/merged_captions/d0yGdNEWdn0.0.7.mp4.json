  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short brown hair, a receding hairline, a mustache, and a goatee standing in the center of the frame on a wooden stage in the middle ground. He is wearing a light-colored button-down shirt, dark trousers, and a lanyard with an ID card. The man stands in place, gesturing with his hands as he speaks. A large projection screen spans both the middle ground and the background on the right, displaying a slide featuring a black-and-white photograph of a smiling young boy with light, wavy hair, an image of a vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder, and the text \"11 Years-Old\" and \"Hypnopaedia\". In the background, a large white banner with the \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" logo is visible on the left side of the frame, positioned on the wall. In the middle ground, the lower body of an audience member wearing dark trousers and shoes is visible in the bottom left, seated with legs crossed, while a lectern with the \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" logo is situated in the bottom right foreground. The audience members in the front row remain seated and motionless. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. It uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the audience in the foreground to the speaker in the middle ground and the screen in the background, sharp and clear. The walls of the hall are covered in light-colored, grid-patterned panels, completing the setting of the lecture hall where the presentation is taking place.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
