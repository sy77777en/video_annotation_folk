  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man stands still in the left half of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a vast green field that extends into the background. He is wearing a tattered black suit jacket, a disheveled white collared shirt, and dark trousers, with a dark, askew tie visible at his neck. His head is completely covered by a light-colored, textured wrapping that obscures all facial features. The suit jacket is torn on the cuff of the right sleeve and the upper arm area of the left sleeve. The man stands completely motionless in the grassy field. A large, dark, out-of-focus shape occupies the foreground on the right, partially obscuring the scene. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down, in a static, high-angle shot from eye level. It uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the man in the midground. The outdoor scene unfolds in a vast, mown field of green grass under daylight, presented with a desaturated, cool-toned color palette.",

    "Subject": "A man stands wearing a tattered black suit jacket, a disheveled white collared shirt, and dark trousers. A dark, askew tie is visible at his neck. His head is completely covered by a light-colored, textured wrapping that obscures all facial features. He stands still, facing forward with his arms at his sides.

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds in a vast, mown field of green grass under daylight. The view is partially obstructed by a large, dark, out-of-focus shape in the foreground on the right. In the middle ground to the left, a solitary figure stands still, dressed in a tattered black suit and a white shirt. The figure's head is concealed by a light-colored, textured covering. The entire scene is presented with a desaturated, cool-toned color palette.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
