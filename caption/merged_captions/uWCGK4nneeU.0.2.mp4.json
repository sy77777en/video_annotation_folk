  "merged_caption": "In a dynamic full shot, a large, derelict aircraft carrier is positioned centrally in the middle ground, its massive hull extending across the width of the frame. The ship's long, metallic hull is partially submerged in a dune, with its exterior a mix of rusted, reddish-brown plating and weathered grey sections, marked with faded white diagonal stripes. The bridge is perched at a severe angle atop the larger hull section, and the entire vessel shows signs of significant damage, with abandoned aircraft scattered around its base. The camera smoothly moves to the right from a ground-level perspective, capturing the scene's dynamic effect. A smaller, broken section of the ship rests on top of the main wreckage, slightly to the right of the center. In the foreground, rocky formations and sand are visible at the bottom left and bottom right corners. The background is composed of distant, pale mountains that stretch across the horizon, situated below the clear, pale blue sky at the top of the frame. The scene is set under a bright sun, casting a dark shadow from the shipwreck onto the sand. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire desert landscape, from the foreground rocks to the distant mountains, sharp and clear. The video captures a vast, sun-drenched desert landscape characterized by brownish-white sand dunes, with the derelict shipwreck half-buried in the sand, enhancing the scene's dynamic effect as the camera moves rightward, offering a comprehensive view of the shipwreck and its surroundings.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed from a ground-level perspective captures a vast, sun-drenched desert landscape characterized by brownish-white sand dunes and distant, pale mountains. Partially buried in the sand lies the massive, derelict hull of a ship, its rusted red-brown and grey metal contrasting with horizontal white stripes. The vessel is broken, with a smaller superstructure resting askew atop the main wreckage. The scene is set under a clear, pale blue sky during the day, with the bright sun casting a dark shadow from the shipwreck onto the sand.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
