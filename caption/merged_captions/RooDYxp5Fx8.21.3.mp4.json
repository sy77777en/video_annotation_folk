  "merged_caption": "The video captures a quiet city street with no main subject, focusing on the overall scenery. Initially, the foreground in the lower right corner features a red-and-white striped table displaying various small items, and the mid-ground on the right side shows a shop with large windows and warm yellow lighting, displaying pottery and art pieces inside. As the camera, positioned at eye level, moves forward and trucks left while panning left, the shops on both sides extend from the foreground to the hills rising in the background, while the street at the bottom of the frame stretches from the foreground to the background. The camera maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, and uses deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp with a large depth of field. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout. The street is lined with traditional Japanese buildings featuring neutral tones, wooden accents, and tiled roofs. Overhead, utility poles and wires stretch across the road, leading the viewer’s eye toward the green hills and leafy trees under a clear blue sky. The environment is clean and well-kept, with smooth gray pavement indicating daytime. A few signs with Japanese text are visible, and the street stretches gently uphill, flanked by low-rise structures. In the distance, green hills rise beyond the end of the street, adding natural color to the scene. The camera continues with only a forward movement in the same direction, maintaining a consistent height at street level. The overall atmosphere is calm and orderly, with no overlays or digital elements present.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp with a large depth of field. The camera first moves forward and trucks left while panning left, then continues with only a forward movement in the same direction. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet street lined with traditional-style buildings featuring neutral tones and wooden accents. The scene includes a shop with large windows warmly lit from within, and a table draped in a red-and-white striped cloth displaying various items outside.

    "Motion": "The video features a quiet street scene in what appears to be a traditional Japanese neighborhood. There are small shops and a table with goods displayed outside, covered with a red and white cloth. The street is empty, and the background includes green hills under a clear blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a quiet, outdoor street lined with traditional Japanese buildings. The environment is clean and well-kept, with smooth gray pavement and a clear blue sky indicating daytime. On one side, a shop with large windows and warm yellow lighting displays pottery and art pieces inside, while outside, a table covered in a red-and-white striped cloth holds various small items. The street is bordered by low-rise structures with neutral-colored facades, wooden accents, and tiled roofs. Overhead, power lines stretch across the road, and a few signs with Japanese text are visible. In the distance, green hills rise beyond the end of the street, and leafy trees add natural color to the scene. No overlays or digital elements are present, and the overall atmosphere is calm and orderly.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a quiet city street with no main subject, focusing on the overall scenery.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
