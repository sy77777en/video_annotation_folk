  "merged_caption": "A full shot consistently frames a snowboarder near the center foreground, with only slight lateral movements relative to the camera. The scene features a snow-covered slope extending from the foreground into the background, with evergreen trees passing by in the foreground and scattered throughout the middle and background. A sliver of dark blue sky is visible at the top of the frame in the background. As the snowboarder moves down the slope, the camera, held at his level, maintains the full shot, keeping him near the center foreground. In the initial shot, snow mist rises dynamically in the foreground and then disperses into the middle ground around him. The snowboarder carves down a steep, snow-covered mountain, kicking up a large spray of powder. The level-angle or low-angle camera, moving in sync with the snowboarder, tilts and shakes as he turns from side to side, navigating the deep snow on the slope. This is a selfie-style shot taken by a snowboarder, with the camera held at eye level to capture a level or low-angle view from the front. The camera moves backward, leading the snowboarder down the slope. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus with a large depth of field keeps both the subject and the snowy background sharp. A man with a long, thick, light-colored beard and mustache, both completely covered in white frost and ice, is shown from a level or low-angle perspective. He wears a bright red and black hooded winter jacket over dark snow pants. On his hands are black and white gloves, which are also covered in snow. He has on large, reflective ski goggles with a multi-colored lens, and a small action camera is mounted on his head. He is skiing on dark skis and wears a gray knit hat. His backpack is entirely black. The outdoor scene is set on a bright, sunny day under a clear, deep blue sky. Evergreen trees are scattered across the snowy landscape. As the snowboarder glides through deep powder, a burst of snow rises around him, leaving a winding trail in the snow behind.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed and faces them, captures the dynamic motion of snowboarding down a steep, snow-covered mountain.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
