  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed over the shoulder of a person whose blurred profile occupies the foreground on the left. The main subject, a middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark hair graying at the temples and a short, graying beard and mustache, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center. He is wearing a black suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a black tie, with a small white bandage on his forehead above his right eyebrow and a gold-colored watch on his left wrist. The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, modern space characterized by cool ambient lighting, with long, horizontal light fixtures visible in the dark, out-of-focus background. The man initially holds his left hand near his chin before lowering it, maintaining a somber expression as he looks slightly down and to his left. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, employing an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in sharp focus. The shot is slightly unsteady, enhancing the intimate and contemplative atmosphere.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, modern space characterized by cool ambient lighting. In the dark, out-of-focus background, long, horizontal light fixtures are visible. The shot is framed from over the shoulder of an out-of-focus figure in the foreground, looking towards a man in a black suit and tie. The man has a small white bandage on his forehead and a gold-colored watch on his wrist.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
