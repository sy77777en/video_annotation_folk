  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where an animated man with black, spiky hair, wearing a white shirt under a black, open jacket with a cape-like quality, grey slim-fitting pants, and black shoes, is initially a small figure in the top center background, running down a narrow, dimly lit alleyway towards the camera. The alleyway's right brick wall occupies the right side of the frame, and the left wall with windows is on the left, both extending from foreground to background. Through the left windows, a green-tinged parking area with white painted lines is visible in the middle ground. The ground is a dark, paved surface. As the man runs forward, his cape-like jacket flutters behind him, and the shot transitions to a medium close-up, with the man now in the center foreground. The alley walls shift to the middle ground on the left and right, and the alley's opening, revealing distant city buildings silhouetted against a pale orange sky, becomes visible in the center background. The camera, initially positioned at an overhead level (around second-floor height) with a high angle, moves down to eye level and tilts up, resulting in a level angle. As the man continues to run closer to the camera, his expression becomes more visible, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth indicating a look of surprise or concern. The camera's movement and the man's approach bring his facial features into focus, enhancing the sense of urgency in the scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at an overhead level (around second-floor height) with a high angle, then moves down to eye level and tilts up, resulting in a level angle. ",
    "Subject": "The video features an animated man with black, spiky hair. He is depicted wearing a white shirt under a black, open jacket that has a cape-like quality, flaring out behind him. His attire is completed with grey, slim-fitting pants and black shoes. The character's design is stylized, with notably thin limbs.",
    "Motion": "The man is running along a narrow alleyway, with a wall featuring large windows on his right and a row of brown brick walls on his left. As he runs, his cape-like jacket flutters behind him. In the background, distant high-rise buildings are visible, while on the man's right, a parking lot with marked spaces can be seen through the windows. The man continues to run closer to the camera, his expression becoming more visible. As he approaches, his facial features, including his wide eyes and slightly open mouth, indicate a look of surprise or concern.",
    "Scene": "The video, observed from an objective viewpoint, shows a figure running through a narrow, dimly lit alleyway. The ground is a dark, paved surface. To the right is a reddish-brown brick wall, and to the left, a dark gray wall with multiple rectangular windows. Through these windows, a green-tinged parking area with white painted lines is visible. The alley opens up to a view of distant city buildings silhouetted against a pale orange sky.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where an animated man is initially a small figure in the top center background, running down a narrow alleyway towards the camera. The alleyway's right brick wall occupies the right side of the frame, and the left wall with windows is on the left, both extending from foreground to background.

The alley walls shift to the middle ground on the left and right, and the alley's opening, revealing distant city buildings against a pale sky, becomes visible in the center background. The camera, initially positioned above the subject, changes to be at the subject's level by the end of the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
