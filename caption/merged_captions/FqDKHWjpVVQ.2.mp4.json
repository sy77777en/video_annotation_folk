  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, beginning at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, before transitioning to eye level as it moves. Initially, a dark, angular military vehicle, marked as a target with orange and blue digital icons and decreasing numbers, is positioned slightly right of center in the background. The player's perspective moves forward along a dirt road lined with trees and simple, light-colored buildings, some appearing worn. In the foreground, two white, four-door sedans are parked next to each other on the right side of the road, with the sedan closer to the viewer facing right and the one farther away facing left. Game interface elements are fixed: a minimap in the bottom left foreground and health/ammo indicators in the bottom right foreground. Orange objective markers are superimposed, one on the left in the middle ground and one on the target vehicle. As the viewpoint advances forward and slightly right, then more directly forward, the target military vehicle shifts to slightly right of center in the middle ground, becoming larger in the frame. The player appears to jump from a high area down to the street, with a large, dark, satellite-like object spinning on top of the vehicle. Both stationary white sedans move towards the right edge of the frame and then exit. The objective marker on the left moves towards the right side of the frame but remains on the left side. By the end of the clip, the target military vehicle is positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground, closer to the viewpoint. The camera maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, and utilizes deep focus, keeping a large depth of field, with unsteady movement and noticeable shaking.",

    "Camera": "The camera begins at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, before transitioning to eye level as it moves. The camera maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, and utilizes deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The footage is from a first-person game perspective, showing the player running down a slope and into a parking lot. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark, angular military vehicle, possibly an armored truck with a mounted weapon system, is prominent in the midground, moving along a dirt road. This vehicle is marked with orange and blue digital icons, including numbers that decrease (e.g., \"30\", \"23\", \"16\") and the word \"ATTACK,\" indicating it as a target. To the right of the road, two stationary white, four-door sedans are parked. The sedan closer to the viewer is facing right, while the one farther away is facing left. In the foreground, elements of a game interface are visible: a minimap in the bottom left corner displays a blue arrow and other icons, with green subtitles positioned next to the blue map; health and ammunition indicators in the bottom right show \"100%\" and \"101/101\" in a blue digital font; and additional orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"103\" and \"86\" are superimposed on structures in the distance. A partial view of another vehicle, with a white body and blue from floating game icons, is seen in the bottom right foreground.",
    "Motion": "In a first-person video game scene, the player's perspective moves forward along a dirt road lined with trees and buildings. As the player advances, they appear to jump from a high area down to the street, with a military vehicle becoming more central in view. A large, dark, satellite-like object spins on top of the vehicle, adding context to the scene. The vehicle's target indicators and decreasing numbers highlight it as the primary objective. The player approaches the vehicle, passing by parked sedans and debris scattered on the road. The target indicators and decreasing numbers remain visible, emphasizing the vehicle's importance as the player gets closer. The player finally reaches the vehicle, with the target indicators and decreasing numbers clearly visible, indicating the vehicle's status as the main target.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a sunlit, outdoor urban environment. The setting is a dusty, unpaved road flanked by simple, light-colored buildings, some appearing worn. Palm trees and other green vegetation are visible. Two white sedans are parked on the right side of the road. In the center of the road, a dark, boxy, turreted military-like object with glowing orange and blue elements is approached. Scattered debris, including wooden crates, litters the ground. The sky is clear. Overlay elements include a mini-map and green text in the bottom left; targeting reticles, orange diamond icons with numbers, and the word \"ATTACK\" near the center; and a blue numerical display in the bottom right. Additional orange diamond icons with numbers are visible near buildings on the left.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective. Initially, a dark military vehicle, marked as a target, is positioned slightly right of center in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
