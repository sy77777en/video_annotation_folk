  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot that begins with the Gojo Station entrance positioned in the center-right middle ground. The camera moves smoothly forward while subtly panning right and tilting upward to focus on the modern, gray, arched subway entrance, marked with signs in Japanese and English. The upward tilt causes the camera angle to shift from level to low. To the left, a sidewalk stretches from the foreground into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings, one of which has a traditional wooden storefront. A bicycle with a green delivery bag is parked in the bottom-left foreground. On the right side of the frame, a delivery truck and a red and blue circular traffic sign occupy the middle ground. In the background, visible through the station's opening and beyond the street, are more buildings and distant green mountains under a clear blue sky. The scene unfolds on a bright, sunny day, with pedestrians walking along the sidewalk on the left and a cyclist moving along the pavement. Cars pass by on the road, contributing to the bustling urban environment. An overlay in the lower center of the scene displays a sun icon with the text '35°C / 95 F' and 'Sunny weather'. The camera slowly and steadily moves forward, pushing in towards the station entrance, which causes the elements in the frame to grow larger. The urban atmosphere is highlighted, with the vibrant street scene capturing the essence of a city street in Japan.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a bright, sunny day on a city street in front of Gojo Station in Japan. The camera slowly moves toward the modern, gray, arched subway entrance, which is marked with signs in Japanese and English. The sidewalk to the left is lined with multi-story buildings, one of which has a traditional wooden storefront. On the right, a delivery truck is parked near a red and blue circular traffic sign. In the background, more buildings and a distant green mountain are visible under a clear blue sky. Pedestrians walk along the pavement, and a bicycle with a green delivery bag is parked in the foreground. An overlay in the lower center of the scene displays a sun icon with the text '35°C / 95 F' and 'Sunny weather'.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
