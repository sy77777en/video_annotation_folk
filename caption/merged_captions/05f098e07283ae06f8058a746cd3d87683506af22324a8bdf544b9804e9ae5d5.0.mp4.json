  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a lush forest landscape, captured from a drone's perspective. The scene is framed to include a dense array of trees and foliage, occupying the majority of the frame. The waterfall is positioned slightly off-center, towards the lower-middle ground, and is partially visible amidst the greenery. The trees are distributed across the frame, with taller ones on the left and right, creating a natural border. The camera maintains a consistent height above the scene, providing an aerial view that emphasizes the scale and depth of the forest. The video begins with an aerial view of a dense forest, with tall trees and lush greenery covering the landscape. The camera, at a high angle, looks down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field to capture the entire scene sharply. As the camera slowly moves downward and forward, a waterfall becomes visible in the distance, cascading down a rocky cliff into a small pool below. The waterfall is surrounded by dense foliage, and the water appears to be flowing steadily. The camera continues to move forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the pool it feeds into, which is partially obscured by the surrounding trees. The scene transitions smoothly, slightly adjusting its angle to reveal more of the waterfall and surrounding vegetation, enhancing the sense of immersion in the natural environment. The setting is outdoors, characterized by a steep, wooded landscape with a waterfall cascading down rocky terrain into a small pool below. The time of day appears to be mid-afternoon, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the ground. Notable visual elements include the varying shades of green from the leaves, the rough texture of the tree bark, and the smooth, reflective surface of the water.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene sharply. The camera moves smoothly forward and downward, focusing on the waterfall amidst the dense forest.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a lush landscape scenery shot, showcasing a vibrant forest filled with a diverse array of trees and foliage. The focus is on the rich environment and the interplay of light filtering through the canopy, creating a serene atmosphere. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the scale and beauty of the natural surroundings, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the tranquility of the scene rather than concentrating on a specific object. The cascading waterfall, partially visible amidst the greenery, adds a dynamic element, enhancing the overall sense of peace and connection to nature.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
