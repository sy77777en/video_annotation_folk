  "merged_caption": "In a medium tracking shot, a man with short hair, wearing a dark jacket with his hands in the pockets, is consistently framed in the center of the foreground as he walks forward along a narrow urban alleyway. The camera, positioned at the man's level, moves forward at the same pace, maintaining a constant distance and keeping him centered in the shot. The alley walls, lined with textured brick and tiled surfaces, extend from the foreground to the background, creating strong leading lines that converge toward the center. The ground is concrete, wet with scattered debris and puddles, suggesting recent rain. Overhead, fire escapes add to the urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused light casting soft shadows. As the man progresses, the intersection becomes more prominent in the center of the middle ground, revealing a street where a bus moves from left to right and other pedestrians walk. The scene transitions smoothly as the character walks through the alley, moving towards a brighter street visible at the end, where more modern buildings and a stop sign can be seen. The camera features a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field, and moves forward with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. As the man walks steadily, the bus gradually moves out of the frame. The alleyway remains consistent in appearance, with the man moving closer to the brighter end of the alley. The focus remains on the man as he walks, with the surroundings providing context to his movement.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera moves forward, following a man from behind, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body and occupying about half of the frame’s height. He is wearing a dark jacket with his hands in the pockets, and the collar of his jacket is flipped up. He has short hair. The alley is narrow, with tall buildings on either side, and the man is moving towards the brighter end of the alley. The focus remains on the man as he walks, with the surroundings providing context to his movement.",
    "Motion": "A man with short hair, wearing a dark jacket with his hands in the pockets, walks forward in a narrow alleyway. The alley is flanked by tall buildings with weathered and modern facades, and the ground is wet with scattered debris. As the man walks, a bus appears in the distance and moves past him from left to right. The man continues walking steadily, and the bus gradually moves out of the frame. The alleyway remains consistent in appearance, with the man moving closer to the brighter end of the alley.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character from shoulder height, set in a narrow urban alleyway. The environment is outdoors, with tall buildings on either side, creating a confined space. The alley is lined with textured brick walls, one side featuring signs of wear, while the other has a more uniform, tiled appearance. The ground is concrete, with scattered debris and puddles suggesting recent rain. Overhead, fire escapes add to the urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused light casting soft shadows. The scene transitions smoothly as the character walks through the alley, moving towards a brighter street visible at the end, where more modern buildings and a stop sign can be seen. A bus passes by on the perpendicular street at the end of the alley.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
