  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a young woman with fair skin and long, reddish-brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, shown from the chest up, in the left foreground, where she remains for the duration of the scene. She wears a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt over a pink top, with a black bag strap over her right shoulder and a black wristband on her right wrist. In the middle ground, a white mantelpiece stretches across the frame, holding a rugby ball marked with \"PHYS ED\" and \"MLC\" in the center-right, flanked by several silver and gold trophies, books, and a framed photo of a sports team on the far right. The background features a signed whiteboard with \"CARE PARK\" written at the top in the top center. The scene is set indoors in a room with white brick walls and cool, ambient lighting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep both the girl in the foreground and the trophies on the shelf behind her relatively sharp. The camera is quite unsteady, suggesting a handheld perspective, but its motion lacks a clear, intentional pattern. Throughout the video, the young woman smiles while looking down, then transitions into a laugh, looking up and raising her left hand to cover her mouth. The camera's noticeable shaking continues throughout the scene, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a room with white brick walls and cool, ambient lighting. A white mantelpiece serves as a display for various sports memorabilia, including several silver and gold trophies, a rugby ball marked with \"PHYS ED\" and \"MLC,\" a framed photo of a sports team, and a small collection of books. Above the shelf, a white board with \"CARE PARK\" written at the top is covered in numerous signatures.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
