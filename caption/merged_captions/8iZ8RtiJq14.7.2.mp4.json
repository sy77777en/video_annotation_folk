  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full view of a translucent red thumbtack with a round head in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame, pushed through a small white piece of paper into a light brown, marbled surface. A twisted red string is wrapped around the base of the thumbtack's head, extending toward the right. The camera glides smoothly forward with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing primarily on the red thumbtacks and string in the foreground, while both the area closest to the camera and the background are heavily blurred. As the camera moves, the focus shifts along the red string, creating a dynamic and engaging visual journey. The first red thumbtack exits the frame from the left, and the second red thumbtack comes into view in the foreground on the right side, pinned to a grayish-white piece of paper in the bottom-right corner. The red string seamlessly connects the thumbtacks, passing over a yellow note on the marbled surface that clearly displays the text \"$2k for $10k.\" The camera's focus continues to shift, following the path of the red string from one pinned note to another, leaving the surrounding elements blurred. Several red, translucent thumbtacks are pushed into small pieces of white and yellow paper, creating a network across the board. Overlay white text \"[4]\" appears in the bottom left corner of the frame. The camera remains at the same height as the subjects throughout the video, with occasional shifts in the subject of focus, enhancing the visual narrative as it explores the interconnected elements on the surface resembling a marbled tabletop or a corkboard.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, forward-moving shot with an extremely shallow depth of field. The focus remains primarily on the red thumbtacks and string in the foreground, while both the area closest to the camera and the background are heavily blurred. There are occasional shifts in the subject of focus.",
    "Subject": "A translucent red thumbtack with a round head is pushed through a small white piece of paper into a light brown, marbled surface. A twisted red string is wrapped around the base of the thumbtack's head. The camera's focus shifts, moving along the red string as it stretches across the surface, leading towards other thumbtacks and small pieces of paper. One piece of paper is yellow and clearly displays the text \"$2k for $10k.\"",
    "Motion": "The camera glides over a red string, seamlessly connecting a red thumbtack to another in the background, while passing over a yellow note on the marbled surface, creating a dynamic and engaging visual journey.",
    "Scene": "The camera moves across a surface resembling a marbled tabletop or a corkboard. Several red, translucent thumbtacks are pushed into small pieces of white and yellow paper. A thin, twisted red string connects the thumbtacks, creating a network across the board. The camera's focus shifts, following the path of the red string from one pinned note to another, leaving the surrounding elements blurred. Overlay white text \"[4]\" appears in the bottom left corner of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full view of a red thumbtack in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame. A red string extends from this thumbtack toward the right, leading to out-of-focus papers and another thumbtack. As the camera moves, the focus shifts along the red string, and the first red thumbtack exits the frame from the left. The second red thumbtack comes into view in the foreground on the right side, pinned to a grayish-white piece of paper in the bottom-right corner. The camera remains at the same height as the subjects throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
