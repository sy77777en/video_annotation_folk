  "merged_caption": "A full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, captures a herd of light brown Asian elephants initially standing still and grazing on the grass at the edge of a dense, green jungle during the daytime. In the middle ground, one large elephant is positioned on the left, partially framed by a leafy branch in the top-left foreground, facing left in profile. Another large elephant, positioned more centrally and mainly facing to the left, has a patch of dark mud on its back. Clustered near this central adult are at least three very small baby elephants; two are partially visible behind the adult's rear legs, and another is near its front legs. The bottom of the frame is filled with tall, vibrant green grass and low-lying vegetation in the foreground, with a thick wall of trees with dark green leaves creating a lush backdrop. The entire herd, including two adults and three small calves, initially stands still, grazing on the grass, before gradually starting to move slowly from right to left across the grassy area. Two of the small calves walk closely alongside an adult, while another calf lags behind, continuing to eat. This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from a level, eye-level perspective, with the camera using a deep focus to keep the herd of elephants and the surrounding jungle environment in sharp detail. The scene unfolds with minimal camera movement, capturing the gradual motion of the elephants as they traverse the static frame.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds at the edge of a dense, green jungle during the daytime. The foreground is filled with tall, vibrant green grass and low-lying vegetation. In the background, a thick wall of trees with dark green leaves creates a lush backdrop. A family of light-brown elephants, including two adults and three small calves, is present in the grassy clearing. Initially, the calves are standing and eating grass before they slowly begin walking toward the left. One of the adult elephants has a patch of dark mud on its back. A leafy branch hangs in the foreground, partially framing the scene.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, captures a herd of elephants initially standing still and grazing on the grass. In the middle ground, one large elephant is positioned on the left, partially framed by a leafy branch in the top-left foreground. Another large elephant and several small calves are located in the center-right middle ground. The bottom of the frame is filled with green grass in the foreground, with a dense jungle occupying the background. The entire herd initially stands still, grazing on the grass, before gradually starting to move toward the left across the static frame, with minimal camera movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
