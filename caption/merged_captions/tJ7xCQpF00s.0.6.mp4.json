  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, looking down a narrow urban alley that occupies the center of the frame. The alley extends from the foreground to a brightly lit opening in the background. The scene is framed by tall building walls on the left and right. A line of dumpsters is positioned along the left side, starting in the foreground with a container that has an orange lid and extending into the middle ground with a prominent blue dumpster. The wet pavement in the foreground and middle ground has several puddles. A large orange metal sheet is located in the foreground at the bottom right corner of the frame. A yellow curb runs along the base of the wall at the right-center of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. The camera is at an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire alley in sharp detail. It moves slowly and smoothly forward down the wet, narrow alleyway, capturing the gritty urban environment. Most of the scene remains still, but there is a pedestrian walking towards the left side of the frame in the distance. The pavement is wet and uneven, with puddles reflecting the bright light coming from the sky at the far end of the passage. The scene is characterized by a cool, desaturated, teal-toned color palette, creating a contrast between the shadowy foreground and the brightly lit exit of the alley. The ground is slick with rainwater, forming puddles that reflect the dim, cool-toned light, while numerous large dumpsters and trash bins line the path, adding to the gritty, neglected atmosphere. The focus is entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the moody, cinematic quality and the stark contrast between the dark foreground and the distant light.",

    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow, and wet urban alleyway. The scene is framed by the towering, shadowy walls of adjacent buildings, creating a strong sense of confinement that leads the eye toward a brightly lit opening in the far distance. The ground is slick with rainwater, forming puddles that reflect the dim, cool-toned light, while numerous large dumpsters and trash bins line the path, adding to the gritty, neglected atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the moody, cinematic quality and the stark contrast between the dark foreground and the distant light.",
    "Motion": "This is an atmospheric scenery shot of a dark, wet city alleyway. The camera moves forward slightly, capturing the gritty urban environment. Most of the scene remains still, but there is a pedestrian walking towards the left side of the frame in the distance.",
    "Scene": "A view from an eye-level perspective looks down a narrow, dark urban alley flanked by the tall, dark walls of adjacent buildings. The pavement is wet and uneven, with puddles reflecting the bright light coming from the sky at the far end of the passage. Large trash dumpsters, including a prominent blue one and another with an orange lid, are lined up along the left side. The scene is characterized by a cool, desaturated, teal-toned color palette, creating a contrast between the shadowy foreground and the brightly lit exit of the alley. A yellow-painted curb runs along the base of the wall on the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
