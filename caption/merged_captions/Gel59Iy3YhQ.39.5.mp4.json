  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot initially frames a small, pixelated, dark character wearing a red top on a central mountaintop, which extends from the bottom center foreground to the center middle ground. The character stretches out both arms and lets them hang down, then raises the right hand near the head as snow falls continuously. A large, solid blue moon occupies the top right background, with a colorful aurora in shades of blue and teal spanning the upper frame against a purple backdrop, and a purple landscape stretching below, all located in the background. White pixels representing falling snow drift across the entire scene. A white, rectangular speech bubble with a pointed tail appears as an overlay in the center, directly above the character, containing the black, pixelated, all-caps text \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\". The camera then smoothly cranes upward, vertically circling around the character to reveal more of the surrounding aurora-filled sky, causing the moon to exit the frame. Concurrently, the first speech bubble vanishes and is replaced by a second one in the same central location with the lowercase text \"hello?\". The entire scene is viewed from a high angle, looking down upon the character.",

    "Subject": "A small, pixelated, dark character wearing a red top stands on the peak of a snowy, blueish-purple mountain. Above this figure, a white, rectangular speech bubble with a pointed tail appears, containing the black, pixelated, all-caps text \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\". Subsequently, the text within the speech bubble changes to the lowercase word \"hello?\".",
    "Motion": "In a pixelated scene, a character initially stretches out both arms and lets them hang down, then raises the right hand near the head atop a mountain as snow falls continuously. A speech bubble appears above the character, displaying the text \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\". The speech bubble then disappears, and another speech bubble appears with the text \"hello?\".",
    "Scene": "In a gaming video with a high-angle view, the scene is set on a snowy, blue-hued mountaintop at night. The pixelated sky features a large, solid blue moon in the upper right, which then moves out of frame as the camera shifts. The sky is filled with a wavy aurora in shades of blue and teal against a purple backdrop. White pixels representing falling snow drift across the entire scene. Below the peak, a vast landscape stretches out in shades of purple and pink. An overlay of a white speech bubble appears above a character on the peak; the text inside first reads \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\" and then disappears, followed by another speech bubble appearing with the text \"hello?\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
