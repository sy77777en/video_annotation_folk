  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of several low-poly figures in a dimly lit, dark indoor environment. In the foreground on the left, only the arms and hands of a figure are visible in front of a desk. A computer monitor emits a glow in the right foreground, which disappears from view as the camera moves forward. The camera, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, smoothly dollies past the foreground figure, revealing a man with faceted hands positioned as if on a keyboard in the middle ground, left of center. He sits in profile at his own desk, facing right, with a monitor emitting a glow next to an orange cup on the right side of the frame. Further back, a woman with long, faceted hair is positioned in profile on a dark chair, also at a desk, facing a glowing computer monitor. The figures are rendered in a geometric, sculptural style, with visible flat planes making up their forms. As the camera continues to move forward, transitioning into a full shot, it reveals more of the background figure and the surrounding dark environment, which is predominantly black, contrasted by a thin red light strip running along the base of the furniture. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, providing a clear view of the spatial relationships between the figures: the partially visible figure in the foreground, the man in the middle ground, and the woman in the background.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus that keeps both the foreground and background figures clear. The camera moves forward smoothly, dollying past two low-poly figures—one in the foreground and another in the middle ground—before revealing a figure sitting at a desk in the background.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, three light-gray, low-polygon figures are shown sitting at desks. In the very foreground, a figure is partially visible from the side, with only the arms shown in the frame. Further back, a second figure, a man, is seen from behind and to the right, with his faceted hands positioned as if on a keyboard. In the very background, a woman, identifiable by her long, faceted hair, sits in profile on a dark chair. She is also positioned at a desk, facing a glowing computer monitor. All figures are rendered in a geometric, sculptural style, with visible flat planes making up their forms.",
    "Motion": "The camera gradually moves forward, transitioning from a partial view of the first person's arms in the foreground to reveal the second and third figures situated in the middle and background, all low-polygon figures seated at desks in a dimly lit room.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, indoor environment where three white, low-poly figures are present. In the foreground, only the arm of one figure is visible. A man is seated in the middleground, while a woman with long hair is positioned further back. The figures have a faceted, geometric, statue-like appearance. The surrounding space is predominantly black, contrasted by a thin red light strip running along the base of the furniture.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of several low-poly figures. A figure is positioned in the foreground on the left, with only its arms and hands visible in front of a desk. In the right foreground, a computer monitor emits a glow, which disappears from view as the camera moves forward. In the middle ground, left of center, a man with long hair sits in profile at his own desk, facing right, with a monitor emitting a glow next to an orange cup on the right side of the frame. A woman is positioned further back. The camera then moves forward, transitioning into a full shot. This movement reveals more of the background figure and the surrounding dark environment. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
