  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot, presented as a wide shot from a first-person point of view within a 3D game environment. Initially, the frame is dominated by a narrow, dimly lit corridor with light-colored, rectangular tiles lining the walls, reflecting a faint greenish hue from the ambient lighting. The corridor is partially submerged in dark, rippling water that fills the bottom half of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. The camera, positioned above the water at eye level, looks straight ahead with a level angle, employing deep focus to maintain a large depth of field. It moves forward with unsteady, noticeable shaking, enhancing the immersive experience. As the scene progresses, the corridor walls recede, and the view transitions into a larger, water-filled room, maintaining the overall dark and enclosed atmosphere. In the center background, at the end of the corridor, a white spiral staircase is visible, partially submerged and ascending into the gloom. This staircase becomes a more central element in the background of the larger room. Four brighter, circular light sources are located beside the staircase, contributing to the eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The environment is pervaded by a faint, eerie green light, emphasizing the mysterious and liminal quality of the space, with the focus on the stark architectural forms and the incongruous flooding. The video features mild barrel distortion, adding to the unsettling atmosphere as the camera continues to move forward, capturing the transition from the narrow corridor to the larger room, where the staircase and lights become prominent features in the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned above water, looking straight ahead with a level angle. It employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The camera moves forward with unsteady, noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "This video, presented from a first-person point of view within a 3D game environment, begins in a dimly lit, narrow corridor with greenish-hued tiled walls, its lower half submerged in dark, rippling water. As the camera moves forward, the scene transitions into a larger room where the water continues to ripple, and a white spiral staircase is centrally positioned, also partially inundated, ascending into the gloom. The environment is pervaded by a faint, eerie green light, with four circular-shaped lights visible in the distance near the staircase, contributing to the unsettling atmosphere. The focus is on the mysterious and liminal quality of the environment itself, emphasizing the stark architectural forms and the incongruous flooding, rather than on a distinct subject.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a first-person perspective reminiscent of a 3D game, beginning in a narrow, dark, tiled hallway partially submerged in water. As the scene progresses, it transitions into a larger room, enhancing the immersive experience. At the end of the hallway, a white spiral staircase ascends, illuminated by a faint light source, contributing to the eerie and unsettling atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dimly lit, narrow indoor corridor. The walls are lined with light-colored, rectangular tiles that reflect a faint greenish hue from the ambient lighting. The corridor is flooded with dark, murky water that ripples gently. In the distance, at the end of the corridor, a white spiral staircase is partially submerged in the water. Four brighter, circular light sources are located beside the staircase. The video then transitions into a larger room, maintaining the overall dark and enclosed atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a scenery shot, presented as a wide shot. Initially, the frame is dominated by a narrow corridor. Tiled walls occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Dark, rippling water fills the bottom half of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. In the center background, at the end of the corridor, a white spiral staircase is visible, partially submerged. As the camera moves forward, the corridor walls recede, and the view transitions into a larger, water-filled room. In this new space, the staircase becomes a more central element in the background, and four circular lights become visible near the staircase. The camera is positioned at eye level, as if from a first-person perspective moving through the water."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
