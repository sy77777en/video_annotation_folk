  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle perspective, filmed from a first-person perspective with a fisheye lens, creating noticeable distortion where straight lines curve outward. The video begins with a large, green paneled wall in the middle ground, occupying the left and center of the frame, with a black door positioned in the center-right. The camera, held unsteadily at eye-level, uses a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera then pans slowly from left to right and moves forward, simulating a person walking through the doorway created by the black door and into the building. As the camera moves, the green wall shifts out of frame to the left. Once inside, the space reveals white walls and a digital display screen distinct from a yellow emergency call box. Opposite the wall with the emergency call box, a large, boxy kiosk with a glass window and a beige vented panel is positioned on the left side of the frame. The final composition shows a ticket booth in the left foreground, a white wall with a yellow emergency call box on the right, and two police officers standing in the center-left middle ground, contributing to the ambiance of a functional, public area. By the end of the video, the background consists of the opposite white wall, which features a grey door, wires, and pipes. The area is illuminated by overhead artificial lighting, and the floor is made of concrete, with lines creating the impression of distinct concrete rectangles.",

    "Camera": "The video is filmed from a first-person perspective with a fisheye lens, creating noticeable distortion where straight lines curve outward. The camera, held unsteadily at eye-level, uses a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The footage shows the camera moving forward into a subway station and turning to the right.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an indoor scenery shot of a public transit station corridor. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the space rather than a specific subject, with the wide, moving perspective capturing the setting's character. The view pans from behind a green paneled wall to reveal a narrow passageway containing a ticket booth with a large glass window. On the opposite white wall, a yellow emergency call box is mounted, and further down the corridor, two police officers in dark uniforms stand conversing, contributing to the ambiance of a functional, public area.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of an indoor location, likely a public transit station. The camera pans slowly from left to right, revealing a narrow corridor. Two police officers are seen standing and talking in the corridor.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a narrow passageway within a public transit station. The camera turns right to enter through the black door labeled \"D-2\" on a large green metal wall. Once inside, the space reveals white walls and a digital display screen distinct from a yellow emergency call box. Opposite the wall with the emergency call box, a large, boxy kiosk with a glass window and a beige vented panel is positioned on the left side of the frame. Further inside, two police officers in dark uniforms stand near the white wall. The area is illuminated by overhead artificial lighting, and the floor is made of concrete, with lines creating the impression of distinct concrete rectangles.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
