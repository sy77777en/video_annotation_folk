  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic nighttime urban street scene, with a wide shot capturing the full expanse of the street and surrounding buildings. Neon signs dominate the frame, their bright colors vividly reflecting on the wet pavement, suggesting recent rain. Vehicles and pedestrians move through the scene, with the camera positioned at a vehicle's dashboard height, offering a driver's perspective. The camera, mounted on a moving vehicle, progresses forward, creating a dynamic perspective as it captures the neon-lit urban street scene. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp, and maintains a fixed Dutch angle, resulting in a tilted horizon. As the camera moves forward, objects transition from the background to the middle ground and from the middle ground to the foreground, enhancing the sense of progression through the urban environment. The street is busy with parked cars and a few moving vehicles, and the reflections of the neon signs create a lively and dynamic atmosphere. The camera advances along the street, passing by brightly lit buildings and shops, including a sign that reads 'HOT LIPS' in red and green. More signs and buildings come into view, maintaining the same vibrant and bustling street scene. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling city environment illuminated by vibrant neon lights in various colors, predominantly cyan, reds, greens, and some yellow. These lights reflect off the wet pavement, contributing to the dynamic cityscape. The overall scene conveys a sense of motion as the vehicle moves through the illuminated urban landscape, emphasizing the continuous flow of the street and creating a vivid portrayal of the bustling cityscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
