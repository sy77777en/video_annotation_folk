  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a medium shot of a light-skinned man with short brown hair, wearing a black baseball cap backward and a bright blue t-shirt, sitting on an exercise bike in the center middle ground. His face and neck are covered in sweat. The camera, in a broadcast point-of-view shot with noticeable unsteadiness, starts with an eye-level, level-angle shot using deep focus to keep both the subjects and background sharp. The handheld camera initially focuses on the male interviewee, who is speaking into a microphone held by a light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a black blazer. She stands in front of him, gesturing with her left hand as she talks. The camera then pans right and moves backward to include the female reporter in the frame, transitioning to a wider shot. In the final composition, the man is positioned on the left side of the middle ground, with his full body visible on the exercise bike, while the woman, shown from the upper body up, stands in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, holding a microphone with a \"PAUL HENRY\" logo toward him. In the middle ground, another light-skinned man with short dark hair, dressed in an outfit resembling a competition staff uniform, is actively taking notes with a pen during the interview and then leaves. The background features rows of empty, blue stadium seats under artificial lighting, with several banners visible, including a white one for the \"Halberg Disability Sport Foundation,\" a blue one with \"Concept\" branding, and a yellow and white one for \"Dole.\" Multiple exercise bikes are positioned on the dark floor. On-screen graphics are present as overlay elements, with \"LIVE\" in the top right corner and a news banner along the bottom of the frame displaying \"VECTOR ARENA, AUCKLAND\" and \"NEWS HEADLINES\" next to a \"PAUL\" logo.",

    "Motion": "A man sits on a stationary exercise bike while speaking into a microphone held by a woman. The woman gestures with her left hand as she talks to him. The man then removes his hands from the handlebars. In the middle ground, another man is writing something nearby and then leaves.",
    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set indoors at the Vector Arena in Auckland. The background features rows of empty, blue stadium seats under artificial lighting. Several banners are visible, including a white one for the \"Halberg Disability Sport Foundation,\" a blue one with \"Concept\" branding, and a yellow and white one for \"Dole.\" Multiple exercise bikes are positioned on the dark floor. The broadcast includes several text overlays: \"LIVE\" appears in the top right corner, while a banner at the bottom of the screen displays \"VECTOR ARENA, AUCKLAND\" and \"NEWS HEADLINES\" next to a \"PAUL\" logo.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a medium shot of a man in the center middle ground. The camera then moves backward and pans right, transitioning to a wider shot. In the final composition, the man is positioned on the left side of the middle ground, with his full body visible on an exercise bike. A woman, shown from the upper body up, stands in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, holding a microphone. Another man is visible in the middle ground, standing between the two main subjects but further back. The background is occupied by rows of empty stadium seats, with several banners hanging in the upper background. On-screen graphics are present as overlay elements, with \"LIVE\" in the top right corner and a news banner along the bottom of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
