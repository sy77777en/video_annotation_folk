  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an indoor pool scene, with no major subjects present. Initially, the camera is positioned low, just above the water level inside an arched, tiled tunnel, which frames the shot from the top, right, and left foreground and middle ground. The green pool water occupies the bottom of the frame. Through the tunnel opening, a brightly lit pool area is visible in the center-left middle ground. The soft beige lighting casts a warm glow on the white square tiles lining the tunnel, contrasting with the green pool water. The camera, filmed from a level, above-water position, executes a quick and smooth pan to the right, revealing more of the tiled interior wall before settling on a view looking straight at another, similar tunnel opening in the center of the frame. The shot is characterized by mild barrel distortion and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The focus is on creating a tranquil atmosphere within this uniquely constructed pool interior.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
