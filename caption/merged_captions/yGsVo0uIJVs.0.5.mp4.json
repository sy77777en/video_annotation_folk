  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a control room, with the camera positioned at hip level and moving forward through a room filled with figures in uniform working at computer consoles. In the left foreground and middle ground, several men with a uniform, stylized, and mannequin-like appearance, all having pale skin and no distinct facial features, are positioned at large control consoles. They are dressed in matching teal-colored uniforms consisting of a long-sleeved jacket, trousers, and a peaked cap, with some wearing tall black boots. In the right middle ground, a group of men is seated at a desk, while another man stands behind them. The background is filled by a wall of server racks that spans the width of the frame, featuring glowing green screens. The room, which has a light gray floor and dark gray walls, is illuminated by several white, cylindrical fluorescent lights suspended from the ceiling. Throughout the shot, white text reading \"MARCH 8th, 1968\" is superimposed in the bottom-left corner. This dynamic shot of a computer-generated scene depicts a control room where several figures in teal uniforms are positioned throughout the room, some standing at consoles, others sitting at desks, and a few standing at attention. While the figures remain stationary, the camera smoothly advances forward, creating a dynamic perspective. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the foreground figures to the background server racks, in sharp detail. The scene is set within a large, stylized control room with a muted color palette, and the back wall is lined with rows of dark gray mainframe computer cabinets. The figures are engaged in various activities within a room containing large, vintage-style computer equipment, with several men standing at large, dark grey control consoles, while others are seated in office chairs at desks, interacting with early computer terminals.",

The back wall is lined with rows of dark gray mainframe computer cabinets featuring glowing green screens. In the center and foreground are large, dark gray control consoles. The room, which has a light gray floor and dark gray walls, is illuminated by several white, cylindrical fluorescent lights suspended from the ceiling. Figures dressed in teal uniforms and caps are positioned throughout the space; some stand at the consoles, while others are seated in office chairs at a desk on the right. An overlay of white text appears in the lower-left corner, reading, \"MARCH 8th, 1968.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
