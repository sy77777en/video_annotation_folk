  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a full shot of a person with long blonde hair tied back, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a bright yellow and blue wingsuit, positioned in the center-middle ground. They have a black backpack with blue and white stripes and yellow and black hiking boots. A large rock formation is to the left in the middle ground, with distant mountains in the right background under a sky filled with heavy grey clouds. The ground is covered in loose, light-colored stones, and patches of snow are near the base of the rock formation. The person walks a few steps forward across the rocky, mountainous landscape, away from the camera, causing the framing to shift to a wide shot. The static, hip-level shot uses a deep focus to keep both the person in the wingsuit and the rocky mountain landscape in sharp detail. The video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion as the person walks toward the cliff edge. They then stop in the center-middle ground and spread their arms out to the sides, fully extending the wings of the suit. A break in the clouds reveals other sharp mountain peaks in the distance to the right. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level, capturing the unfolding scene with clarity.",

    "Subject": "A person with long blonde hair tied back is shown from behind, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a bright yellow and blue wingsuit. They wear a black backpack with blue and white stripes and yellow and black hiking boots. The person walks a few steps forward on the rocky ground, then stops and spreads their arms wide, fully extending the wings of the suit.",
    "Motion": "A person in a yellow wingsuit walks forward across a rocky, mountainous landscape. They then stop and spread their arms out to the sides, fully extending the wings of the suit.",
    "Scene": "A person in a yellow wingsuit with a black backpack featuring blue and white stripes stands on a wide, rocky mountain plateau under a sky filled with heavy grey clouds. The ground is covered in loose, light-colored stones. To the left, a large, layered rock formation has patches of snow near its base. In the distance to the right, a break in the clouds reveals other sharp mountain peaks. The person walks a few steps away from the camera before stopping and spreading their arms, unfurling the fabric of the wingsuit.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
