  "merged_caption": "This video begins with an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot, filmed by a drone capturing an aerial view of a city river during the daytime. The camera, positioned at an aerial height, glides smoothly forward over a river, tilting up slightly and panning to the right, capturing a high-angle view with deep focus that keeps the entire cityscape and river sharp. A brown bascule bridge extends from the central left middle ground to the right middle ground, and as the camera moves forward, it shifts into the foreground. Several tan-colored military tanks are moving across the bridge from right to left. Initially, the river occupies the center of the frame, flowing under the bridge, but as the camera pans right, it shifts slightly to the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, a large, white double-decker tour boat is positioned on the left, moving towards the camera, while a smaller, faster speedboat travels slightly to its right, creating a white wake. The background features modern city buildings along the top of the frame and a riverbank on the right. The riverbanks are lined with a paved riverwalk and a small patch of green space. On the far bank, a large splash erupts from the water near an undeveloped dirt lot, in front of the riverbank with the buildings. The scene captures a light-colored stone tender house at both ends of the bridge, establishing a location and atmosphere of conflict. The focus is on the overall environment and scale rather than a specific subject, using the wide perspective to convey the scope of the event. The camera is not stationary; it moves forward, pans right, and tilts up, providing a dynamic, elevated view of the scene.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, establishing a location and atmosphere of conflict. The focus is on the overall environment and scale rather than a specific subject, using the wide perspective to convey the scope of the event. The scene captures a brown metal bascule bridge with several military tanks moving across its span. Below, a double-decker tour boat and a smaller speedboat move through the dark river water. The background features modern city buildings, a grassy riverbank, an empty dirt lot, and a large splash in the water caused by waves.",
    "Motion": "This is an aerial view of a city riverfront on a sunny day. A large drawbridge with several military tanks on it spans the water. In the background, modern buildings line the river, and a large splash is visible near the bank.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a city river during the daytime. The scene is centered on a brown steel bascule bridge, which spans the wide, dark water. The bridge features a light-colored stone tender house at both ends, and several tan-colored military tanks are moving across its roadway. In the river, a large, white double-decker tour boat and a smaller, faster speedboat creating a white wake are visible. The riverbanks are lined with modern city buildings, a paved riverwalk, and a small patch of green space. On the far bank, a large splash erupts from the water near an undeveloped dirt lot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
