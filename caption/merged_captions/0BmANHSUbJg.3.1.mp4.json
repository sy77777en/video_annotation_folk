  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage prominently on the right side of the frame and the wing extending towards the left. The camera is fixed to the airplane, moving forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion. Multiple explosions occur in the mid-ground, including on the left side of the frame, near the center-right at the nose of the aircraft, and on the burning wing. Bright orange flames and thick black smoke engulf the airplane's wing, rapidly spreading and forming a massive fireball. As the explosion intensifies, the warehouse structure collapses under the impact. Thick black smoke emerges from the mid-ground at both the wing and nose positions. The hangar spans the entire mid-ground and background, occupying the full width of the frame, contrasting against the dark night sky. The environment is illuminated by bright lights on the hangar, casting reflections on the wet tarmac. The scene transitions from the initial explosion to the aftermath, where smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the view of the collapsed hangar and the aircraft. Gradually, the intensity of the flames diminishes, leaving behind a significant amount of black smoke. The scene concludes with the airplane surrounded by less intense flames and more smoke, highlighting the aftermath of the explosion and the collapsed warehouse. The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction, with the flames' intense orange and yellow hues contrasting against the dark night sky. The deep focus and large depth of field capture the dramatic impact of the explosion and the subsequent destruction, with the wet tarmac reflecting the bright lights, adding depth to the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a level angle, utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a dramatic scene where a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows is in the foreground. The airplane crashes into a warehouse, triggering a fiery explosion. Bright orange flames and thick black smoke engulf the airplane's wing, rapidly spreading and forming a massive fireball. As the explosion intensifies, the warehouse structure collapses under the impact. Gradually, the intensity of the flames diminishes, leaving behind a significant amount of black smoke. The scene concludes with the airplane surrounded by less intense flames and more smoke, highlighting the aftermath of the explosion and the collapsed warehouse.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a dramatic scene at an airport during nighttime, with a locked-on POV shot fixed to an aircraft. The setting is outdoors, featuring a large airplane adjacent to a hangar. The environment is illuminated by bright lights on the hangar, casting reflections on the wet tarmac. A significant explosion occurs as the airplane crashes into the hangar, causing it to collapse. Flames and thick black smoke engulf the wing of the aircraft, with the fire's intense orange and yellow hues contrasting against the dark night sky. The scene transitions from the initial explosion to the aftermath, where smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the view of the collapsed hangar and the aircraft. The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium shot of a large passenger airplane, with its white fuselage prominently on the right side of the frame and the wing extending towards the left. Multiple explosions occur in the mid-ground, including on the left side of the frame, near the center-right at the nose of the aircraft, and on the burning wing. Thick black smoke emerges from the mid-ground at both the wing and nose positions. The hangar spans the entire mid-ground and background, occupying the full width of the frame, contrasting against the dark night sky. As the video progresses, the explosion intensifies, leading to the collapse of the hangar. The flames and smoke increase in volume, gradually obscuring more of the hangar and the aircraft. The camera is fixed to the airplane, moving forward with it, which emphasizes the dramatic impact of the explosion and the subsequent destruction. The wet tarmac reflects the bright lights, adding depth to the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
