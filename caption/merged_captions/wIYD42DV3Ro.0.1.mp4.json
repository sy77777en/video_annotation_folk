  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, where a large, multi-tiered grandstand filled with spectators dominates the background, occupying the top and left of the frame. In the middle ground, a group of horses and jockeys is clustered in the center, racing on a dirt track that fills the bottom half of the scene from the foreground to the middle ground. The jockeys wear colorful racing silks, including blue, white, and red, and guide their horses, which are of various shades of brown, around a bend. As the horses gallop from left to right, the camera slightly tilts down and then smoothly pans right to follow their movement, transitioning into a wide shot. The horses and jockeys become the central focus, moving across the middle of the frame. As the grandstand disappears from the left, spectators gathered outside the fence on the grass become visible, along with white buildings in the distant background. The dirt track remains in the bottom portion of the frame. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the sequence, with a deep focus and large depth of field. The scene is set in a large stadium with a distinctive spire-topped building, and the track is bordered by a white railing, separating the racing area from the grassy infield. The race takes place during the daytime under an overcast sky, with diffused daylight illuminating the scene. An additional building is located across from the stands, becoming visible only after the horses round a corner, suggesting a bustling event atmosphere. Overlay elements include a network logo in the top right corner, indicating the broadcast nature of the video. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, capturing the intensity and excitement of the race.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus and large depth of field. As the racing horses approach, the camera slightly tilts down and then smoothly pans right to track them, keeping the movement steady. The horses become larger in the frame during the tracking shot.",
    "Subject": "The video features a horse race on a dirt track with multiple horses and jockeys in motion. The jockeys wear colorful racing silks, including blue, white, and red, and are positioned on the horses, guiding them around a bend. The horses are of various shades of brown and are galloping closely together. The scene is set in a large stadium filled with spectators, visible in the background, with a multi-tiered grandstand and a distinctive spire-topped building. The track is bordered by a white railing, separating the racing area from the grassy infield. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, capturing the intensity and excitement of the race.",

    "Scene": "The video captures a horse racing event from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production. The setting is outdoors at a racetrack, which encircles a well-maintained grassy area. The race takes place during the daytime under an overcast sky, with diffused daylight illuminating the scene. The grandstand, centrally positioned, is a multi-tiered structure featuring two distinctive spires, adding architectural interest. It is filled with spectators on one side, while tents are situated on the grassy area. The racetrack is a dirt path, and the horses, ridden by jockeys in colorful attire, are in motion, kicking up dust as they race. An additional building is located across from the stands, becoming visible only after the horses round a corner, suggesting a bustling event atmosphere. Overlay elements include a network logo in the top right corner, indicating the broadcast nature of the video.",

As the horses gallop from left to right around a bend, the camera pans right to follow their movement, simultaneously transitioning into a wide shot. In this new composition, the horses and jockeys become the central focus, moving across the middle of the frame. As the grandstand disappears from the left, spectators gathered outside the fence on the grass become visible, along with white buildings in the distant background. The dirt track remains in the bottom portion of the frame. A network logo is a fixed overlay in the top right corner. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
