  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of dark green tree silhouettes that fill the entire frame. The camera smoothly moves upward and forward, rising above the forest to create a sense of upward motion. As the camera ascends, it reveals a stylized, bright red bird with large, outstretched wings emerging from the bottom-center foreground and flying upward to the center of the frame. The bird ascends from a vast forest of green, stylized trees covering rolling hills. As the camera continues to move forward to follow the bird, the shot transitions into a wide shot, showing a landscape of green, forested hills in the middle ground and a blue sky with clouds in the background. The red, bird-like creature with large wings continues to fly up and away from a high angle, moving from the center to the top center of the frame and shrinking as it recedes into the background. As the bird continues to ascend and fly away into the bright blue daytime sky, which is dotted with a few white, fluffy clouds, the camera moves forward to track the flying bird, revealing a wider view of rolling green hills and a winding orange-brown road in the valley below. The winding orange road appears behind the valley in the middle ground, which occupies the bottom half of the frame, while the sky fills the top half. The bird becomes progressively smaller as it flies further into the distance, continuing along the path of the winding road.",

    "Camera": "In this animated scene, the camera smoothly moves upward and forward, rising above the forest to create a sense of upward motion and reveal the landscape.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up on the dark green, silhouetted forms of pine trees. The view then pulls back to reveal a stylized, bright red bird with large, outstretched wings flying upwards. The bird emerges from a vast forest of green, stylized trees covering rolling hills. As the bird continues to fly away into a light blue sky with white clouds, a winding, orange-brown road becomes visible in the valley below.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves upward from a close-up of silhouetted pine trees to reveal a red bird flying upwards from a vast forest. As the bird continues to ascend and fly away into the sky, the camera moves forward to track the flying bird, revealing a wider view of rolling green hills and a winding orange road in the valley below. The bird becomes progressively smaller as it flies further into the distance.",
    "Scene": "In a 2D animated landscape, the scene begins with a close-up of dark green, stylized pine trees before the camera moves upward to reveal a vast, hilly terrain. The rolling green hills are covered in forests, and a single, winding orange-brown road runs through a valley. A red, bird-like creature with large wings ascends from the treetops, flying higher into the bright blue daytime sky, which is dotted with a few white, fluffy clouds, while also moving further away along the path of the winding road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
