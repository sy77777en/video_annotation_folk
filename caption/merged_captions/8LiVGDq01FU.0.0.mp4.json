  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man wearing a white space suit with a helmet that has a clear visor, showing his light skin tone and short hair. He is positioned slightly off-center, occupying the center-right portion of the frame, and is situated in the foreground. The background, featuring blurred vertical lines, is dimly lit and suggests a textured wall or structure, possibly made of wood or metal. The helmet is primarily white with grey and black sections, metallic silver trim around the neck ring, and visible scuff marks on its surface. The clear visor reflects some light sources. The man's head moves slightly within the frame as he speaks, and his expression becomes more animated, beginning to smile and showing his teeth, suggesting he is engaged in an intense or urgent situation. His mouth is open, and his eyes are wide, adding to the expressive nature of his face. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, featuring a low-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, adding a subtle dynamic to the scene. His overall position remains relatively constant, and the background remains dark and indistinct, suggesting an indoor or enclosed environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a low-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, adding a subtle dynamic to the scene.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man wearing a white space suit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible through the visor, showing a light skin tone and short hair. The man appears to be speaking or reacting with an expressive face, as his mouth is open and his eyes are wide. The suit has visible details such as straps and connectors, typical of astronaut gear. The man is oriented towards the camera, and his facial expression suggests he is engaged in an intense or urgent situation.",
    "Motion": "The man, dressed in a white space suit with a helmet, is seen in a close-up shot. He begins to smile, showing his teeth, and his expression becomes more animated. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an indoor or enclosed environment.",
    "Scene": "The video features a close-up view of a person wearing a spacesuit helmet indoors. The helmet is primarily white with grey and black sections, metallic silver trim around the neck ring, and visible scuff marks on its surface. The clear visor reflects some light sources. The background is dimly lit and blurred, showing vertical lines that suggest a textured wall or structure, possibly made of wood or metal.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man wearing a spacesuit helmet. He is positioned slightly off-center, occupying the center-right portion of the frame, and is situated in the foreground. The background, featuring blurred vertical lines, is dimly lit and occupies the background space.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
