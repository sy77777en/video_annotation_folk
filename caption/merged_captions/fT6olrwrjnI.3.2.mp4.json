  "merged_caption": "A young man with medium, dark hair and bangs, wearing a red, sleeveless athletic jersey with black trim and a black number \"1\" on the chest, layered over a long-sleeved black compression shirt, red shorts over black leggings, and black athletic shoes, is positioned in the center of the frame on a bright green soccer pitch marked with a white line. His noticeable cyan-colored eyes and a faint, glowing blue aura surrounding his body add to his striking appearance. A classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball is near his right foot at the bottom center. The green soccer pitch is visible at the bottom, while a luminous, featureless white background fills the top portion of the frame. The camera is at the subject's height and quickly dollies forward toward the soccer player. As it moves, it subtly pans right and moves up to focus on the player's face during their shot. The young man draws his right leg back in preparation to kick the soccer ball, then proceeds to kick it while rotating his torso. The animated setting enhances the dynamic pose of the male figure, dressed in a red and black uniform featuring the number one, as he is surrounded by a glowing blue aura on the field.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
