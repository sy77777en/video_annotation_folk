  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a city street in Kabukicho, Tokyo, during the early evening or possibly early morning. The video begins with a low-angle view, looking up at an overhead street sign reading 'Kabukicho Sakura-dori St.' that occupies the top center middle ground, surrounded by tall buildings with various signs and advertisements. The architecture includes modern structures with glass facades and brick exteriors. Brightly lit signs with Japanese characters adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The camera, at eye level, employs deep focus with a large depth of field, tilts downward, revealing more of the street below, including a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and some construction cones placed on the road. As the camera continues to move forward slightly, more details of the street become visible, such as additional signs, storefronts, and more pedestrians. The perspective shifts to a level-angle view looking down the street. In the final composition, the street fills the lower portion of the frame, with orange traffic cones extending from the left foreground to the left middle ground. The buildings on the left and right recede into the background, and a person walks from the right foreground toward the right of the frame and disappears from the frame. The street is of normal width but becomes narrower where orange traffic cones block a portion of the sidewalk, guiding pedestrian flow. The sky is clear, transitioning from day to night, casting a soft blue hue. The environment is lively, with people walking along the street, and the atmosphere is typical of a busy city district, emphasizing the vibrant atmosphere created by numerous colorful signs and advertisements on the buildings, reflecting a bustling city life.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
