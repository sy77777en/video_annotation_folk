  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures Air Force One, a Boeing 747 with a distinctive design, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The aircraft, painted in the livery of Air Force One, features a white top half and a light blue bottom half, with a darker blue stripe running along the middle. The nose is painted in the darker blue color, and \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" is printed along its side, with an American flag on the tail and the presidential seal near the nose. The plane's landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground, and small red lights are visible on the aircraft's body and wingtips. The camera, maintaining a level-angle shot with deep focus, moves slightly unsteadily towards the aircraft, creating an unstable perspective. The camera moves forward and slightly downward to approach the plane, keeping the entire aircraft and its surroundings sharp. The aircraft rests on a dark gray ground plane that extends from the foreground to the middle ground, while the background is entirely black, creating a stark, isolated setting. The scene is evenly lit, highlighting the plane against the dark surroundings. The video captures Air Force One appearing stationary on the ground, with the camera moving slightly closer in an unsteady manner. The aircraft has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The cockpit windows are visible, and there is a red light located at the bottom of the fuselage. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, emphasizing the sleek, streamlined shape of the plane against the consistently dark background.",

    "Scene": "A Boeing 747, painted in the livery of Air Force One, is stationary on a dark gray, featureless ground plane. The background is completely black, creating a stark, isolated setting. The aircraft's fuselage is white on top and light blue on the bottom, with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" printed along its side, an American flag on the tail, and the presidential seal near the nose. The plane's landing gear is deployed, and small red lights are visible on the aircraft's body and wingtips. The scene is evenly lit, highlighting the plane against the dark surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
