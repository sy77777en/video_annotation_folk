  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle, elevated viewpoint looking across a vast canyon. Craggy, reddish-brown peaks occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while the expansive canyon's layered formations fill the middle ground and background. The top half of the frame is dominated by a sky of dark and light clouds. Initially, a concentrated shaft of rain falls from the clouds into the center of the frame, descending into the middle ground of the canyon. As the time-lapse progresses, this curtain of rain shifts its position from the center towards the right side of the frame. In the middle ground to background on the far right, a river can be seen winding through the canyon floor. This is a dramatic, wide-angle time-lapse of a storm cell moving over the Grand Canyon. The shot captures the movement of heavy clouds and a concentrated shaft of rain falling into the vast canyon. The camera smoothly pans from left to right. The video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm moving across a vast canyon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric intensity of the weather. Heavy, turbulent clouds, a mix of dark grey and bright white, dominate the sky, and a dense, localized downpour descends into the heart of the canyon, creating a semi-transparent curtain of falling water. The canyon itself is a sprawling vista of layered red and brown rock formations, with sharp, craggy peaks in the foreground and a winding river visible in the distant valley. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp, as it performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right.",

    "Scene": "From an elevated viewpoint, a time-lapse captures a dramatic weather event over the Grand Canyon. The vast landscape is characterized by layered, reddish-brown rock formations that stretch into the distance. A heavy, overcast sky is filled with dark grey and white clouds, from which a concentrated shaft of rain initially falls into the center of the canyon and then shifts towards the right. In the far right, a river winds its way through the base of the canyon floor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
