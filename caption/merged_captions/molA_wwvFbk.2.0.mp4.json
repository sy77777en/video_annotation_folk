  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a collapsing cityscape, captured from a fixed, low angle looking up. Initially, a large section of a multi-story building's ornate facade, characterized by arched windows and positioned in the top-left and center of the frame, tilts downwards and towards the right. As this middle-ground structure crumbles, it reveals the building's exposed interior across the center of the frame, with separate floors and rooms becoming visible. Debris and dust explode outwards, filling the foreground and middle ground in a dynamic motion. Amidst this chaotic spectacle, a small, dark-clad figure is briefly visible in the center of the frame, walking horizontally from left to right along an exposed floor in the middle ground, introducing a poignant human element that emphasizes the immense scale of the architectural destruction. The camera employs a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and capturing the dramatic motion of the building's collapse. The monochromatic, black-and-white composition enhances the catastrophic atmosphere, as the structure's detailed facade and internal framework are laid bare. The video captures the overwhelming environmental chaos, highlighting both the dramatic spectacle of the destruction and the solitary figure within it.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a fixed, low angle, the camera captures the collapsing building with a unique perspective. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This black-and-white cityscape destruction scene captures the catastrophic collapse of ornate, multi-story buildings, with entire facades tilting and breaking apart, sending clouds of dust and rubble cascading downwards in a chaotic spectacle. Amidst the overwhelming event, a small, dark-clad figure briefly appears walking across a partially destroyed floor, introducing a poignant human element that emphasizes the immense scale of the architectural destruction. The camera focuses on the environmental chaos, highlighting both the dramatic spectacle and the solitary figure within it.",
    "Motion": "This is a black-and-white, low-angle shot of a multi-story building with ornate, arched windows. The building is shown in a state of catastrophic collapse. Its facade crumbles away, revealing the interior structure and a small figure inside, as debris and dust explode outwards. The video captures the dynamic motion of the building's destruction.",
    "Scene": "In a monochromatic scene, an ornate, multi-story building undergoes a catastrophic collapse. The structure, characterized by its detailed facade and arched windows, tilts and breaks apart, creating a large cloud of dust and debris. As the exterior walls crumble away, the building's internal framework is exposed, revealing its separate floors and rooms. A small figure is briefly visible walking on a narrow ledge within the disintegrating structure.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
