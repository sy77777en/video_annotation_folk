  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, static, time-lapse video of a snowy landscape at night, shot from a low angle, eye-level perspective. The snow extends from the foreground to the middle ground, covering only one-fifth of the frame. In the middle ground, a small, white, box-like building is situated in the bottom right, with a satellite dish to its left and various antennas on its roof. A line of dark evergreen trees extends across the middle ground behind the building. The background is dominated by the dark, star-filled sky, which takes up the majority of the upper portion of the frame. Throughout the shot, vibrant green ribbons of the aurora borealis dynamically shift and move across the background sky. Initially, they appear as faint bands, but then a bright green ribbon emerges from the top left and stretches downwards towards the middle-lower part of the scene, while other formations of the aurora appear and fade across the entire expanse of the sky. Midway through the video, an intense burst of light suddenly illuminates the building's facade, resulting in a brief, bright flash on one side. The camera remains completely still, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the snowy foreground to the starry sky, sharp and clear. The composition emphasizes the vast, atmospheric beauty of the arctic night, focusing on the interplay between the natural wonder of the aurora and the isolated human structure, creating a sense of scale and wonder.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video of the aurora borealis, shot from a low angle, eye-level perspective. The camera remains completely still, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the snowy foreground to the starry sky, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a breathtaking landscape of a remote, snow-covered location under a starry night sky. Vibrant green ribbons of the aurora borealis dance and shift across the deep blue expanse, forming ethereal curtains of light. In the foreground, a thick blanket of snow covers the ground, leading up to a line of dark evergreen trees. Positioned in the bottom right corner is a small, white, box-like building with a satellite dish to its left and antennas on its roof. The composition emphasizes the vast, atmospheric beauty of the arctic night, focusing on the interplay between the natural wonder of the aurora and the isolated human structure, creating a sense of scale and wonder.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a scenic view of the northern lights (aurora borealis) illuminating the night sky above a snowy landscape with a small building and trees. The green lights create a striking contrast against the dark, starry sky. The scene is tranquil and atmospheric.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video captures the aurora borealis dancing across a star-filled night sky in a remote, snowy landscape. In the middle ground, a small, white, box-like building with a satellite dish on its left side and various antennas on its roof sits amidst deep snow. A line of dark evergreen trees forms the horizon behind the structure. Midway through the video, an intense burst of light suddenly illuminates the building's facade, resulting in a brief, bright flash on one side. Throughout the sequence, vibrant green ribbons of light from the aurora shift, brighten, and move across the dark blue expanse of the sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
