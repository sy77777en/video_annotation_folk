  "merged_caption": "This video starts with a close-up shot of several items on a corkboard. At the beginning, a blue sticky note labeled \"BUTCHER\" is positioned in the left-center, with a silver, rectangular game piece for \"PARK PLACE\" to its right in the right-center. A red string extends from a red, round-headed pushpin on the \"BUTCHER\" note down toward the bottom of the frame. The camera moves along the corkboard, following the red string attached to the pushpin, while all the items on the board remain stationary. As it moves, the initial items shift toward the top of the frame and out of view, revealing a second blue sticky note labeled \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" that becomes the new central subject, held by another red pushpin. A portion of a yellow sticky note with \"$2k for $10k\" written on it enters from the bottom left and shifts from the bottom left to the top left throughout the shot. The camera rolls counterclockwise to adjust its orientation, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all the notes and the board's texture sharp. The camera's height is not discernible due to the lack of background information.",

    "Camera": "Due to the close-up nature of the shot, the camera's angle is unclear as it smoothly moves over a corkboard, shifting its focus from a sticker labeled \"BUTCHER\" to one reading \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND.\" As it moves, the camera rolls counterclockwise to adjust its orientation. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all the notes and the board's texture sharp. The camera's height is not discernible due to the lack of background information.",
    "Subject": "A close-up shot reveals several items pinned to a brown corkboard. The initial focus is on a light blue, square sticky note with the word \"BUTCHER\" handwritten in black capital letters. Next to it is a tilted, rectangular, silver game piece for \"PARK PLACE,\" which has a code \"676XDHQ1P6\" printed on it. A red string is attached to a red, round-headed pushpin that holds the square sticky note. The view then follows the red string and pushpin down to another light blue sticky note. This second note, now in focus, has the words \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" handwritten on it in black capital letters. A portion of a yellow sticky note with \"$2k for $10k\" written on it is also visible on the left side of the frame.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves along a corkboard, following a red string attached to a pushpin, while all the items on the board remain stationary. The focus shifts from an upper sticky note and a silver game piece to a lower sticky note that comes into clear view.",
    "Scene": "A close-up shot focuses on a corkboard with several items pinned to it. In the center of the frame, a light blue sticky note with the word \"BUTCHER\" in black marker is visible next to a silver, rectangular game piece for \"PARK PLACE.\" Both items disappear from the top of the frame as the camera moves down. The sticky note is pinned by a red thumbtack, which is connected to a red string. The camera moves down to reveal another light blue sticky note with \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" written on it, pinned by another red thumbtack. A corner of a yellow note with \"$10k\" is partially visible to the left of the two sticky notes.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
