  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a landscape, emphasizing the scenery over any specific subject. The composition is horizontally divided, with a vast, turbulent sky occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame and a green field filling the bottom third. A massive, dark storm cloud dominates the center and upper part of the frame, stretching across its width. In the background, at the center of the horizon, a curtain of rain falls, illuminated by a patch of golden light. A few small buildings are visible in the distant background, slightly to the left of the center. The storm system exhibits dynamic movement: the upper clouds appear to be moving toward the distant background, while the clouds and central rain shaft in the background seem to be moving toward the camera. The camera is slowly panning to the right, maintaining a low height as it looks across the foreground field toward the horizon. This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle, capturing an extreme wide view of a field and the sky. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The heavy, dark clouds move across the sky as rain falls in the distance. The wind blows through the green field, causing the grass to sway. The sky is dominated by a massive, dark grey storm cloud that looms over the entire scene, with a concentrated downpour visible as a rain shaft in the distance, illuminated by a contrasting pocket of golden light. Below, a vibrant green field of wind-swept grass stretches to the horizon, where a few tiny buildings are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation. The camera pans slowly and smoothly from left to right.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle, capturing an extreme wide view of a field and the sky. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The camera pans slowly and smoothly from left to right.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system moving across a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by a massive, dark grey storm cloud that looms over the entire scene, with a concentrated downpour visible as a rain shaft in the distance, illuminated by a contrasting pocket of golden light. Below, a vibrant green field of wind-swept grass stretches to the horizon, where a few tiny buildings are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, emphasizing the atmospheric tension and the sheer scale of the natural spectacle rather than any single object or figure.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a dramatic storm. The heavy, dark clouds move across the sky as rain falls in the distance. The wind blows through the green field, causing the grass to sway.",
    "Scene": "An expansive, flat green field stretches to the horizon under a turbulent sky. Massive, dark gray storm clouds fill the view, with a curtain of heavy rain falling in the distance. A sliver of the horizon beneath the storm is illuminated by a warm, golden light. The green grass or crops in the foreground sway and ripple in a strong wind as the storm system moves across the landscape. A few small buildings are faintly visible in the far distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
