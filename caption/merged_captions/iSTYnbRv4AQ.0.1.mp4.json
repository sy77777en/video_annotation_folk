  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the dynamic movement through an urban environment. The video presents a wide shot looking down a European city street at dusk, framed by multi-story, classical-style stone buildings on the left and right that recede into the background. The street occupies the bottom and center of the frame, with parked bicycles in the foreground and indistinct pedestrians scattered across the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a level angle and roughly eye level, moves forward rapidly in a time-lapse, creating intense radial motion blur on the periphery while the center remains more focused. As the camera advances, the flanking buildings and pedestrians sweep from the middle ground past the camera, and the perspective slightly pans to the left, bringing the buildings on the right side closer to the center. The wet pavement reflects the pale light of the twilight sky, enhancing the dynamic energy of the scene. The video is characterized by a strong motion blur effect, particularly at the edges of the frame, as the camera dollies forward quickly through the busy city street. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, including the surrounding buildings and pedestrians, in sharp detail. The blurred figures of pedestrians and scooters create a sense of bustling activity against the backdrop of a fading sky. The forward movement creates a dynamic effect, with the periphery of the view heavily blurred while the center remains more defined. The scene captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment, emphasizing the classic architecture and the vibrant energy of the city street at dusk.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a smooth, eye-level perspective. The camera dollies forward quickly through a busy city street, making a slight pan to the left midway through the shot. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, including the surrounding buildings and pedestrians, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot that captures the dynamic energy of a European city street at dusk. There is no main subject because the rapid, forward-moving perspective and significant motion blur render individual people and vehicles indistinct, instead emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment. The scene is characterized by classic, multi-story stone buildings lining a wet street, with blurred figures of pedestrians and scooters creating a sense of bustling activity against the backdrop of a fading sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse shot through a European city street at dusk. The video is characterized by a strong motion blur effect, particularly at the edges of the frame, as the camera moves swiftly forward. The scene features classic architecture, pedestrians, and scooters along the wet-looking pavement.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse perspective travels down a wide European city street at dusk. The wet pavement reflects the pale light of the twilight sky. On either side of the street stand multi-story, classical-style stone buildings. Numerous pedestrians, appearing as blurred shapes due to the time-lapse effect, are visible walking along the street and sidewalks, where some scooters are parked. The forward movement creates a dynamic effect, with the periphery of the view heavily blurred while the center remains more defined.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
