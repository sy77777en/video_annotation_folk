  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet residential street in Japan during the daytime. Initially, the frame shows the street extending from the bottom to the top left, with multi-story houses on both sides, featuring beige and grey siding. The houses are positioned in the middle ground, with the street itself in the foreground, extending into the middle ground and then the background. A silver Subaru station wagon is parked on the right side, in the middle ground, while a black car is visible further down the street on the left, also in the middle ground. Utility poles and overhead lines are positioned in the background, running parallel to the street. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward, pans left, and continues moving forward to reveal a wider view of the street. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the left, revealing more of the street and the ascending slope. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the street and houses maintaining their positions relative to the frame. The video begins with a view of a street corner, showing a silver car parked in front of a house with a blue and beige exterior. As the camera continues to move, a black car parked on the left side of the street comes into view, along with a small shop or building with a white sign and some plants outside. The presence of utility poles, street signs, and greenery adds to the sense of everyday life in a suburban setting, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the neighborhood. The sky appears clear with some light clouds.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet residential street lined with modern houses and parked cars. The focus is on the environment, showcasing the architecture, street layout, and urban atmosphere rather than any specific object. The presence of utility poles, street signs, and greenery adds to the sense of everyday life in a suburban setting, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the neighborhood.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a street corner, showing a silver car parked in front of a house with a blue and beige exterior. The camera slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the street and additional houses. As the camera continues to move, a black car parked on the left side of the street comes into view, along with a small shop or building with a white sign and some plants outside. The street is lined with utility poles and wires, and the background shows more houses and buildings in the distance.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a quiet, narrow residential street in Japan during the daytime. The video pans slightly left, revealing more of the paved road ascending a gentle slope. Multi-story houses with balconies line both sides of the street, featuring beige and grey siding. Overhead utility lines crisscross above the road. On the right, a silver Subaru station wagon is parked in a paved driveway next to a house with some green shrubbery and a small white sign bearing Japanese characters. Further down the street on the left, a black car is parked, and a scooter is partially visible in the immediate foreground. The sky appears clear with some light clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
