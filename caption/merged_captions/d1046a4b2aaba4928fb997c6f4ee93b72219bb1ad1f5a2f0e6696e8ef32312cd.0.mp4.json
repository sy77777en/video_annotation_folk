  "merged_caption": "This time-lapse video captures a bustling city street at night in London's Piccadilly Circus, with a static, wide, level-angle shot from an overhead, second-floor level. A large, dense crowd of people is gathered in the midground, slightly to the right of the frame, surrounding a tall, slender pillar. The crowd, composed of numerous men and women in casual, cool-weather clothing, forms several layers of onlookers, with most people remaining still as if watching something, while some shift their bodies, turn their heads, or slowly move through the crowd. Notable individuals include a person in a bright blue hoodie and another in a white hooded sweatshirt. In the foreground, a few people walk by or move around, while in the background, pedestrians hurry along the sidewalks on both sides of the street, captured in time-lapse, and vehicles travel along the road. An ornate, illuminated building occupies the upper-left and center-left portions of the frame, while another building lines the upper-right. A street recedes between the buildings from the center of the frame into the background, where the iconic red and blue circular sign for the London Underground is visible in the center-middle ground. The entire scene, from the dense crowd in the foreground to the distant buildings, remains consistently sharp due to the deep focus. The crowd is densely packed, creating a mass of figures under the bright glow of architectural lighting and commercial signs, with a slow, subtle movement rippling through the crowd. Many people in the crowd are holding up their smartphones, with the screens illuminated, as if they are recording or taking pictures of an event in front of them.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video captures a bustling city street as time passes rapidly. The camera is completely static, positioned at an overhead, second-floor level with a level angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the dense crowd in the foreground to the distant buildings, consistently sharp.",
    "Subject": "A large, dense crowd of people is gathered in an urban setting at night. The crowd is composed of numerous men and women, mostly seen from behind, wearing a variety of casual, cool-weather clothing. Notable individuals include a person in a bright blue hoodie, another in a white hooded sweatshirt, and several others in dark jackets and hoodies. Many people in the crowd are holding up their smartphones, with the screens illuminated, as if they are recording or taking pictures of an event in front of them. The individuals are standing close together, filling the foreground and midground of the scene.",
    "Motion": "In a bustling city square at night, a large, dense crowd gathers. In the midground, slightly to the right, people cluster around a tall, slender pillar, forming several layers of onlookers. While most remain stationary, as if observing something, some individuals shift their bodies, turn their heads, or slowly move through the crowd. In the foreground, a few people walk by or move around. In the background, pedestrians hurry along the sidewalks on both sides of the street, captured in time-lapse, while vehicles travel along the road.",
    "Scene": "A large crowd fills a street at night in London's Piccadilly Circus. Ornate, multi-story stone buildings with classical facades line both sides of the street, illuminated by warm, golden light against the dark sky. On the left, a sign for the Piccadilly Theatre is visible. Further down the street, the iconic red and blue circular sign for the London Underground stands out among other glowing advertisements. The street is densely packed with people, creating a mass of figures under the bright glow of architectural lighting and commercial signs, with a slow, subtle movement rippling through the crowd.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
