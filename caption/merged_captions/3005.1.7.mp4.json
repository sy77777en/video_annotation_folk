  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a young man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair, initially positioned slightly to the right of the center in the foreground, with his face occupying a significant portion of the frame. He is wearing a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders and is looking slightly up and to his right. As he takes a step back, he moves towards the center of the frame. Behind him, another young man, also of East Asian descent with short, dark hair and wearing a similar jacket, is positioned slightly to the left in the frame, although he is physically to the right of the main young man, and he is looking forward. In the background, to the far left, the face of a third young man with short, dark hair and a darker complexion briefly appears in profile as he passes by, also wearing a similar dark top. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the scene, maintaining a consistent focus on the prominent man in the foreground while it slowly dollies forward. The background features a dark navy blue wall adorned with large, stylized graphics of athletes in motion, including a silhouette holding a jump rope, outlined in red and white, which remain blurred due to the shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground subject. The scene is lit to highlight the man in the foreground, with the background elements appearing blurred due to the shallow depth of field. The spatial composition remains stable, with no significant changes in the positioning or framing of the subjects, aside from the main young man's slight movement.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the man in the foreground while it slowly dollies forward.",
    "Subject": "A young man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair is shown in a close-up, looking slightly up and to his right. He is wearing a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders. Behind him and to his left, another young man, also of East Asian descent with short, dark hair and wearing a similar jacket, is partially visible and looking forward. Further in the background and to the far left, a third young man with short, dark hair and a darker complexion is seen in profile, also wearing a similar dark top. Due to the shallow depth of field, the faces of the other individuals appear in soft focus and are only briefly visible due to their positions and the camera framing.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly dollies in on a group of three young men who appear to be taking a step backward.",
    "Scene": "Indoors, a group of young men walk in a loose formation, one behind the other. The man in the foreground stands out in a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders, while the others wear similar attire. They move past a dark, navy blue wall adorned with large, stylized graphics of athletes in motion, including a silhouette holding a jump rope, outlined in red and white. The scene is lit to highlight the man in the foreground, with the background elements appearing blurred due to the shallow depth of field.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
