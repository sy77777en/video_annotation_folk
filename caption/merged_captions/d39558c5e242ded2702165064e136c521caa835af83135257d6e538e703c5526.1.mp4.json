  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young boy of East Asian descent, wearing clear safety goggles and a white disposable glove on his right hand, is positioned in the center middle ground, holding a dropper and a small bottle of pink liquid. He carefully draws the liquid into the dropper and prepares to add it to a volumetric flask containing the pink liquid in the right middle ground. In the foreground, a large round-bottom flask containing orange liquid is on the left. To his left, a young girl with blonde hair, dressed in a plaid shirt, is partially visible in the middle ground on the right, looking down as she writes in an open notebook. The background features a black chalkboard in the center-left, flanked by potted plants, including a large leafy one and a tall cactus-like plant, on the left and right. A scientific diagram of a human torso and yellow sticky notes adorn the white wall. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground as he conducts his experiment. It performs a slightly unsteady backward dolly while panning to the right, gradually revealing more of the lab setting, including a beaker with reddish-brown liquid in the far-left foreground. The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor space resembling a science classroom or laboratory during the day. As the camera slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right, it reveals more of the girl and the arrangement of scientific glassware on the white table in the foreground, featuring three flasks: a large, round-bottom glass flask filled with a bright orange liquid, another glass flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, and a third flask at the far left edge with a reddish-brown liquid.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level, level angle, the camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground as he conducts his experiment. The camera performs a slightly unsteady backward dolly while panning to the right, gradually revealing more of the lab setting.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a young boy of East Asian descent, wearing clear safety goggles over his eyes and a white, short-sleeved button-up shirt with faint writing on it. He stands at a white table, wearing a white disposable glove on his right hand, as he carefully uses a dropper to draw a pink liquid from a small bottle he holds in his left hand. To his left, a young girl with blonde hair, dressed in a plaid shirt, sits and writes in an open notebook. On the table in front of them are three large glass flasks; the one on the far left contains a reddish-brown liquid, the middle one contains a bright orange liquid, and the one on the right contains a bright pink liquid.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor space resembling a science classroom or laboratory during the day. In the background, a black chalkboard and a white wall are adorned with yellow sticky notes and a scientific diagram of a human torso. Potted plants, including a large leafy one and a tall cactus-like plant, are positioned on either side. A white table in the foreground is arranged with scientific glassware, featuring three flasks: a large, round-bottom glass flask filled with a bright orange liquid, another glass flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, and a third flask at the far left edge with a reddish-brown liquid. A young person in a white shirt and safety goggles stands behind the table, handling a dropper with pink liquid, while another child is partially visible to the right, writing in a notebook.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
