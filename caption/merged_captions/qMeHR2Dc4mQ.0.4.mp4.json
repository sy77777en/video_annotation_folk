  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames an elderly, light-skinned man's face, which is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. He has graying, somewhat disheveled hair and deep wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes. His brows are furrowed, and his mouth is set in a firm, slightly downturned line. He is wearing a dark, possibly green, collared shirt. The background consists of a dimly lit, out-of-focus wall in a warm, neutral tone. Soft, directional lighting illuminates the space, casting pronounced shadows across his features. The camera maintains an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the man's face in sharp focus while the background remains heavily blurred. The scene is set within a dimly lit interior, characterized by a plain, out-of-focus wall. The camera moves slightly backward while remaining at the man's eye level, maintaining a consistent framing on his face as he looks slightly to the left of the camera. The man blinks slowly and his mouth moves slightly, while his head remains still and his gaze is fixed. This is a smooth, slow, eye-level shot that moves backward from a close-up of an elderly man. He looks slightly to his right with a fixed, intense expression.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
