  "merged_caption": "The shot begins with an upside-down high-angle view, centering on a teal sedan with a sunroof, surrounded by a group of men on cracked gray pavement in an urban outdoor location. The camera, featuring a speed ramp effect with shifts between fast and slow motion, cranes up to an overhead, bird's-eye angle, revealing the group of men mostly dressed in dark clothing, including black hoodies, jackets, and pants, some wearing baseball caps. A man with braided hair stands on the left side of the car, wearing a grey graphic t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and black and white sneakers, gesturing toward the camera with both hands. Another man with braided hair sits on the car's hood, dressed in a black hoodie with a blue and white graphic on the chest, black pants, and yellow and black sneakers, wearing a long chain necklace. The camera then cranes down, transitioning from a wide shot into a full shot of the singer, settling at a hip-level, level angle in front of the group. In the final composition, the man sitting on the car's hood is in the center-left middle ground, while the man standing is in the right middle ground. The car occupies the middle ground, with the rest of the group positioned around it to the left and right, in front of a chain-link fence. As the camera moves, the group of men shift their positions, with the man in the grey t-shirt gesturing and the man on the hood looking forward, while the others make minor adjustments to their stances. The lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting it is daytime, and the entire sequence is filmed with deep focus and very smooth camera movement.",

    "Camera": "This video features a speed ramp effect, with the playback speed shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera begins at an inverted, eye-level angle and smoothly cranes up to an overhead, bird's-eye view of a group of men around a car. It then cranes back down, settling at a hip-level, level angle in front of the group. The entire sequence is filmed with a deep focus and very smooth camera movement.",
    "Subject": "A group of men are gathered around a teal sedan that has a sunroof and its passenger-side doors open. On the left side of the car, a man with braided hair stands, wearing a grey graphic t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and black and white sneakers; he gestures toward the camera with both hands. To his right, another man with braided hair sits on the car's hood, dressed in a black hoodie with a blue and white graphic on the chest, black pants, and yellow and black sneakers. He wears a long chain necklace. The surrounding group of men are mostly dressed in dark clothing, including black hoodies, jackets, and pants. Some wear baseball caps, and one man on the far right is in a black jacket with a red lining, while another wears a black jacket with white designs on the sleeves. The men are positioned around the vehicle, facing in various directions.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in an urban outdoor location on cracked gray pavement. A teal sedan with a sunroof is parked in the center of the shot, surrounded by a group of men in dark clothing. The perspective initially begins at an inverted, eye-level angle and then smoothly transitions to an overhead view, looking directly onto the car and the people. The camera then cranes back down and settles at a hip-level perspective, focusing on two men positioned at the front of the vehicle, revealing a chain-link fence in the background. The lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting it is daytime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
