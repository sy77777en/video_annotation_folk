  "merged_caption": "A young man in white is positioned in the center, with another person in a red jersey on the right. A whiteboard is partially visible on the left. The young man with fair skin, messy black hair, and wide blue eyes is shown from the chest up, wearing a white sleeveless sweatshirt with blue stripes over a long-sleeved black undershirt, with a white insignia on his left bicep. He is looking directly at the camera with his mouth open. The scene features a brightly lit setting, with a whiteboard displaying the black text \"TEAM WHITE\" and \"TEAM RED\" on the left. The camera captures a medium close-up shot of the young man, appearing to be in the middle of a sports game. The camera is quite unsteady, with motion that lacks a clear pattern. The young man shakes his body rapidly throughout the video, transitioning his expression from gritting his teeth to opening his mouth wide. Partially visible behind him is the back of another person wearing a red jersey with the number \"50\" in black.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
