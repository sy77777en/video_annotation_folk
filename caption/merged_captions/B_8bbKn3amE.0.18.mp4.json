  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where the camera moves rapidly forward from an aerial perspective, flying through a deep crevasse in a glacier. Initially, large, fractured ice formations occupy the foreground on the left and right, framing the central chasm. In the middle ground, the upper part of the glacier extends towards the top left of the frame, revealing more of its textured, icy surface in both the middle ground and foreground. A dark, rocky mountain remains visible in the middle ground and background on the right under a cloudy sky. As the camera plunges into the crevasse, the towering ice walls fill the left and right sides of the frame, while the path ahead remains in the center. The shot continues its forward motion, showcasing more of the glacier's intricate surface, with the mountain still visible on the right. From an aerial high angle, the camera flies rapidly forward through a glacial crevasse. As it moves, it rolls slightly clockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire icy landscape in sharp detail. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point. The drone moves swiftly along the narrow channel, offering a wide perspective of the immense ice formations.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial high angle, the camera flies rapidly forward through a glacial crevasse. As it moves, it rolls slightly clockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire icy landscape in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial scenery shot that plunges the viewer through the dramatic landscape of a massive glacier. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is entirely on conveying the immense scale, raw texture, and imposing atmosphere of the glacial environment. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point.",
    "Motion": "This video offers a dramatic, wide aerial perspective of a massive glacier. The shot highlights the deep, icy crevasses and jagged formations of the glacier, which sits adjacent to a dark, rocky mountain under a cloudy sky. The camera moves swiftly through this immense and rugged landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight through a deep crevasse in a vast glacier. The towering walls of the crevasse are composed of white snow and dense, light-blue ice with a rough, fractured texture. To the side, a steep, dark brown and black rocky mountain face contrasts with the bright ice. The sky above is uniformly gray and overcast. The drone moves swiftly along the narrow channel, offering a wide perspective of the immense ice formations.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
