  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a green-gray, retro-style computer monitor prominently positioned in the foreground, set within a weathered, greenish-gray industrial frame in a dark environment. This is a static, high-angle shot looking down at the monitor, with the camera using a deep focus to keep the entire screen and its distorted images sharp and clear. The screen initially displays a glitchy, digital schematic of a sprawling underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" located at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters. Text and a logo for \"PATHOS-II\" are positioned in the top-left corner of the screen, with a large, ram-like skull mounted on a floating platform just below. The main facility, consisting of various buildings and towers on a rocky outcrop with some structures emitting a red glow, occupies the center and right portions of the screen, while a small map inset of the Atlantic Ocean is visible in the bottom-left corner. The underwater view is rendered in murky teal tones with red and white light sources. Stationary horizontal scan lines run across the display, giving it a corrupted, low-fidelity appearance. The image then abruptly glitches and transitions to a distorted corporate photograph under a yellow, pixelated \"WAU\" logo in the upper left. This second image is heavily corrupted, with fixed digital artifacts and pixelation obscuring the faces of a group of people centered on the screen, accompanied by the slogan \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" written below them. Both images are overlaid with horizontal scan lines, maintaining the corrupted appearance. The camera remains static and at the monitor's level throughout the shot, capturing the flickering transitions between the two scenes.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a full shot of a green-gray, retro-style computer monitor. The screen first shows a glitchy, digital schematic of a sprawling underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" located at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters. The facility consists of various buildings and towers on a rocky outcrop, with some structures emitting a red glow. To the left, a large, ram-like skull is mounted on a floating platform. A small map inset is visible in the lower-left corner. The display then flickers to a distorted corporate image under a yellow, pixelated \"WAU\" logo. This image shows a group of people whose faces are heavily obscured by digital artifacts, with the slogan \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" written below them. Both images are overlaid with horizontal scan lines, giving them a corrupted, low-fidelity appearance.",
    "Motion": "On a computer monitor, a digital schematic of an underwater facility flickers with stationary horizontal scan lines across the display. The image then abruptly glitches and transitions to a distorted corporate photo. This second image is also heavily corrupted, with fixed digital artifacts and pixelation obscuring the faces of the people pictured, while the scan lines remain stationary on the screen.",
    "Scene": "A monitor is set within a weathered, greenish-gray industrial frame in a dark environment. The screen displays a corrupted video feed characterized by horizontal scan lines and digital glitches. The feed flickers between two scenes: one is a depiction of an underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" situated at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters, with a small map of the Atlantic Ocean visible in the corner. The other scene is a heavily distorted corporate photograph of a team, captioned \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" with a \"WAU\" logo in the upper left. The underwater view is rendered in murky teal tones with red and white light sources, while the corporate image is pixelated, obscuring the faces of the individuals.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot frames a computer monitor, which is prominently positioned in the foreground. The screen initially displays a schematic of an underwater facility. Text and a logo for \"PATHOS-II\" are positioned in the top-left corner of the screen, with a large, skull-like object on a platform just below. The main facility occupies the center and right portions of the screen, while a small map is located in the bottom-left corner. The image on the screen then glitches and transitions to a corporate photo, where a logo appears in the top left, a group of people is centered, and a slogan is positioned at the bottom center. The camera remains static and at the monitor's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
