  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of three brown horses with saddles on a grassy and rocky terrain. The main subject, a horse with a dark brown coat and darker mane, is positioned in the foreground, slightly to the right, with its head lowered as it grazes. The camera begins with a high-angle view, looking down at the horses, then moves to eye level and slightly tilts upward to a level angle, focusing on the horse in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera is quite unsteady, moving without a clear pattern. The main horse maintains its position and focus in the foreground, its tail swaying gently as it eats. In the middle ground, two other horses are visible; one is slightly to the left and the other to the right, facing different directions, which adds depth. The horse on the right is also grazing and facing to the right, while the horse on the left is standing still, not grazing, and facing to the left. The background features a rugged, mountainous landscape under a bright sky, providing a sense of openness and tranquility. The ground is a mix of dirt and patches of green grass, and the saddles are made of leather, adding a rustic element to the natural environment. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the vast landscape providing a sense of openness and tranquility. The spatial arrangement remains consistent throughout the video, with the main horse maintaining its position and focus in the foreground. The mountainous backdrop emphasizes the horses' presence in the landscape, and the clear view of distant, layered hills under a bright sky suggests daytime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
