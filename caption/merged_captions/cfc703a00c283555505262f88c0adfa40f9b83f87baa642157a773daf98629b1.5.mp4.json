  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a wide view of a river landscape, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. The fast-flowing river, with dark, turbulent water and white rapids, occupies the bottom half of the frame, moving from the background toward the foreground. A rocky bank lined with green trees is positioned in the left middle ground, while a broader, pebble-strewn bank is on the right. In the background, green mountains, some with lighter-toned, exposed patches of earth or rock, rise under a bright blue sky dotted with large, white, puffy cumulus clouds that fill the top of the frame. The camera begins above the water, maintaining a level angle, and then smoothly ascends to an aerial level. It employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where both the foreground river and distant mountains are sharp. The camera moves steadily forward, upward, and to the left, offering an expanding view of the river and its surroundings. The drone gradually ascends, revealing a more expansive view of the river and the surrounding mountainous landscape, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a particular object.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a wide, fast-flowing river with white-capped rapids and rocks scattered within the river itself, flanked by rocky riverbanks. On the left bank, a line of green trees and vegetation extends towards distant, hazy mountains and leads up to a steep, tree-covered hill with exposed, lighter-colored patches of earth or rock. The right bank is a broad expanse of lighter-colored rocks and pebbles. The sky above is blue with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment, the dynamic movement of the water, and the overall atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a particular object.",
    "Motion": "This video shows a scenic view of a wide, flowing river with some rapids. The river is flanked by stony banks, with a line of green trees on one side and a larger, tree-covered hill in the distance under a blue sky with white clouds. The camera slowly moves forward and slightly upwards, offering an aerial perspective of the landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a river with dark, turbulent water and white rapids flowing through flat river plains adjacent to the mountains. Both riverbanks are wide and composed of numerous grey and white rounded stones. A line of green trees follows the left bank, with more dense green vegetation covering the mountains in the background. These mountains, some with lighter-toned, exposed patches of earth or rock, rise under a bright blue sky dotted with large, white, puffy cumulus clouds. The drone gradually ascends, revealing a more expansive view of the river and the surrounding mountainous landscape.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery shot begins with a wide view of a river landscape, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. The fast-flowing river occupies the bottom half of the frame, moving from the background toward the foreground. A rocky bank lined with green trees is positioned in the left middle ground, while a broader, pebble-strewn bank is on the right. In the background, green mountains rise under a blue sky with white clouds that fill the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at a level angle, slowly moves forward and ascends, transitioning the view into an extreme wide shot that reveals a more expansive perspective of the river and the surrounding mountainous terrain."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
