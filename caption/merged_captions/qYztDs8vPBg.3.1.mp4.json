  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a smartphone with a flat-sided, gold-colored metal frame is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame and held by a finger visible at the bottom left. In the middle ground, a person's hand with a light skin tone holds a silver, metallic utility knife with its sharp, triangular razor blade extended. The knife is held by two fingers visible at the bottom right, with the blade extending toward the left and inserted into the narrow earpiece slit at the top edge of the phone, in the seam between the dark glass screen and the metal frame. The blade's point is positioned precisely in the gap where the glass meets the frame. The camera, with an extremely shallow depth of field, focuses on the midground, specifically on the top edge of the smartphone where the razor blade is being inserted. The shot is smooth and steady. The utility knife blade is then quickly withdrawn from the phone, moving from left to right, causing the phone to move slightly. The entire scene is set against a plain white background, with the camera positioned at the subject's level.",

    "Subject": "A person's hand with a light skin tone holds a smartphone that has a flat-sided, gold-colored metal frame. In the other hand, a silver, metallic utility knife is held, with its sharp, triangular razor blade extended. The pointed tip of the blade is carefully inserted into the narrow earpiece slit at the top edge of the phone, in the seam between the dark glass screen and the metal frame.",
    "Motion": "A utility knife blade is inserted into the seam between the screen and frame of a smartphone and then quickly withdrawn.",
    "Scene": "Against a plain white background, an extreme close-up shot captures a smartphone with a metallic, champagne-colored frame being held in one hand. With the other hand, a person carefully inserts the tip of a silver utility knife blade into the thin seam between the phone's dark screen and its metal casing, near the top edge. The blade's point is positioned precisely in the gap where the glass meets the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
