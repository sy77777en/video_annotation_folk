  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a person with a muscular build and blonde hair is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, seen from the back. They are shirtless, wearing a black harness with two straps over their shoulders, and are illuminated by a cool, blue light from an unseen source in front of them. The background consists of dark, vertically corrugated panels, while in the blurred foreground, various pieces of scientific apparatus are visible on the left and right, creating a sense of depth. Initially, the person's arms are down, but they slowly raise both hands to shoulder height with their palms facing forward. The camera captures this from a low-angle, hip-level shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the person in the foreground. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot, though there is a slight unsteadiness.",

    "Camera": "This is a low-angle, hip-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the man in the foreground. The camera is static but has a slight unsteadiness.",
    "Subject": "A person with a muscular build and blonde hair is seen from the back, wearing a black harness with two straps over their shoulders. They raise their hands to shoulder height with palms facing forward.",
    "Motion": "A person, seen from behind, slowly raises both arms until their hands are at shoulder height with their palms facing forward.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting that resembles a laboratory, a person with blonde hair is seen from behind. Their shirtless back, marked by black straps over the shoulders, is illuminated by a cool, blue light from an unseen source in front of them. The background consists of dark, vertically corrugated panels. In the blurred foreground, various pieces of scientific apparatus are visible.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. Behind them, dark, vertically corrugated panels form the background. In the blurred background, scientific apparatus is visible on the left and right, creating a sense of depth. The person, initially with their arms down, raises both hands to shoulder height with their palms facing forward. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
