  "merged_caption": "This full shot presents a tall, dark gray, rectangular monolith positioned in the center of the frame, floating vertically in the middle ground above a body of water. The monolith, composed of several stacked geometric segments, subtly shifts and reconfigures its shape, with each segment moving relative to the others while the entire structure remains stationary. Rippling waves occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, and a dense, white fog fills the middle ground and background, obscuring the horizon. The scene depicts a misty, overcast seascape with the ocean stretching into the distance under a gray sky, creating a serene and otherworldly atmosphere. The camera, positioned aerially above the sea, predominantly maintains a level angle with subtle upward tilts and forward movement, capturing the scene with a large depth of field. The movement remains smooth with minimal shaking, and while the shot seems to employ deep focus, the background's lack of clarity due to the thick fog makes this challenging to confirm. The monolith stands as the central visual element, appearing dark against the pale backdrop, and does not interact with the water or move from its position. The water below shows small, continuous rippling waves, and the entire scene is heavily obscured by the dense fog, with no overlays or additional elements present. The camera's subtle movements throughout the video enhance the mysterious and tranquil ambiance, as the monolith's internal segments continue to rearrange themselves, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise calm and static environment. The time of day is indeterminate due to the uniform lighting and foggy conditions, further contributing to the enigmatic quality of the scene.",

    "Subject": "A tall, dark gray, rectangular monolith floats vertically in the center of the scene, suspended above a body of water with small, rippling waves. The monolith appears to be composed of several stacked, geometric segments that subtly shift and reconfigure their shape. The entire scene is heavily obscured by a dense, white fog.",
    "Motion": "The monolith remains suspended above the water, maintaining a vertical orientation as it floats in place. Its stacked geometric segments gradually shift and reconfigure, with each segment subtly moving relative to the others. There is no horizontal or vertical displacement of the entire monolith; only the internal segments exhibit motion as they rearrange themselves. The water below shows small, continuous rippling waves, but the monolith itself does not interact with the water or move from its position.",
    "Scene": "The scene depicts a misty, overcast seascape with a mysterious, vertical structure that appears to be suspended in midair above the water. The setting is outdoors, with the ocean stretching into the distance under a gray sky. The time of day is indeterminate due to the uniform lighting and foggy conditions. The structure is a tall, rectangular form with a smooth surface, appearing dark against the pale backdrop. The water is calm, with gentle waves lapping at the shore, and the entire scene is enveloped in a thick fog that obscures the horizon. The atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the structure standing as the central visual element. There are no overlays or additional elements present in the scene.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot presents a tall, rectangular monolith positioned in the center of the frame, floating in the middle ground above a body of water. Rippling waves occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while a dense fog fills the middle ground and background, obscuring the horizon. The monolith remains stationary in its central position, though its internal segments subtly shift and reconfigure. The camera is positioned at the monolith's level and exhibits subtle movements throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
