  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot, a man with long, blond hair tied back and some facial stubble is positioned in the left-center of the frame, sitting in the foreground on a rocky, scree-covered mountaintop. He is wearing a short-sleeved green t-shirt, dark gray shorts, and yellow and black shoes with red laces. A large piece of bright yellow and blue fabric, which appears to be a paraglider or wingsuit, is spread out around him, occupying the bottom-center foreground, while a black backpack with the word \"Apex\" on it sits in the bottom-left. The immediate foreground and middle ground consist of rocky terrain, with a few patches of snow visible near a cliff edge in the left middle ground. A vast mountain range extends across the entire background, situated beneath a sky filled with large, white clouds that fill the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to ensure that both the man preparing his gear in the foreground and the expansive mountain range in the background are in sharp focus. The man is focused on putting on a piece of equipment, lifting his right leg to pull the yellow and blue fabric harness over his foot. Using both hands, he works the harness up his leg and lifts the yellow fabric up so that his right leg and foot pass through. The scene captures the man in the act of adjusting the straps of the fabric, preparing his gear amidst the barren and rocky environment, with green valleys below and other peaks visible in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
