  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a level, forward-moving perspective. Initially, a dirt path occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. It is flanked by blurred green trees on the left and right, creating a tunnel-like composition with a patch of bright sky visible in the top-center background. The camera flies smoothly forward along the dirt road, offering a fast-paced, drone view of a journey through a lush, green landscape. To navigate a left turn, it pans slightly left and rolls counterclockwise, then continues forward, rolling clockwise, which creates a dynamic, varying Dutch angle throughout the shot. As the drone advances, the view expands to reveal flat green meadows on both sides, surrounded by vibrant green grass and leafy trees on a bright, sunny day. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds, and the sun adds to the vibrant rural scenery. In the middle ground and background, several houses appear on the top-right of the frame, situated on a gentle slope and surrounded by trees, further enriching the landscape. The fast-paced perspective emphasizes the atmosphere and dynamic movement through the countryside, rather than focusing on any particular object. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, while subtle barrel distortion adds a unique visual effect to the edges of the frame. As the drone speeds forward and tilts, the scenery blurs significantly, creating streaks of green and brown, enhancing the sense of speed and immersion. The bright blue sky, dotted with a few white clouds and a brilliant sun, expands to fill the top and top-right portions of the frame, completing the vibrant rural scenery.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, a fast-moving drone camera flies smoothly forward along a dirt road. To navigate a left turn, it pans slightly left and rolls counterclockwise. It then continues forward, rolling clockwise, which creates a dynamic, varying Dutch angle throughout the shot. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, while subtle barrel distortion adds a unique visual effect to the edges of the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a rapid journey along a dirt road through a narrow passage, bordered by trees on both sides, creating a significant motion blur effect. As the camera progresses, the view opens up to reveal flat green fields on either side, enhancing the sense of speed and immersion. The bright blue sky, dotted with a few white clouds and a brilliant sun, adds to the vibrant rural scenery. In the distance, several houses are visible on a gentle slope, surrounded by trees, further enriching the landscape. The fast-paced perspective emphasizes the atmosphere and dynamic movement through the countryside, rather than focusing on any particular object.",
    "Motion": "This video offers a fast-paced, drone view of a journey through a lush, green landscape. The camera glides along a dirt path, flanked by vibrant grass and trees. In the background, houses are visible on a hillside under a sunny, blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight along a dirt path in a rural, countryside setting. The journey begins with the camera following a dirt road through a narrow passage flanked by trees on both sides. As the drone progresses, the view expands to reveal a flat green meadow on either side. The path is surrounded by vibrant green grass and leafy trees on a bright, sunny day. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds. As the drone speeds forward and tilts, the scenery blurs significantly, creating streaks of green and brown. In the background, several houses are visible on a gentle slope, surrounded by trees.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
