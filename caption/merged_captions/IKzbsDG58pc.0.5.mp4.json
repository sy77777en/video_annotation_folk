  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a dark, indistinct background as the top of an older woman's head enters from the bottom of the frame. She has long, stringy, wet, blonde hair that falls along the sides of her cheeks and the back of her neck. The camera, from a noticeably unstable, eye-level perspective, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the elderly person in the foreground. The shot includes some movement, with noticeable shaking. The woman moves slightly left of center as the camera tilts up to reveal her face, which is illuminated by a warm, orange-toned light. She appears shirtless, with her bare shoulders visible. The shot transitions into a medium close-up, with the woman positioned in the center-left. As she lifts her head, her eyes wide and mouth slightly agape, she raises her open hands into the foreground, looking down at them with a startled expression. The background, while mostly dark, is not entirely black; subtle elements suggest it might be the interior wall of a hut, with long, possibly wooden sticks forming a frame against a textured wall. A warm, low light source from the front casts a yellow-orange glow, creating deep shadows that highlight her features and wet hair. The woman remains illuminated by this warm light from the front, while the background stays dark and undefined. The camera maintains a consistent eye-level angle throughout.",

    "Subject": "The video reveals an older, pale-skinned woman in a shot that begins with a slight downward tilt, then pans slightly to the right, and finally tilts slightly upward to show her face. She has long, stringy, wet, blonde hair that falls along the sides of her cheeks and the back of her neck. She appears shirtless, with her bare shoulders visible. As her face comes into full view, she lifts her head, her eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. She then raises her open hands in front of her, looking down at them with a startled expression. Her skin is illuminated by a warm, orange-toned light.",
    "Motion": "The older woman rises up, her head entering the frame. She raises her open hands in front of her face and looks down at them.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit setting, a woman with long, wet blonde hair enters the scene from the bottom and moves to the center-left, where she is captured in a medium close-up. A warm, low light source from the front casts a yellow-orange glow, creating deep shadows that highlight her features and wet hair. The background, while mostly dark, is not entirely black; subtle elements suggest it might be the interior wall of a hut, with long, possibly wooden sticks forming a frame against a textured wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
