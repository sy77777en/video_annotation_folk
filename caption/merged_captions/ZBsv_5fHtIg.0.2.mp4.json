  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a dark-colored, possibly black, BMW car is positioned centrally in the frame and in the middle ground, facing directly towards the viewer. The car's daytime running lights are illuminated, displaying a distinctive circular pattern. The camera is placed at the car's level on a paved surface that extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame towards the vehicle. The scene is set in an urban environment at dusk, with the car remaining stationary throughout the video. The ground-level, level-angle shot smoothly moves backward from the BMW, transitioning from regular speed to fast motion to effectively highlight the speed ramp effect. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the car and the background elements sharp. In the background, slightly to the left behind the car, a large, modern cable-stayed bridge with tall, angled pylons and numerous cables is visible against a bright, pale sky. Multi-story buildings stand on both the right and left sides, with a building occupying the right side of the frame in the background and a portion of another building visible on the far left in the middle ground. Dark foliage is situated on both the left and right sides of the car, also in the middle ground, primarily behind the car and mostly on the right side. The car's wide, low-slung appearance is characteristic of a sports model, and its distinctively shaped white daytime running lights contrast with its dark body, which is mostly in shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
