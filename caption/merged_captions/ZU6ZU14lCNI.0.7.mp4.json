  "merged_caption": "The video opens on a wide shot of an ornate room, with a large, dark-framed window positioned in the middle ground. Through the window, a park with snow and bare trees is visible in the background under a cloudy sky extending further into the distance. A woman with blonde, shoulder-length hair, wearing a tan coat and carrying a dark purse over her shoulder, enters from the right foreground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot as she walks toward the window. The camera, at eye-level and with a slight unsteadiness mimicking the perspective of someone walking, follows her movement. As she approaches the window and stops in the center foreground with her back to the camera, which is positioned at her level, the view reveals additional buildings on the left side, complementing the always-visible large, metallic, bean-shaped sculpture in the park outside. This sculpture, known as the Cloud Gate, is situated among bare trees under a cloudy, twilight sky. As the camera moves closer to the window, the light fixtures that were originally in the upper right and left corners of the middle ground disappear from the frame, while the marble walls and window shift to the foreground, framing the scene. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the interior and the exterior cityscape sharp. From inside the dimly lit, ornate room with marble-paneled walls and a patterned carpet, the large window looks out onto Chicago's Millennium Park at dusk. The ground below is covered in snow, and leafless trees line a street with sparse traffic. In the distance, the reflective, curved form of the Cloud Gate sculpture is visible against a sky with soft clouds.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot. The camera moves with a slight unsteadiness, mimicking the perspective of someone walking, as it follows a woman toward a large window. As it approaches, the camera pans left to reveal the view. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the interior and the exterior cityscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "A woman with blonde, shoulder-length hair, wearing a tan coat and carrying a dark purse over her shoulder, walks from the right side of the scene toward a large window. As she approaches the window and stops with her back to the viewer, additional buildings become visible in the park outside, complementing the always-visible, metallic, bean-shaped sculpture situated among bare trees under a cloudy, twilight sky.",
    "Motion": "A woman walks into the frame from the right and moves toward a large window. As she approaches, the view reveals additional buildings on the left side, complementing the always-visible large, metallic, bean-shaped sculpture in the park outside.",
    "Scene": "From inside a dimly lit, ornate room with marble-paneled walls and a patterned carpet, a large window looks out onto Chicago's Millennium Park at dusk. The ground below is covered in snow, and leafless trees line a street with sparse traffic. In the distance, the reflective, curved form of the Cloud Gate sculpture is visible against a sky with soft clouds. A woman in a tan coat approaches the window and stands looking out at the wintery cityscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens on a wide shot of an ornate room, with a large, dark-framed window positioned in the middle ground. Through the window, a park with snow and bare trees is visible in the background under a cloudy sky extending further into the distance. A woman then enters from the right foreground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot as she walks toward the window. She stops in the center foreground, with her back to the camera, which is positioned at her level. As she settles into this position, a large, metallic sculpture is revealed through the window, situated center outside in the background. As the camera moves closer to the window, the light fixtures that were originally in the upper right and left corners of the middle ground disappear from the frame, while the marble walls and window shift to the foreground, framing the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
