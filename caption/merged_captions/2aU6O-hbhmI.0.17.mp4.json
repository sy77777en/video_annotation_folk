  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, capturing a tall residential building prominently in the center of the frame. Initially, the building occupies most of the frame, with its facade featuring numerous windows and balconies. It is positioned centrally in the 2D space and in the middle ground of the 3D scene. Surrounding structures, such as a smaller brick building, appear in the background, situated towards the left side of the frame. The camera maintains a height slightly below the building, emphasizing its verticality. The video begins with a view of a tall building with a red and glass facade, set against a cloudy sky during dusk. The camera drone is at an aerial level, with the angle mostly level, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera drone primarily flies forward, occasionally tilting slightly upward to a low-angle perspective, smoothly, with brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, as if testing motion controls. As the video progresses, the camera advances towards the building, alternating its rotation between clockwise and counterclockwise while slightly tilting upwards. The sky, overcast and dusky, forms the backdrop, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The transition showcases the building's architectural details and the urban environment around it. As the camera continues to approach, the lighting from the building's lights and the setting sun becomes more prominent. Finally, the camera focuses on a specific balcony where two people are standing, visible against the backdrop of the building and the sunset. The man on the left is wearing a navy blue shirt and white shorts, while the man on the right is dressed in a pink shirt and jeans. The illuminated windows against the dusky sky and the presence of other buildings contribute to the overall atmosphere of the urban landscape.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a cityscape scenery, initially highlighting the urban environment and architecture of a tall building with numerous windows and balconies. As the scene unfolds, the focus shifts to two men standing on a balcony. The man on the left is wearing a navy blue shirt and white shorts, while the man on the right is dressed in a pink shirt and jeans. The illuminated windows against the dusky sky and the presence of other buildings contribute to the overall atmosphere of the urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a tall building with a red and glass facade, set against a cloudy sky during dusk. The camera moves closer to the building, capturing more details of the structure, including the balconies and windows. As the camera continues to approach, the lighting from the building's lights and the setting sun becomes more prominent. The camera angle shifts slightly, revealing more of the building's side and the surrounding area. Finally, the camera focuses on a specific balcony where two people are standing, visible against the backdrop of the building and the sunset.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment at dusk. The setting features a tall, modern residential building with a red and gray facade, characterized by large glass windows and balconies. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene. Surrounding the main building are other structures, including a smaller brick building. The drone's movement provides a dynamic perspective, initially showcasing the building's height and architectural details before focusing on the balconies, where people are visible. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the city lights beginning to glow as evening approaches.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
