  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a landscape at night, captured from an aerial-level, level-angle perspective. A highway occupies the bottom third of the frame, with bright white and yellow streaks from approaching headlights flowing from the bottom center background to the left foreground, while red streaks from receding taillights flow from the right foreground to the bottom center background of the horizon in the distance. The long exposure captures the movement of cars, creating these bright light trails that stretch into the distance. A dark, silhouetted landscape stretches horizontally from the foreground to the background. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a stormy sky in the background, filled with dark, turbulent clouds. Large bolts of lightning flash in the upper portions of the frame, striking down toward the horizon. The sky is spectacularly illuminated by frequent, powerful flashes of lightning, with the color shifting from a dark, reddish-purple to a brighter violet during the lightning flashes. The scene is intermittently illuminated by these powerful, branching bolts of white lightning that strike down from the clouds. In the distance, a faint orange glow on the horizon is visible beneath the storm, and vertical sheets of rain can be seen falling. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring that both the light trails on the highway and the dramatic lightning in the sky remain clear. The video is a time-lapse, capturing the dynamic interplay of light and motion as the storm unfolds over the highway, creating a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured at night.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video captured from an aerial-level, level-angle perspective. The shot maintains a deep focus, ensuring that both the light trails on the highway and the dramatic lightning in the sky remain clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured at night. The focus is not on a singular subject. A dark, stormy sky, tinged with deep purple and orange hues, dominates the frame as brilliant, forked lightning bolts repeatedly flash and strike down toward the distant horizon. Below, a highway cuts through the darkened terrain, its path defined by the continuous, glowing light trails of vehicles: bright white and yellow streaks from approaching headlights on the left, and red streaks from receding taillights on the right, all converging toward the horizon in the distance.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic lightning storm over a highway at night. The long exposure captures the movement of cars, creating bright white and red light trails that stretch into the distance. The sky is filled with dark, turbulent clouds that are spectacularly illuminated by frequent, powerful flashes of lightning.",
    "Scene": "At night, a straight highway stretches toward the horizon across a dark, flat landscape. The road is defined by long, continuous light trails from traffic: white and yellow streaks on the left and red streaks on the right. Above, the sky is filled with dark, heavy storm clouds. The scene is intermittently illuminated by powerful, branching bolts of white lightning that strike down from the clouds. In the distance, a faint orange glow on the horizon is visible beneath the storm, and vertical sheets of rain can be seen falling. The color of the sky shifts from a dark, reddish-purple to a brighter violet during the lightning flashes.",

A dark, silhouetted landscape stretches horizontally from the foreground to the background. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a stormy sky in the background. Large bolts of lightning flash in the upper portions of the frame, striking down toward the horizon. The camera is positioned at an aerial height, looking down the highway into the distance."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
