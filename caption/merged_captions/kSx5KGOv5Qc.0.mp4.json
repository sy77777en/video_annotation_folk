  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a coastal city, captured from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, a rocky, green hillside spans the bottom of the frame, with sparse vegetation and some grasses gently swaying in the wind, adding a subtle sense of movement to the scene. The historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, is the central element in the middle ground, with its dense cluster of buildings featuring iconic orange-tiled roofs, all enclosed by massive, light-gray stone fortifications. The city's harbor, filled with numerous white boats, is positioned on its left side, where the water is a vibrant turquoise. A cable car tower stands in the bottom right, descending towards the urban area. The deep blue Adriatic Sea fills the background at the top of the frame, with a small, tree-covered island in the top left under clear skies. A watermark for \"Xscion.org\" with the word \"COPYRIGHT\" is present in the top left corner as an overlay. The camera, from a mountain vantage point, provides a high-angle view that looks downward, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire landscape, from the foreground rocks to the distant city and sea, sharp and clear. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a very slow and subtle zoom-in, causing the city to gradually increase in size within the frame, emphasizing the grand scale, stunning location, and overall atmosphere of the entire city and its relationship with the surrounding natural landscape.",

    "Camera": "From a mountain vantage point, the camera provides a high-angle view that looks downward, slowly zooming in on the walled coastal city. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape, from the foreground rocks to the distant city and sea, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a breathtaking panoramic view of a historic walled city on a peninsula. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with iconic terracotta-orange roofs, all enclosed by formidable ancient stone walls that meet the deep blue sea. A small harbor, filled with numerous white boats, is nestled into the city's edge where the water is a vibrant turquoise. The perspective is from a rocky, green mountainside in the foreground, with a cable car tower visible on the right, descending towards the urban area. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale, stunning location, and overall atmosphere of the entire city and its relationship with the surrounding natural landscape, rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a static or very slowly moving scenic shot. The camera captures a breathtaking high-angle view of a historic walled city on a peninsula, surrounded by the deep blue sea. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with iconic orange-tiled roofs, enclosed by formidable stone fortifications. A small harbor with numerous boats is visible on the left, and a lush, green island can be seen in the distance. The vantage point is a rocky, verdant mountainside, with a cable car pylon prominent on the right. In the foreground, some grasses gently sway in the wind, adding a subtle sense of movement to the scene.",
    "Scene": "From a high, rocky vantage point, the scene captures a panoramic view of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, situated on a peninsula jutting into the deep blue Adriatic Sea. The city is a dense collection of buildings with characteristic orange-red terracotta roofs, all enclosed by massive, light-gray stone fortifications. A small harbor with numerous docked white boats is tucked into the city's edge, where the water is a vibrant turquoise. In the foreground, the rocky, green hillside is dotted with sparse vegetation. To the right, a modern cable car pylon stands out against the historic backdrop. In the distance, a small, tree-covered island sits in the calm sea under clear skies. A watermark for \"Xscion.org\" with the word \"COPYRIGHT\" is present in the top left corner as an overlay.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
