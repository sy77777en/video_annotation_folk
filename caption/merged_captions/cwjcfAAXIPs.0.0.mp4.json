  "merged_caption": "This is a smooth, slow-moving aerial shot of a cityscape at sunrise, with the camera positioned at a high angle. The scene is primarily a scenery shot focused on the environment. A dense layer of fog fills the lower two-thirds of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. In the middle ground, a white church is positioned on the right, emerging from the fog. On the far left, parts of the city are also visible above the fog. In the background, the sun is located in the top center, just above the horizon line formed by distant hills. The camera drifts forward over a city covered in fog at sunrise, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape sharp. The sun peeks over distant hills, casting a warm, golden glow on the sea of clouds. The thick fog fills the valley like a sea of clouds, obscuring most of the urban landscape below. On a hill to the right, a white church with a dark roof stands prominently above the mist. The camera performs a slow, steady aerial movement, offering a serene and expansive view of the stunning landscape. The low sun on the horizon bathes the scene in a warm, golden light, illuminating the tops of the clouds. Only the highest points of the city are visible, including a distinctive white church perched on a hill to the right and the silhouettes of other buildings and distant hills in the background. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the grand, ethereal atmosphere created by the vast blanket of fog and the soft morning light, emphasizing the scale and mood of the environment.",

    "Motion": "This is a breathtaking aerial shot of a city at sunrise, blanketed in a thick layer of fog. The sun peeks over distant hills, casting a warm, golden glow on the sea of clouds. On the right, a historic-looking church or monastery sits on a hilltop, emerging majestically from the mist. The camera performs a slow, steady aerial movement, offering a serene and expansive view of the stunning landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a city at sunrise, enveloped in a dense layer of white fog. The thick fog fills the valley like a sea of clouds, obscuring most of the urban landscape below. On a hill to the right, a white church with a dark roof stands prominently above the mist. In the background, the sun is a bright orb just above the horizon, casting a golden glow over distant hills and the top of the cloud-like fog. Parts of the city are visible in the distance and on the left, emerging from the low-lying clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
