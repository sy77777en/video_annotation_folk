  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a subject-level perspective, frames the Trevi Fountain in the middle ground and background, initially occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame from the center to the left, and later from the center to the right. A large crowd of people fills the bottom one-third of the frame, gathered in front of the massive Baroque fountain integrated into the facade of the Palazzo Poli, a large, classical-style building made of light-colored stone. The fountain's centerpiece is a large statue of a muscular man with a beard standing on a shell, flanked by other statues of figures and horses set among sculpted rocks. The building features classical columns, additional sculptures in niches, and a prominent Latin inscription along the top. Reddish-orange residential buildings with either dark-shuttered or green-shuttered windows are visible in the background on both sides. This time-lapse video features a camera smoothly moving in a counterclockwise arc around the scene, capturing the dynamic crowd in front of the fountain as people continuously change positions. The camera performs a smooth counterclockwise arc around the scene, adding dynamic movement to the composition. A deep focus keeps the entire view, from the crowd in the foreground to the buildings in the background, in sharp detail. The scene is set outdoors at the Trevi Fountain in Rome, viewed from within a crowd during what appears to be an overcast day.",

    "Subject": "In the foreground, a crowd of people is gathered in front of a large, ornate fountain. The crowd is looking towards a massive Baroque fountain integrated into the facade of a large, classical-style building made of light-colored stone. The fountain's central feature is a large statue of a muscular man with a beard standing on a shell, flanked by other statues of figures and horses set among sculpted rocks.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors at the Trevi Fountain in Rome, viewed from within a crowd during what appears to be an overcast day. The massive Baroque fountain, constructed from light-colored stone, is attached to the facade of the Palazzo Poli. The fountain's centerpiece is a large sculpture of a standing male figure in a central niche, surrounded by other statues and intricate rock formations. The building features classical columns, additional sculptures in niches, and a prominent Latin inscription along the top. In the foreground, numerous people gather to look at the monument. To both sides of the fountain, portions of a reddish-orange residential building with either dark-shuttered or green-shuttered windows can be seen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
