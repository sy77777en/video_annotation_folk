  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a dark, cylindrical water sprayer positioned in the right foreground, actively spraying a fine, fan-shaped mist upwards. The camera, slightly unsteady, is at a ground-level, level angle and uses a shallow depth of field. Initially, the focus is on the sprinkler, with blurred rocks and green foliage occupying the middle ground. The scene is set at night on dark, damp ground, with the water spray illuminated, creating a bright contrast with the dark surroundings. The camera then performs a slow rack focus to shift attention to the middle ground, where a brownish-green frog with a light-colored throat pouch appears on a rock in the center-left of the frame, its throat pouch inflating and deflating. A second, more vibrant green frog with a bluish tint materializes on an adjacent rock just to the left of the first, also sitting still as its throat pouch moves. Finally, a third, smaller green frog jumps into the frame from the lower left, landing on the ground in the middle ground, slightly in front of the other two frogs, but not on a rock. The frogs are positioned facing the sprinkler. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamics of the scene as the frogs enter and settle into their positions.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from a ground-level, level angle.\n\nThe camera uses a shallow depth of field, beginning with the focus on a sprinkler in the foreground. It then performs a slow rack focus to shift attention to the frogs in the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video initially focuses on a dark, cylindrical water sprayer in the foreground, which is actively spraying water upwards in a fine, fan-shaped mist. The focus then shifts to the middle ground, revealing a brownish-green frog with a light-colored throat pouch sitting on a dark rock. A second, more vibrant green frog with a bluish tint appears on an adjacent rock. Finally, a third, smaller green frog jumps into the scene from the lower left, landing near the other two but not on a rock. The frogs are positioned facing the sprinkler.",
    "Motion": "A water sprinkler continuously sprays a fine mist upwards. A brown frog appears on a rock, its throat pouch inflating and deflating. A second, green frog materializes on an adjacent rock, also sitting still as its throat pouch moves. A third, smaller green frog then jumps into the frame from the lower left, landing on the ground in front of the other two.",
    "Scene": "At night, from a level-angle perspective, a dark, cylindrical pop-up sprinkler head sprays a fine mist of water upwards. The scene is set on dark, damp ground with several rocks and blurred green foliage in the middle ground. The water spray is illuminated, creating a bright contrast with the dark surroundings. During the sequence, three brownish-green frogs enter the scene, with two positioning themselves on the rocks near the sprinkler.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a water sprayer positioned in the right foreground, with blurred rocks and foliage occupying the middle ground. The focus then racks from the sprayer to the middle ground, where a frog hops onto a rock in the center-left of the frame. A second frog then enters, settling on another rock just to the left of the first. Finally, a third frog jumps into the shot from the bottom left, landing on the ground in the middle ground, slightly in front of the other two frogs. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
