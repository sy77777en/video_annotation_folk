  "merged_caption": "The video is a medium shot, with an older woman positioned in the left-middle ground and a younger man in the right-middle ground. A dense line of trees and a green lawn form the background across the width of the frame. The woman, who has short, white hair and fair skin, is wearing a white t-shirt with a prominent red and blue American flag design. She initially holds a green, somewhat deflated, pliable object resembling a water-filled balloon. The younger man, with short brown hair, a brown beard, and fair skin, is wearing a red t-shirt featuring a graphic of a truck with the American flag integrated into its design and the word \"USA\" in large letters. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a fixed but slightly unsteady shot, and employs a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground in focus. The video showcases a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between normal and slow motion. The woman actively throws or pushes the green object from the left towards the right side of the younger man's head. As the action unfolds, the man stands with his hands on his hips, facing forward with a neutral expression, and closes his eyes as the green object makes contact with the side of his head, causing the object to deform. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the action, capturing the moment the water balloon deforms in slow motion upon impact. The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, with a mowed green lawn extending from the midground to the background, and a dense line of tall, green trees forming the backdrop. The sky is not visible.",

    "Subject": "An older woman with short, white hair and fair skin, wearing a white t-shirt with a prominent red and blue American flag design, stands on the left. She is holding a green, somewhat deflated, pliable object resembling a water-filled balloon, which she then pushes towards the head of a younger man standing to her right.

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, with a mowed green lawn extending from the midground to the background, and a dense line of tall, green trees forming the backdrop. The sky is not visible. Two individuals are present; one, an older person with white hair, wears a white t-shirt with a red and blue American flag design and holds a green, oblong water balloon. The other, a younger person with short brown hair, wears a red t-shirt featuring a graphic of a truck with the American flag integrated into its design and the word \"USA\" in large letters. The water balloon is shown in slow motion, deforming as it makes contact with the younger person's head.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
