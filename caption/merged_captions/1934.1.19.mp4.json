  "merged_caption": "The video features a full shot of a person dressed in a form-fitting, full-body white suit with orange stripes, including a helmet and gloves, standing on a dark platform. The individual appears to be male, with a light skin tone visible on the face. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground against a stark black background, creating a dramatic contrast. The platform is centrally located in the lower half of the frame, with a clean white border at the very bottom foreground, enhancing the geometric simplicity of the scene. The camera captures the subject from head to toe, maintaining a consistent shot size throughout the sequence, with a level camera angle and deep focus, ensuring a direct and stable perspective. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement, maintaining a large depth of field. The person in the white suit begins by standing facing forward, then turns to their left, showing the side profile of the suit. They walk forward slightly, then turn back to the front. After this, they turn to their right and then back to the front again while continuing to speak. The overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, emphasizing the visual elements through their simplicity and contrast, with the figure remaining the focal point due to its brightness against the dark backdrop. There are no significant changes in the spatial position or camera angle, maintaining a static and focused view of the subject throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "The video showcases a minimalist indoor setting with a stark black background, creating a dramatic contrast. A figure dressed in a bright white outfit stands prominently on a raised platform, drawing attention due to the high contrast with the dark surroundings. The platform is centrally positioned, with a clean, white border at the bottom, enhancing the geometric simplicity of the scene.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
