  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a woman with curly brown hair, partially tied back, wearing a beige coat, holding a fluffy, light brown dog adorned with a blue and white bandana with small patterns around its neck. Initially, the woman is facing the left side of the frame, showing her side profile, with the dog in her arms. They occupy the foreground, while the background includes a modern building with large glass windows and two men standing nearby. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the woman and dog with a shallow depth of field. As the video progresses, the woman walks forward, and the dog looks around as they move. The camera trucks slightly to the left, with slight shakiness, keeping the woman and dog in the center but shifting the background to reveal more of the outdoor seating area with wooden and metal furniture. The setting is lively, with people casually interacting in the background, enhanced by greenery, including potted plants and trees, contributing to a relaxed and inviting atmosphere. The woman turns her head to the right, positioning the back of her head towards the camera, while the dog remains in her arms. The camera maintains its position at the subject's level throughout, ensuring a consistent perspective. The transition between initial and final frames is smooth, with the primary focus remaining on the woman and dog as they move slightly within the frame. The scene includes a café or social space, likely a restaurant, with outdoor seating and greenery, suggesting a casual, outdoor environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
