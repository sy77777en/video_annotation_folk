  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high angle, initially looking down at two stylized, glowing white human figures standing side by side in the bottom center of the frame. They are depicted as featureless silhouettes, lacking any discernible clothing, hair, or facial details, but possessing a clear humanoid form with a head, torso, and limbs. The figures are situated in the middle ground of a dark, open courtyard. In the background, the dark facades of multi-story buildings enclose the scene, occupying the upper and side portions of the frame, with some windows brightly lit from within, suggesting a nighttime setting. The composition includes a subtle camera movement, as it moves downward and forward to get closer to the subjects. From a high angle, overhead level, the camera smoothly moves forward and down, tilting slightly to approach the two glowing figures. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The two glowing, stylized human figures remain completely stationary throughout the video, standing side by side in a dark courtyard without any discernible movement.",

    "Subject": "Two stylized, glowing white human figures stand side by side. They are depicted as featureless silhouettes, lacking any discernible clothing, hair, or facial details, but possessing a clear humanoid form with a head, torso, and limbs. Both are in a static standing pose.",
    "Motion": "The two glowing, stylized human figures remain completely stationary throughout the video, standing side by side in a dark courtyard without any discernible movement.",
    "Scene": "In a stark, black-and-white scene, a high-angle view looks down into a dark urban courtyard. The courtyard is enclosed by the dark facades of multi-story buildings, some of whose windows are brightly lit from within. In the center of the open, dark ground, two featureless, humanoid figures stand side-by-side, glowing with a soft white light that illuminates the area immediately around them. The animated digital video suggests a nighttime setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
