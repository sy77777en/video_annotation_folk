  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle full shot, a computer-generated model of a large, white, twin-engine passenger airplane is moving forward in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a gray paved surface resembling an airport runway or taxiway. The airplane moves from right to left on the runway, which intersects with another taxiway marked by a single yellow line. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green, grass-like terrain. The camera, from a high, aerial angle, slowly tracks the airplane on the runway, panning left and rolling counterclockwise to follow the subject. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, despite the slightly unsteady camera movement. A black banner containing text is overlaid at the bottom of the screen, featuring yellow text that reads \"JFK TWR:\" followed by white text that says \"American 106 Heavy, American 106 Heavy hold position.\"",

    "Subject": "A computer-generated animation displays a large, white, twin-engine passenger airplane model from a high-angle view. The aircraft is situated on a gray paved surface resembling an airport runway or taxiway, which is marked with yellow lines and surrounded by green, grass-like terrain. A black banner at the bottom of the screen features yellow text that reads \"JFK TWR:\" followed by white text that says \"American 106 Heavy, American 106 Heavy hold position.\"",
    "Motion": "A computer-generated model of a white airplane moves from right to left on the runway.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, a white, unmarked passenger airplane is moving forward on a wide, gray, textured runway at an airport. The runway intersects with a gray taxiway marked by a single yellow line. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green grass. A black overlay bar at the bottom of the screen displays yellow text, which reads \"JFK TWR:\" followed by the instruction \"American 106 Heavy, American 106 Heavy hold position\" in white text.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle full shot, a white airplane is moving forward in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The airplane is on a gray runway that intersects with another taxiway, both surrounded by green grass. The camera is rotating counterclockwise and panning. A black banner containing text is overlaid at the bottom of the screen."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
