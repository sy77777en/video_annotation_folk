  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a snow-covered mountain landscape. A prominent mountain peak, covered in snow and dense, snow-laden evergreen trees, occupies the center-left of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the center. A sea of thick, white clouds fills the middle ground, extending across the upper middle and right side of the frame, partially obscuring the valley below. In the background, a distant, jagged, snow-capped mountain range is visible in the top right, rising above the clouds under a clear, pale blue sky. The sky occupies the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking across and slightly down at the main peak. Throughout the shot, the camera smoothly and subtly moves forward and to the right, flying alongside the snow-covered mountain peak, causing a slight shift in the framing of the landscape. A deep focus keeps the entire mountain landscape, from the foreground peak to the distant clouds, sharp and clear. The composition is designed to capture the immense scale and serene, powerful atmosphere of the natural environment, focusing on the grandeur of the wilderness itself, rather than any single object within it.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, aerial, high-angle shot that moves forward and to the right, flying alongside a snow-covered mountain peak. A deep focus keeps the entire mountain landscape, from the foreground peak to the distant clouds, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video is a majestic aerial landscape scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain range. A prominent peak, blanketed with dense, snow-dusted evergreen trees, rises sharply in the foreground, its steep face descending towards a vast sea of white clouds that fills the valleys below. In the far distance, another range of jagged, snow-capped mountains is visible above the clouds under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the immense scale and serene, powerful atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the grandeur of the wilderness itself, rather than any single object within it.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a majestic, snow-covered mountain peak. The peak is covered with snow-dusted evergreen trees, and it rises above a sea of thick, white clouds. In the far distance, another range of snow-capped mountains is visible under a clear, light-blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a snow-covered mountain peak during the day. The peak and its slopes are covered in white snow and dense, snow-laden evergreen trees. A thick sea of white clouds sits in the valleys below and around the mountain, with the peaks of a more distant, rugged mountain range visible in the background under a clear blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
