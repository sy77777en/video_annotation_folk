  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a boy with short, dark hair and light skin, wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants, positioned in the center-left foreground of a dimly lit bedroom at night. The room is illuminated by two lamps casting a warm glow: one near a large bed with a dark wood headboard and white, rumpled bedding on the right side of the frame, and another near a cushioned single-person sofa in the bottom-left foreground. Light brown, floor-to-ceiling curtains are drawn closed along the back wall. The boy stands still, looking toward the large bed. The camera, at eye-level with a level-angle and deep focus, slightly unsteady, pans to the right as the boy turns to his right and runs quickly around the foot of the bed, moving from the center-left across the frame toward the right. As he moves further into the background, the shot transitions to a full shot, capturing his entire figure as he runs into a darker part of the room on the center-right side of the frame. The camera follows his movement, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot, as he continues beyond the bed and moves into the far right corner of the room.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus. The slightly unsteady camera pans to the right, following a young man as he runs toward the bed and continues beyond it, moving into the far right corner of the room.",
    "Subject": "A boy with short, dark hair and light skin, wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants, is seen in a dimly lit room. He initially stands still, looking towards a bed, before turning and running quickly around the foot of the bed into a darker area of the room.",
    "Motion": "A boy stands still in a dimly lit bedroom, looking toward a large bed. He then turns to his right and runs quickly around the foot of the bed, moving into a darker part of the room.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night. Two lamps cast a warm glow: one near the large bed with a dark wood headboard and white, rumpled bedding, and another near a cushioned single-person sofa. Light brown, floor-to-ceiling curtains are drawn closed along the back wall. A person wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants runs from the left side of the room, past the foot of the bed, and moves toward the right side of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a boy positioned in the center-left foreground. To his right, a large bed occupies the right side of the frame, with a cushioned chair in the bottom-left foreground and curtains lining the background. The boy turns and walks away from the camera, moving from the center-left across the frame toward the right. As he moves further into the background, the shot transitions to a full shot, capturing his entire figure as he walks around the foot of the bed and into the darkness on the center-right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
