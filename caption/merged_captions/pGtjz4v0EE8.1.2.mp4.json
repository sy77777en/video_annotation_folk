  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle scenery shot with no single main subject, capturing a bustling city square. The ornate facade of the Florence Cathedral occupies the top left and center of the frame in the background, showcasing its intricate polychrome marble design in white, green, and pink, with pointed arches, elaborate carvings, large bronze doors, and circular rose windows. To the right, a portion of another building displays a similar striped marble pattern of white and dark green, positioned in the middle ground. A column is visible in the foreground on the far left side of the frame at the end of the video. At the bottom of the frame, a public square filled with people lies in the middle ground, situated between the two buildings. The sun casts strong, dark shadows across the stone-paved square below, where numerous people are seen walking and congregating in front of the historic structures. The camera performs a quick and smooth pan to the left across the cathedral's facade, focusing on the cathedral's central entrance throughout the shot, and concludes with a rapid zoom out at the end. This time-lapse video shot from a high, overhead angle uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, capturing the dynamic view from a high vantage point. The piazza is covered in shadow, with crowds of people walking and gathering, conveying the impressive scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the historic location. The shot's purpose is to focus on the overall environment rather than a specific object, highlighting the magnificent, intricately detailed facade of the grand cathedral and the vibrant activity within the Piazza del Duomo in Florence on a bright, sunny day.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
