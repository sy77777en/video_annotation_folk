  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a blurry man with dark hair, wearing a dark tank top, lying on the ground in the center middle ground of a dimly lit indoor parking garage with a dark, concrete floor marked by a white painted line. The camera is fixed at a ground-level, level angle, using a shallow depth of field, with the focus initially set on the foreground, leaving the man out of focus. The scene is slightly unsteady, and the lighting is subdued, with some indistinct light sources visible further away. The man is struggling and moving his arms defensively after being compelled to the ground by another person. From off-screen, a woman's feet in shiny, silver, high-heeled sandals with ankle straps and thick heels walk into the frame, stopping in the foreground. The shot composition changes to a close-up of the feet, which are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right of the frame, with the sharp focus remaining on the foreground. The man remains out of focus in the center middle ground, now framed between the woman's heels. The focus then shifts to the woman stepping into the foreground, with only her feet and ankles visible in a close-up, as she appears to be standing to the side of the man.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a blurry man with dark hair, wearing a dark tank top, lying on the ground in the middle ground, trying to defend himself with both hands after being compelled to the ground by another person. The focus then shifts to a woman stepping into the foreground, with only her feet and ankles visible in a close-up. She is wearing shiny, silver, high-heeled sandals with ankle straps and thick heels, and she appears to be standing to the side of the man.",
    "Motion": "A man lies on the ground, struggling and moving his arms defensively. Initially, the scene appears blurred as nothing is in focus. A woman wearing high-heeled sandals walks into the foreground, which is in sharp focus, and stops near the man.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor parking garage with a dark, concrete floor marked by a white painted line. From a level perspective, a pair of silver, metallic high-heeled sandals with thin ankle straps walks into the foreground and stops, framing a view of a blurred figure lying on the ground in the middle ground. The lighting is subdued, with some indistinct light sources visible further away.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a blurry man lying on the ground in the center middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
