  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot capturing a traditional Japanese street from a first-person perspective. Initially, a large wooden structure with a tiled roof dominates the top and right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, with a red fence in the bottom right foreground. The wooden beams are dark and weathered, adding a sense of history. On the left, a sidewalk and trees are visible. The camera captures a street view from an eye-level perspective, maintaining a level angle. It moves forward along the street, with a midway pan to the left to align with its direction of motion. As the camera moves left, more of the building's structure and the surrounding environment come into view, including a pathway lined with greenery and additional buildings in the background. The camera continues to pan left, revealing a long, straight street lined with traditional buildings located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, extending from the left foreground into the background, and a sidewalk bordered by green bushes that stretches from the bottom foreground into the background. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, and employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The scene unfolds during the day, under clear blue skies, with sunlight casting distinct shadows. A sign indicating 'No Smoking' is visible next to the building, and a wooden fence surrounds the area. The overall atmosphere is serene and picturesque, with a harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements, emphasizing the atmosphere and setting rather than a specific object. The focus is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, conveying a sense of tranquility and cultural heritage.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
