  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a scenic landscape from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, a rocky, green hillside spans the bottom of the frame, with white and grey rocks prominently visible. The historic walled city on a peninsula occupies the center of the middle ground, with a small harbor on its left. A white cable car structure is situated in the foreground, positioned behind some white and grey rocks that fill the bottom of the frame. The sea surrounds the city and fills the top portion of the frame, serving as the background, where a small, green island is located in the top left. A text overlay is visible in the top left corner. This is a scenic, stationary shot from a high vantage point. It captures a panoramic view of a historic walled city with red-tiled roofs, situated on a peninsula surrounded by the deep blue sea. The perspective is from a rocky, green hillside, with a small, tree-covered island visible in the distance. From a high angle, this deep-focus shot captures the coastal city and the sea, keeping both the foreground rocks and the distant island in sharp detail. The camera performs a smooth, minor upward tilt. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with distinctive orange-red terracotta roofs, entirely encircled by thick, light-gray stone fortifications. A small harbor with docked boats is nestled along the city walls. To the right, a white tower stands, which could be either a utility tower or a cable car support tower, with a red section painted on it. The warm light suggests either early morning or late afternoon. An overlay in the top-left corner contains the text \"Xscion.org\" and \"COPYRIGHT\".",

    "Subject": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape and seascape scenery shot, offering a high-angle, sweeping view of a historic coastal city. The city, distinguished by its dense collection of terracotta-roofed buildings, is entirely enclosed by formidable stone walls and situated on a peninsula that extends into the deep blue sea, with a small, verdant island visible in the background. The shot is taken from a rocky, green hillside in the foreground, which includes part of a cable car structure, enhancing the sense of elevation. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the location, focusing on the relationship between the ancient architecture and its stunning natural surroundings rather than any single element.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
