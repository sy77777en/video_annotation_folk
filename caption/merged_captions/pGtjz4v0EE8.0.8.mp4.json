  "merged_caption": "This video captures a scenic view of a Venetian canal from a high-angle perspective, presenting a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. The scene opens with an extreme wide shot where historic buildings line the top, left, and right sides of the frame, situated in the middle ground and background. The canal itself occupies the bottom and center, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The murky green water of the Grand Canal is filled with activity, featuring a white and yellow vaporetto (water bus) moving through the center, alongside several traditional black gondolas, some being rowed and others docked. Lining the canal are rows of classic Venetian buildings, characterized by their aged, multi-story facades in shades of tan, yellow, and off-white, topped with reddish-brown tiled roofs, creating a dense and picturesque architectural landscape. The scene is brightly lit with a warm, yellowish tint and a slightly hazy, high-contrast quality. A white water bus travels from the center left to the right, eventually exiting the frame, while various gondolas are positioned: one is in the foreground at the bottom left, another is in the middle ground to the left, and several are docked along the left bank. This time-lapse video is captured from an overhead, second-floor height. The shot begins at a high angle with bands of blurring on both sides of the frame. The camera then performs a quick, smooth movement, first zooming in, then suddenly zooming in further toward the upper left while simultaneously tilting up and panning left. This motion shifts the view to a level angle before the camera becomes static. As the camera slowly zooms in, the gondolas become more visible, and the scene reframes into a wide shot that brings the buildings and boat activity in the middle ground into a tighter, more focused composition.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the historic city rather than a specific main subject, capturing the scale and unique character of the location.

    "Motion": "This scenic video captures the dynamic activity on the bustling Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. Historic buildings line the greenish waterway, which is filled with various boats, including white and yellow vaporettos (water buses) moving through the center. Several traditional black gondolas can be seen, some being rowed while others are docked, adding to the lively atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime scene captures a wide canal in Venice, Italy, lined on both sides with historic, multi-story buildings featuring terracotta tile roofs and aged facades in shades of yellow and beige. The greenish water of the canal is active with boat traffic, including a white water bus moving through the center and several black gondolas, some with passengers, navigating the waterway. Other boats are moored along wooden docks at the canal's edge. The scene is brightly lit with a warm, yellowish tint and a slightly hazy, high-contrast quality.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
