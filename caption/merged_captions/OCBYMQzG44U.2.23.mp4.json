  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot captured from a low-angle perspective at water level, depicting an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling a flooded indoor pool or corridor. The murky water occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. A tiled wall fills the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The ceiling, featuring a row of square, recessed lights, is visible at the top of the frame, receding toward the back. In the background, positioned in the center-right, a short flight of wide, white stairs leads up to an open doorway, offering a glimpse into a brighter, hazy area beyond. The camera is positioned just above the water's surface, exhibiting mild barrel distortion, and begins at a low angle. It executes a quick, smooth pan to the left while tilting down, settling into a level perspective. A deep focus keeps the entire tiled room in sharp detail. The camera bobs slightly, while gentle ripples naturally form in the dark water that fills the lower half of the sterile, tiled environment. The camera pans to the left, revealing a tiled wall with a hole in the center in the middle ground. This hole appears to be a passageway partially submerged in water, extending into darkness. The murky water continues to fill the foreground throughout the shot. The left wall appears curved due to barrel distortion from the camera and is covered in a grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles that reflect the light from the series of recessed square fixtures in the ceiling. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a camera positioned just above the water's surface, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera begins at a low angle and executes a quick, smooth pan to the left while tilting down, settling into a level perspective. A deep focus keeps the entire tiled room in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling a flooded indoor pool or corridor. The camera is positioned at water level, looking down a long, narrow hall with walls covered in small, pale green tiles that curve up to a flat ceiling. A series of square, recessed lights illuminates the scene with a sterile, even glow, reflecting off the tiled surfaces and the murky, rippling water that covers the floor. At the far end, a short flight of white stairs leads up to an open doorway, offering a glimpse into a brighter, hazy area beyond. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange architecture and the feeling of isolation rather than any specific object or character.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a long, tiled room or hallway partially filled with murky water. The walls are covered in small, light-green tiles, and the ceiling features a series of square lights. At the far end of the space, a doorway is visible at the top of a short flight of stairs.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is positioned at the surface of murky water within a long, narrow, and artificially lit indoor space. The left wall appears curved due to barrel distortion from the camera and is covered in a grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles that reflect the light from a series of recessed square fixtures in the ceiling. At the far end of the room, a set of wide, white stairs leads up to an open doorway. The camera bobs slightly, while gentle ripples naturally form in the dark water that fills the lower half of the sterile, tiled environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
