  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the shot looks down at a person's hands and torso, which are located in the bottom part of the frame, in the foreground. The person's legs and feet extend into the middle ground, where they are standing on a concrete surface to construct a brick wall. In the center foreground, their hands, covered in wet, grey mortar, are shown pressing a rectangular, reddish-orange brick into a horizontal row of similar bricks held together by the mortar. The person wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark shorts with a repeating yellow and pinkish circular pattern, and a black watch or band on the right wrist. A white guide string lies in loops on a set of concrete stairs just in front of the bricks. A green plastic basin with more wet mortar and a small trowel with an orange handle is positioned in the bottom-left middle ground. The background, visible at the top of the frame, consists of a lower level with a coiled black hose in the top-left and a concrete ledge in the top-right, along with green vegetation and rocks. This unsteady, first-person point-of-view shot begins with a slight upside-down high-angle view of a person's hands laying bricks. As the person stands up, the camera moves upward with a slight counterclockwise roll, transitioning to a bird's-eye view of the construction site. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The person's left hand rests on a newly positioned brick on the wall, then is removed as the person straightens up and slightly turns to the left. The scene takes place outdoors during the day on the second floor, on a patch of uneven dirt ground.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying a course of rectangular, reddish-orange bricks. His hands and forearms are covered in wet, grey mortar. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and dark shorts with a repeating yellow and pinkish circular pattern. A black watch or band is visible on his right wrist. The rough-textured bricks are being set in a line on a bed of the grey mortar. To his left, a green plastic basin contains more of the wet mortar and a small trowel with an orange handle.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down at a construction task taking place outdoors during the day on the second floor. On a patch of uneven dirt ground, a person's hands press a rectangular, red-orange brick into a line of similar bricks held together by wet, dark gray mortar. A white string rests on the stairs on the right side of the frame. The person's legs, clad in patterned shorts, are visible at the bottom of the view. Nearby, a green plastic bucket contains more mortar, and in the background, green vegetation and rocks are visible near a concrete ledge, along with a coiled black hose and other construction debris.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
