  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot from inside a dark, reddish-brown water slide tube, with the circular exit positioned at the center and in the middle ground of the frame. The camera is at the same height as the slide’s interior, emphasizing the enclosed space. The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera begins at eye level with a high angle, looking down, and then slides downward while moving forward. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions to a wide shot, emerging from the slide’s exit into a large, open pool room. In this wide shot, the pool occupies the lower part of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while the white tiled walls are positioned in the background and the metal railing is in the middle ground, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. The open doorway is visible in the background, slightly left of center, and the camera remains at a low height, close to the water’s surface, maintaining a first-person perspective throughout the movement. As it approaches the pool, the camera tilts up and transitions to a level angle above the water. The movement is very smooth and steady, with no shaking. Deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The pool is surrounded by white tiled walls and flooring, with a metal handrail leading into the water. The water’s surface is calm, reflecting the bright overhead lighting, and the environment is clean and minimalistic. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through circular windows, contributing to the sense of depth and openness in the setting.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an interior scenery shot that transitions from an enclosed space to an open one. The focus is on the environment and the unsettling atmosphere it creates, rather than on a specific subject, an effect heightened by the first-person perspective. The sequence begins inside a dark, reddish-brown, enclosed water slide tube, looking toward a small circle of light. It then emerges from the slide's red-rimmed exit into a starkly lit, institutional-looking pool room. The room features white tiled walls, a pool of murky greenish water, and a simple metal railing in the middle ground, all contributing to a sense of eerie emptiness.",
    "Motion": "The video transitions from a close-up view inside a dark, curved tunnel or tube to a serene indoor pool scene with calm water and minimalistic white walls. The subject's motion is not the focus; the shots emphasize the atmosphere and environment.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves from the inside of a smooth, red, funnel-shaped structure with a matte surface and gentle curves, transitioning into a large, indoor swimming pool area. The pool is surrounded by white tiled walls and flooring, with a metal handrail leading into the water. The water’s surface is calm, reflecting the bright overhead lighting, and the environment is clean and minimalistic. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through circular windows, and an open doorway is visible in the background, contributing to the sense of depth and openness in the setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
