  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man's left hand gripping the steering wheel, positioned in the left and center of the frame and occupying the foreground, while the dashboard with illuminated gauges and a digital clock reading 5:23 is visible in the middle ground on the right. The camera is at the same height as the hand, level with the steering wheel. The shot then transitions to a close-up of the driver’s face, featuring a neatly trimmed beard and a dark hat, now centered in the frame and in the foreground, with the side window and the dark night outside visible in the background. The camera tilts up and pans left, maintaining a close-up shot as it shifts focus to a second man with slightly darker skin and very short hair, holding a large black rifle with both hands. He is positioned slightly left of center in the frame, behind a metal barrier, wearing a dark tactical outfit. As the camera focuses on him, he raises the gun, which becomes the central focus in the foreground, with his face positioned behind it. The metal partition and vehicle interior, featuring dark upholstery and a grid-patterned security partition, remain in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject’s eye level throughout, smoothly moving from the driver to the armed person, and the subtitle text appears at the bottom of the frame, overlaying the scene with dialogue: \"Price: Hey...\", \"Price: There's a checkpoint.\" \"Kyle: For us?\", and “Price: What- is there a difference?” The entire movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all characters clear. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and subtle reflections from the dashboard lights.",

    "Camera": "This shot is filmed from the eye-level perspective of a front passenger. The camera maintains a level angle as it tilts up and pans left to focus on the driver's face.

    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up of a man's left hand gripping a steering wheel, showing a light skin tone and wearing a dark, long-sleeved jacket. The camera then transitions to reveal the driver's face, featuring a neatly trimmed beard and a dark hat. It pans left to focus on another man with slightly darker skin and very short hair, who is holding a large black rifle with both hands. He is wearing a dark tactical outfit and is positioned behind a metal barrier, looking intently through the weapon’s sights. The camera moves smoothly from the driver to the armed person, highlighting their distinct roles and appearances.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a man gripping a steering wheel with his left hand while driving and speaking. The camera then shifts to another man positioned behind a metal barrier, who speaks before holding a large rifle with both hands and looking through the weapon’s sights, remaining focused and stationary as he aims.",
    "Scene": "The video is set inside a vehicle at night, with the the dashboard’s soft blue and red lights, which provide minimal illumination. The dashboard displays illuminated gauges and a digital clock reading 5:23, while the windshield reveals a dark, indistinct outdoor environment. The vehicle’s interior features dark upholstery and a metal security partition with a grid pattern separating the front and back seats. A person in the back seat is visible holding a black rifle with a matte finish and textured grip, positioned near the partition. The scene includes green and white subtitle text near the bottom center with the dialogue: \"Price: Hey...\", \"Price: There's a checkpoint.\" \"Kyle: For us?\", and “Price: What- is there a difference?” The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and subtle reflections from the dashboard lights.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
