  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a video game scene captured from an isometric perspective. An abstract, yellow, maze-like structure is prominently featured in the middle and upper portions of the frame, set against a solid black background. The environment consists of pixelated cubes forming a maze-like series of stairs, platforms, and archways in an Escher-esque configuration. A yellow, cat-like creature, rendered entirely in yellow pixel art, is initially positioned slightly below the center on the left side of the structure. The creature moves from behind an archway, turns right, and approaches a staircase. It then hops twice, landing on the second step of the isometric staircase, before turning to face left. The camera remains stationary throughout the video. At the bottom of the screen, a user interface is displayed with yellow, scroll-like borders. On the left, an icon of a person is next to the number \"04\". In the center, the word \"DAY\" is displayed in purple pixelated text, with the number '00' in white on a black background below it. On the right, a red ornate frame contains a white circular object with a face-like design.",

    "Subject": "A stylized, cat-like creature, rendered entirely in yellow pixel art, is situated within an isometric, maze-like structure also made of yellow blocks on a black background. The structure features staircases and arches arranged in an impossible, Escher-esque configuration. At the bottom of the screen, a user interface is displayed, featuring a white stick figure icon next to the number \"04\" on the left. In the center, a purple symbol labeled 'Day' is shown, with the number '00' displayed in white on a black background below it. To the right, a red-bordered square contains a white circular object that resembles a human face. Additionally, yellow scroll-like drawings are symmetrically distributed on both sides at the bottom of the frame.",
    "Motion": "The yellow, cat-like creature moves behind the archway, turns right, and approaches the steps. It then hops twice, landing on the second step of the isometric staircase, before turning left again.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is a retro, pixelated video game level set against a solid black background. The environment consists of an abstract architectural structure made entirely of yellow, pixelated cubes, forming a maze-like series of stairs, platforms, and archways. A yellow, cat-like character moves behind the archway, turns right, and proceeds toward the steps. It then jumps twice, landing on the second step of the staircase, before turning left again. The bottom of the screen features a user interface overlay with yellow, scroll-like borders. On the left, an icon of a person is next to the number \"04\". In the center, the word \"DAY\" is displayed in purple pixelated text. On the right, a red ornate frame contains a white circular object with a face-like design.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of a video game scene captured from an isometric perspective. An abstract, yellow, maze-like structure is prominently featured in the middle and upper portions of the frame. A user interface is displayed across the bottom of the screen, with icons and text at the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. A yellow, cat-like creature is initially positioned slightly below the center on the left side of the structure. It moves from behind an archway, turns right, and proceeds toward a staircase. The creature then jumps up two steps before turning to face left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
