  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot filmed from a locked-on perspective at the subjects' level, the front of a yellow taxi occupies the foreground. The driver, a Black man with glasses and a dark shirt, is positioned in the middle ground, visible through the windshield in the center-right of the frame, while a woman with dark hair and a dark top is seated in the middle ground to the center-left, partially obscured. Her reflection is also visible in the partition between the front and back seats. The camera, mounted on the front of the taxi, moves backward, lead-tracking the driver and the vehicle from a slightly unsteady, eye-level, and level perspective. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. As the taxi drives forward at night, the driver steers the vehicle, keeping his hands on the steering wheel as the car moves along a road. The background features a large, brightly lit building with a curved roof visible on the right side of the frame, across a highway with moving traffic. As the taxi moves forward, the background building shifts laterally toward the right edge of the frame, while the subjects inside the car maintain their positions relative to the camera. The taxi's roof sign is illuminated, displaying the word 'TAXI' in uppercase white letters. The entire scene is cast in a dim, yellowish light, with illuminated buildings and highway lights passing by in the background.",

    "Subject": "A Black man with glasses and a dark shirt is seen from the front, driving a yellow taxi at night with his hands on the steering wheel. In the back seat, a woman with dark hair and a dark top is partially visible, sitting behind the driver. Her reflection is also visible in the partition between the front and back seats.",
    "Motion": "A yellow taxi drives forward at night, as seen from a perspective outside looking inside through the front windshield. The driver steers the vehicle, keeping his hands on the steering wheel as the car moves along a road with illuminated buildings and highway lights passing by in the background.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeps the perspective fixed on the front of a yellow taxi driving at night. The taxi's roof sign is illuminated, displaying the word 'TAXI' in uppercase white letters. Through the windshield, the dark interior of the car shows a driver behind the wheel and a passenger. In the background, a large, brightly lit building with a curved roof is visible across a highway with moving traffic. The entire scene is cast in a dim, yellowish light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
