  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot from a first-person perspective, capturing a spacious and verdant zoo or park during the daytime. Initially, a wooden boardwalk with metal railings is positioned in the center right foreground and middle ground, leading toward a paved path in the right middle ground. The park is filled with lush, green trees and planters bordered by rough stones. An animal enclosure with large rock formations occupies the left middle ground, with a tan-colored building behind it in the background. The camera moves forward with a slight shake, gradually panning smoothly to the right, causing the boardwalk to move out of the frame. This movement reveals more of the park's pleasant, naturalistic environment, including a new animal enclosure with a metal fence in the right middle ground, containing several deer in a dirt-floored area with a simple shelter. The view settles on the paved path, which now runs from the bottom center toward the right, backed by another building and dense green trees in the background. The sky is overcast, and a few other visitors are seen walking along the paths. Throughout the pan, the camera maintains a consistent eye-level height, simulating a walk through the park. Towards the end, it stops panning and continues moving straight ahead, keeping the entire scene sharp with deep focus, emphasizing the scale and design of the park rather than singling out any of the few visitors strolling through the area as a primary subject.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera moves forward with a slight shake, gradually panning to the right to follow the path. Towards the end, it stops panning and continues moving straight ahead.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a scenery shot of a spacious and verdant zoo or park. The camera pans across a landscape featuring a combination of wooden boardwalks and wide, paved paths that wind through numerous leafy green trees and planters edged with natural stone. The animal enclosures are integrated into the environment with large, artificial rock formations and simple metal fences. The focus remains on the overall environment and its peaceful atmosphere, as the camera's sweeping movement captures the scale and design of the park rather than singling out any of the few visitors strolling through the area as a primary subject.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a scenic view of a pathway in a zoo or park, featuring lush green trees, rock formations, and animal enclosures in the middle ground. The camera pans to the right, revealing more of the park's pleasant, naturalistic environment.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an outdoor zoo or wildlife park during the daytime. The path transitions from a wooden boardwalk with metal railings to a wider, light-colored paved area. The park is filled with lush, green trees and planters bordered by rough stones. On the left, an animal enclosure features large, artificial rock formations and a tan-colored building. As the view pans right, another enclosure comes into view, fenced with metal railings, containing several deer in a dirt-floored area with a simple shelter. The sky is overcast, and a few other visitors are seen walking along the paths.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
