  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate labeled \"Jazz\" is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while the \"COFFEE\" plate is on the right, also in the middle ground. Both plates are at the same level as the camera, which is positioned at their height. The ocean forms the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame, with gentle waves continuously moving towards the shore. The pebbles surrounding the plates fill the lower part of the frame, creating a textured foreground. The overall composition remains constant, emphasizing the juxtaposition of the plates against the natural coastal backdrop. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the midground where the license plates are located. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the plates sharp while the background is blurred. The camera remains completely static. The video shows two license plates, one white with the word 'Jazz' and a musical note symbol, and the other black with the word 'COFFEE,' partially buried in pebbles on a beach. The ocean waves are seen crashing in the background, creating a dynamic and lively scene. The video features two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate on the left is white with a blue border and displays the word \"Jazz\" in bold black letters, accompanied by a musical note symbol. The plate on the right is black with white lettering, displaying the word \"COFFEE.\" Both plates are partially embedded in the pebbles, with the ocean visible in the background. The scene suggests a playful juxtaposition of themes, combining music and coffee in a coastal setting.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor beach setting with a focus on two license plate-style signs partially buried in pebbly sand. The signs, one white with blue trim and the word \"Jazz,\" and the other black with the word \"Coffee,\" are positioned prominently in the midground. The background features a calm body of water, likely the ocean, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the area, highlighting the texture of the sand and the smooth surface of the water. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the signs adding a quirky, artistic element to the natural coastal environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate labeled \"Jazz\" is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while the \"COFFEE\" plate is on the right, also in the middle ground. Both plates are at the same level as the camera, which is positioned at their height. The ocean forms the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame, with gentle waves continuously moving towards the shore. There are no significant changes in the spatial positioning of the plates or the camera throughout the video; the plates remain static, and the camera maintains a steady angle, capturing the consistent motion of the waves in the background. The pebbles surrounding the plates fill the lower part of the frame, creating a textured foreground. The overall composition remains constant, emphasizing the juxtaposition of the plates against the natural coastal backdrop."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
