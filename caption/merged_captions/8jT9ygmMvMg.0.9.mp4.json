  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the scenery, captured from a level-angle, aerial perspective. The shot begins with the Column of the Lion of Venice in the left foreground and the Doge's Palace extending behind it into the left middle ground. The waterfront promenade is in the center, with the Venetian Lagoon and moored gondolas on the right and the sunrise in the right background. The camera, in a very smooth aerial drone shot, trucks right while panning left, maintaining a level angle throughout the shot, before subtly drifting up and to the right to reveal the full expanse of the square and surrounding buildings. The camera then performs a sweeping, upward arc, pulling back while circling the column. This motion reframes the composition, ending with the column in the center foreground, the Doge's Palace in the center middle ground, and the entirety of St. Mark's Square occupying the foreground and middle ground. The warm, golden light of the rising sun illuminates the historic architecture and reflects off the calm water of the Venetian Lagoon. Towards the end of the video, a tall rectangular building with a red body and white top becomes visible in the background. The camera maintains its level-angle position above the square throughout the shot. The vast, paved square below is sparsely populated with pedestrians, while a crowd gathers in St. Mark's Square, adding life to the scene. The camera moves to provide sweeping, panoramic views of the historic location and the adjacent waterfront with moored gondolas. The scene captures the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the environment, with mild barrel distortion and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
