  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a leopard with a tawny, spotted coat, whose body occupies the left and center of the frame. The leopard is positioned in the middle ground, lying curled on a bed of rough, brown rocks that extend from the middle ground into the background. Its head, covered in black rosettes with white fur around its mouth and under its chin, is in the center of the frame, bent down towards its white front paw. The leopard actively grooms itself, repeatedly extending its pink tongue to lick the paw in a steady motion while its body remains still. In the bottom right foreground, a small green plant is visible. The setting is a natural, outdoor environment, and the camera remains static, positioned at the leopard's level, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the leopard in the midground, with only minor, smooth movements.",

    "Camera": "This level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a leopard in the midground. The camera remains relatively still, exhibiting only minor, smooth movements.",
    "Subject": "A leopard with a tawny, spotted coat is shown in a close-up view, lying down on a rocky surface. The animal's body is curled as it actively grooms itself, with its head bent down to lick its white front paw. Its pink tongue is visible during the action. The leopard's fur is covered in black rosettes, and the fur around its mouth and under its chin is white.",
    "Motion": "A leopard lies curled on a rocky surface, grooming its front paw. It repeatedly extends its pink tongue, licking the paw in a steady motion while its body remains still.",
    "Scene": "A leopard with a yellowish-tan coat marked with black spots lies curled on a bed of rough, brown rocks. The setting is a natural, outdoor environment, with the rocky terrain extending into the background. The animal is captured in a close-up view as it grooms, extending its pink tongue to lick a paw. A small, leafy green plant is visible at the edge of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
