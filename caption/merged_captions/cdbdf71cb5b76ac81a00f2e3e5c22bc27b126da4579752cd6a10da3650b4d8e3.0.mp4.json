  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a serene seascape, capturing a pebble-strewn beach in the foreground, stretching across the bottom of the frame. The ocean occupies the middle ground, extending to the horizon in the background, which is positioned near the top of the frame under a clear sky. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the pebbles in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains completely static, maintaining a stable view of the tranquil setting. The scene captures a tranquil beach setting during the daytime, with clear blue skies and calm ocean waves gently lapping against a pebbled shoreline. The pebbles are varied in color, ranging from earthy browns to muted reds, and have a smooth, rounded texture. The ocean extends to the horizon, its surface a deep blue with subtle ripples. As the video progresses, three boats appear in succession, moving from left to right across the background, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The focus remains on the natural environment, emphasizing the rhythmic motion of the waves and the expansive scale of the sea. The horizon stretches endlessly under a clear sky, creating a sense of openness and calm. The boats enhance the atmosphere of peacefulness and continuity, highlighting the beauty of the natural world. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural elements of the sea and sky dominating the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
