  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot showing Tom, an animated anthropomorphic cat with blue fur, a light blue chest, white parts on its face and hands, large yellow eyes, a small black nose, and prominent pink inner ears, leaping off the bed on the right side of the frame. The bed extends from the middle ground to the background, with nightstands occupying the center and right background. A white table with a porcelain-like surface and a delicate green vase filled with white flowers, along with a striped chair, are in the bottom left foreground. The patterned beige carpet covers the foreground, and the headboard and lamps are in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle, looking down at Tom, before smoothly transitioning to a level angle as it moves. Tom hops down from the bed, tiptoeing with his body hunched and his hands tucked close to his chest, clutching a white bundle in his left hand. He moves from the left middle ground toward the center, passing the table and approaching the window. The camera continuously moves backward in a smooth, steady lead tracking shot, keeping Tom in sharp focus while the real-world bedroom environment remains in shallow focus. The camera then transitions to a medium shot, centering Tom in the frame and bringing him into the foreground as he stands in front of the window, which has a circular cut-out and its frame now prominent in the foreground. Tom props himself up, bounces onto a stool, then throws the bundle out the window with a sweeping motion and quickly pinches his fingertips together to close the round gap in the glass. Throughout, the camera remains at Tom’s height, with the spatial focus moving from the wider room to a tighter view of Tom and the window.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle, looking down at Tom Cat, before smoothly transitioning to a level angle as it moves. The camera continuously moves backward in a smooth, steady lead tracking shot, keeping Tom Cat in sharp focus while the real-world bedroom environment remains in shallow focus, with the focus shifting from the background to the foreground. As the camera leads Tom Cat, it slightly tilts down and then up to maintain orientation, and Tom Cat becomes larger in the frame during the tracking movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic cat with blue fur, a light blue chest, and white parts on its face and hands. It has large yellow eyes, a small black nose, and prominent pink inner ears. The cat's tail is blue with a small white tip. It is depicted with exaggerated, expressive gestures, including moments with arms raised and mouth open. The cat is also shown standing upright, facing forward, with its white-furred hands pressed against a transparent surface. Its facial expressions and body language are highly animated, emphasizing its cartoonish and lively appearance. No other subjects are present in the video.",
    "Motion": "Tom hops down from the bed, tiptoeing with his body hunched and his hands tucked close to his chest, clutching a white bundle in his left hand. He moves forward from the left side of the bed, veering slightly left to arrive at the front of the bed near the center-left of the frame, before proceeding straight to the table. Using his right hand to support himself, Tom bounces onto a stool, then throws the bundle out the window with a sweeping motion and quickly pinches his fingertips together to close the round gap in the glass.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a well-lit, modern bedroom featuring a large bed with a textured dark green blanket, white pillows, and a beige upholstered headboard. On either side of the bed, there are nightstands, each with a white table lamp. The left nightstand holds a small wine barrel with a bottle of wine inside and two goblets beside it. In the foreground on the left side of the frame, there is a white table with a porcelain-like surface, featuring a delicate green vase filled with white flowers. Next to the table is a black-and-white striped chair, with only the backrest visible. The floor is covered with a patterned beige carpet. As the camera pulls back, a window is revealed with a circular section cut out of its glass, bordered by deep brown wooden frames. The environment is tidy and organized, with soft, neutral tones dominating the decor. An animated blue and gray cat with white markings and pink ears, named Tom, moves through the scene. Tom flings a white bundle through the round hole in the window and then cleverly replaces the circular glass piece, sealing the pane seamlessly. The video combines live-action elements with animation.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a wide shot showing Tom, the animated cat, leaping off the bed on the right side of the frame, which extends from the middle ground to the background, with the nightstands occupying the center and right background. A white table with a vase and a striped chair are in the bottom left foreground. The patterned carpet covers the foreground, and the headboard and lamps are in the background. As Tom tiptoes forward in a crouched posture, he moves from the left middle ground toward the center, passing the table and approaching the window. The camera then transitions to a medium shot, centering Tom in the frame and bringing him into the foreground as he stands in front of the window. The window, with a circular cut-out and its frame, is now prominent in the foreground, as the camera films through it, while the table and vase are visible in the left middle ground. Tom props himself up, bounces onto a stool (not fully visible), and flings the white bundle through the window, then pinches the glass to seal it. Throughout, the camera remains at Tom’s height, with the spatial focus moving from the wider room to a tighter view of Tom and the window."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
