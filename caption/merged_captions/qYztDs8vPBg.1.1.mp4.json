  "merged_caption": "In a static, close-up shot, a pair of light-skinned hands is centered in the foreground, holding a gold-colored wristwatch and a black electronic device labeled \"DIAMOND SELECTOR II\" over a white surface. The watch, with a round, gold-colored face and a textured gold band, is partially supported by a clear plastic stand. The left hand, wearing a gold ring, steadies the watch, while the right hand presses the pointed tip of the device against the watch's crystal. As contact is made, the indicator lights on the tester illuminate in rapid succession from left to right, filling the entire scale and reaching the red section. The hands remain mostly still, with subtle movements to adjust the angle of the watch for accurate contact with the diamond tester. In the background, a vertically oriented smartphone with its camera app open is in the top-left, with an orange BIC lighter positioned below it and a row of colored pencils to its left. In the top-center background, a white rectangular object with the text \"JerryRigEverything\" is visible, while a small screwdriver with a blue and silver handle rests on the right. The camera captures this scene from a static, bird's-eye view, overhead POV shot with a deep depth of field, employing a deep focus that makes the entire scene sharp and clear.",

    "Subject": "A man's light-skinned hands hold a gold-colored wristwatch and a black electronic device over a white surface. The left hand, wearing a gold ring, steadies the watch, which has a round, gold-colored face with the brand name \"TISSOT\" and a textured gold band. The right hand presses the pointed tip of a black handheld device, labeled \"DIAMOND SELECTOR II,\" against the watch's crystal. The device's indicator lights are fully illuminated up to the red section. To the left of the hands, a black smartphone is positioned vertically with its camera app open, next to an orange BIC lighter and a row of colored pencils. In the background, a white rectangular object with the text \"JerryRigEverything\" is visible, and a small screwdriver with a blue and silver handle lies on the right.",
    "Motion": "A person's right hand presses the tip of a diamond tester against the face of a gold watch, which is held steady by the left hand. As contact is made, the indicator lights on the tester illuminate in rapid succession from left to right, filling the entire scale and reaching the red section. While the hands remain mostly still, there are subtle movements to adjust the angle of the watch for accurate contact with the diamond tester.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, captures a scene on a white tabletop. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored watch with a textured band against a black electronic device labeled \"DIAMOND SELECTOR II.\" The tip of the device touches the watch face, and a row of LED lights on its scale illuminates. The tabletop is also occupied by a smartphone with its camera app open, an orange lighter, a set of colorful tools, a small screwdriver, and a white and black tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it. The watch is partially supported by a clear plastic stand.",
    "Spatial": "In a static, close-up shot, a pair of hands is centered in the foreground, holding a gold-colored watch and a black electronic device over a white surface. The watch is held partially over a clear plastic stand. In the background, a vertically oriented smartphone is in the top-left, with an orange lighter positioned below it and colored pencils to its left. In the top-center background, a white tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it is visible, while a screwdriver rests on the right. The right hand presses the tip of the electronic device against the watch face, causing the device's indicator lights to progressively illuminate from green to red. The camera is above the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
