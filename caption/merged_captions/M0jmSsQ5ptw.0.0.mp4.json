  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in the center foreground, framed by the interior of an aircraft on the top, left, and right. He wears a white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding on the chest and sleeves, over which he has a black parachute harness. On his head, he wears a yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top, along with white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor. The landscape and clouds are visible in the background. The man stands in the open doorway of the aircraft, facing the camera and holding onto the frame with his right hand. His left hand changes gestures counting down three, two, one. The shot begins with a still camera at a level angle, which has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. He then jumps backward out of the aircraft, spreading his arms to his sides as he begins to freefall through the sky. The camera then moves slightly forward and tilts down smoothly to track the skydiver as he jumps, causing the camera angle to shift to a high angle. The shot transitions to an extreme wide shot captured from a high angle, looking down at him. In this new framing, the man is a smaller figure in the center middle ground, with his arms outstretched, set against the vast background of the ground far below and clouds scattered across the sky. From high above the ground, a skydiver exits an aircraft into a bright, sunny sky filled with large, white, puffy clouds. Below, a sprawling landscape unfolds, marked by a grid of roads and buildings interspersed with patches of brown and green terrain. In the distance, a body of water is visible on the horizon under the clear blue sky.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from an aerial-level perspective with a deep focus, keeping both the subject and the distant ground sharp. The shot begins with a still camera at a level angle, which has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera then moves slightly forward and tilts down smoothly to track the skydiver as he jumps, causing the camera angle to shift to a high angle. During this tracking shot, the skydiver becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A man is shown preparing to skydive from an aircraft. He wears a white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding on the chest and sleeves, over which he has a black parachute harness. On his head, he wears a yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top. He also wears white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor. Initially, he is inside the aircraft, holding onto the door frame and looking at the camera. He then jumps out, extending his arms to his sides in a stable freefall position.",
    "Motion": "A man stands in the open doorway of an aircraft, facing the camera and holding onto the frame with his right hand. His left hand changes gestures counting down three, two, one, and then jumps backward out of the aircraft, spreading his arms to his sides as he begins to freefall through the sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
