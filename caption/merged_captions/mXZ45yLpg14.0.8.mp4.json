  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures three figures from behind, with the main subject in a red protective suit positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. This central figure is flanked by two other individuals in dark tactical gear, located to the left and right and slightly ahead, also in the middle ground. The group walks steadily away from the camera, moving deeper into the background of a dense, dark forest shrouded in thick gray fog. The environment features tall, bare tree trunks and a muddy, uneven ground scattered with fallen branches. The lighting is dim and diffuse, creating a desaturated scene dominated by shades of gray and black. The main subject wears a full-body, red protective suit, along with black gloves and black boots, and is equipped with a silver-colored breathing apparatus consisting of two large vertical tanks with yellow markings. The two accompanying figures are dressed in dark, possibly black or dark green, tactical uniforms with helmets and are each carrying a rifle. The camera remains at the subjects' level as they proceed forward, with noticeable unsteady movement and some shaking. A deep focus keeps both the figures and the surrounding environment in view, enhancing the sense of depth as large tree trunks are visible in the middle ground, while more trees populate the further middle ground and fade into the background. The group moves in a loose formation, advancing slowly and deliberately through the foggy forest, with the camera following their progression from behind, capturing the scene's evolving dynamics as they navigate the uneven, muddy terrain.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot follows a group of three people from behind as they move forward through a dark forest. The camera movement is noticeably unsteady, with some shaking. A deep focus keeps both the figures and the surrounding environment in view.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a person seen from behind, walking away from the viewer. This individual is wearing a full-body, red protective suit, along with black gloves and black boots. Strapped to their back is a silver-colored breathing apparatus consisting of two large vertical tanks with yellow markings. Accompanying this person are two other individuals, positioned to the left and right in front of them, who are also walking away from the viewer. These two figures are dressed in dark, possibly black or dark green, tactical uniforms with helmets and are each carrying a rifle.",
    "Motion": "A person in a red protective suit, flanked by two individuals in dark tactical gear, walks steadily away from the camera. The group moves in a loose formation, advancing slowly and deliberately through a dark, foggy forest with uneven, muddy terrain.",
    "Scene": "Three figures navigate through a dense, dark forest shrouded in thick gray fog. The environment features tall, bare tree trunks and a muddy, uneven ground scattered with fallen branches. The lighting is dim and diffuse, creating a desaturated scene dominated by shades of gray and black. Positioned in the middle ground, the central figure wears a red full-body suit with a silver dual-tank apparatus on their back, while two other figures in dark attire walk slightly ahead on either side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
