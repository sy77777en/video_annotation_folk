  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, moving rapidly forward along a sharp, dark-red mountain ridge that extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, a bright sun and a large body of water are visible on the left, with rolling, brown hills occupying the middle ground on both sides under a partly cloudy sky. The camera flies at high speed, maintaining deep focus, and performs a visually pleasing maneuver with slight rolls. As it moves forward toward the peak during sunrise or sunset, a person is revealed standing still at the summit. The shot becomes a wide shot, revealing a lone figure in a bright red jacket with a yellow hood or hat and green or brown pants, with a backpack visible on the ground near him. The camera, positioned above the subject, then rapidly moves toward and pivots around the stationary person, executing a quick counterclockwise arc while tilting downward. This motion shifts the view to look down from the summit at the rugged terrain, ultimately returning to a high-angle perspective. The perspective then shifts to a rapid, spinning view from the summit, looking down at the surrounding landscape.",

    "Camera": "This video features a smooth aerial high-angle shot with a subtle tilt movement midway, transitioning seamlessly to a level angle. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The drone performs a visually pleasing maneuver, flying forward with slight rolls before smoothly progressing into a quick counterclockwise arc around a person standing on the mountain peak, tilting downward and ultimately returning to a high-angle perspective.",
    "Subject": "The video opens with a fast-moving aerial shot flying along the sharp ridge of a reddish-brown mountain. As the camera moves forward toward the peak against a bright sun, a lone figure is revealed standing at the summit. The camera then quickly moves toward and around this person, showing a man wearing a bright red jacket with a yellow hood or hat and green or brown pants. A backpack is visible on the ground near him as he stands on the mountaintop.",
    "Motion": "The camera flies at high speed along the sharp ridge of a mountain. As it moves forward toward the peak, a person is revealed standing still at the summit. The camera then rapidly moves toward and pivots around the stationary person, who is looking out over the landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight along the sharp, dark-red ridge of a mountain during sunrise or sunset. The low sun casts a golden glow across a vast landscape of rolling, brown hills, with a large body of water visible in the distance under a partly cloudy sky. The drone moves forward to reveal a lone person standing on the mountain's peak, and the perspective then shifts to a rapid, spinning view from the summit looking down at the rugged terrain.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, moving rapidly forward along a sharp mountain ridge that extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, a bright sun and a body of water are visible on the left, with rolling hills occupying the middle ground on both sides. As the camera advances, the shot becomes a wide shot, revealing a person standing at the mountain's peak. The camera, positioned above the subject, then moves quickly toward and around the person, who is now in the foreground, executing a fast, spinning motion that shifts the view to look down from the summit at the surrounding landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
