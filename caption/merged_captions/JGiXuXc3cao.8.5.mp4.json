  "merged_caption": "An animated submersible is initially visible in the center of the frame against a dark, greenish-blue background, suggesting a deep-sea environment. The vehicle has an elongated, rectangular shape with an open, truss-like frame that exposes its internal machinery, and a small, raised section is visible on the rear top. It is equipped with three powerful lights: one at the front pointing forward and down, and two at the rear pointing backward and down. As the camera simulates a zoom-out effect on this static 2D image, it moves left and downward while also incorporating a clockwise roll, revealing more of the underwater environment. In this expanded perspective, the submersible appears slightly above and to the right of the center. The bright, white beams from the lights illuminate a muted blue-green seafloor with subtle gradients indicating depth and distance. Two lights from the rear of the submersible highlight a large, partially buried structure resembling a submarine ruin in the lower left corner, with no other rocks visible on the seafloor. The illusion of movement is created by the camera's dynamic motion, enhancing the sense of depth and spatial relationships within the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features a simulated zoom-out effect on a 2D image, with the camera moving left and downward, while also incorporating a clockwise roll to reveal more of the underwater environment around the animated submersible.",
    "Subject": "An animated, blue-toned submersible vehicle is shown against a dark, greenish-blue background, suggesting a deep-sea environment. The vehicle has an elongated, rectangular shape with an open, truss-like frame that exposes its internal machinery. A small, raised section is visible on the rear top of the submersible. It is equipped with three powerful lights that cast bright, white beams into the darkness: one at the front pointing forward and down, and two at the rear pointing backward and down, illuminating a rocky or metallic surface on the seafloor below.",
    "Motion": "A static 2D image depicts a submersible vehicle and seafloor elements that remain motionless. The illusion of movement is created by the camera simulating a zoom-out, combined with leftward and downward motion, while also rotating clockwise.",
    "Scene": "In an animated underwater setting, a box-like submersible with a skeletal frame is stationary in dark, greenish-blue water. The vehicle, which has visible internal components, casts three bright, white beams of light forward and downward. These lights illuminate a muted blue-green seafloor with subtle gradients indicating depth and distance. Two lights from the rear of the submersible highlight a large, partially buried submarine-like ruin in the lower left corner, with no other rocks visible on the seafloor.",
    "Spatial": "An animated submersible is initially visible in the center of the frame against a dark, greenish-blue background. As the camera zooms out and rotates slightly clockwise, more of the seafloor comes into view. In this expanded perspective, the submersible appears slightly above and to the right of the center. Two lights from the rear of the submersible illuminate the lower left corner, revealing a large, partially buried structure that resembles a submarine ruin."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
