  "merged_caption": "This full shot captures three women seated at a large, curved, light brown wooden news desk, which extends from the foreground to the middle ground and occupies the center of the frame. The woman on the left has shoulder-length blonde hair and wears a black V-neck top, the woman in the center has dark brown, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in a red V-neck top, and the woman on the right has shoulder-length blonde hair and wears a black V-neck top. All three women are in the middle ground, positioned respectively on the left, center, and right sides of the desk, and appear to be engaged in a conversation, looking towards each other. Papers are visible on the desk in front of them, with a red mug also in the middle ground to the left of the leftmost woman. The background consists of dark blue studio walls, yellow-lit panels, and several television screens, with one prominent screen displaying \"WXII NEWS 12\" in the top left/center background. The camera remains static, positioned at eye level and a level angle, directly facing the subjects, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The woman on the left turns her head to the left, the woman in the middle faces the woman on the right, and the woman on the right turns her head to the left. All three women are speaking and appear to be looking at each other. The studio background features a large window set into the dark blue walls, with several television screens positioned behind it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
