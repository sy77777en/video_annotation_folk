  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot of a man riding a blue, red, and white racing motorcycle, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a paved racetrack in a sandy area. The rider, wearing a full set of racing gear with \"alpinestars\" branding and a matching helmet, is on a track bordered by a yellow and black curb. The camera captures the scene from a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective, utilizing a speed ramp effect that begins with a brief moment of reverse playback before transitioning to slow-motion forward playback. The motorcycle, covered in sponsor decals including \"APEX,\" \"ClickCease,\" \"Snap-on,\" and \"AMERICAN RACING,\" moves along the track while leaning into a banked turn. As the motorcyclist performs a wheelie, the camera tracks the subject, moving forward and tilting up slightly to keep them in the frame. The shot transitions from slow motion to normal speed as the rider stops leaning and accelerates, maintaining the main rider at the center of the screen in the midground. The camera slightly pans left and tilts upward, changing the framing to a wide shot, with a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp. By the end of the video, the motorcyclist becomes smaller in the shot, and another rider becomes visible in the distant background at the top of the frame. The bright, sunny day casts a distinct shadow on the track, enhancing the visual dynamics of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective. It utilizes a speed ramp effect, beginning with a brief moment of reverse playback before transitioning to slow-motion forward playback, and finally returning to normal speed. The camera tracks a motorcyclist performing a wheelie, moving forward and tilting up slightly to keep them in the frame. As the camera follows, the motorcyclist becomes smaller in the shot. Towards the end, the camera slightly pans left and tilts upward, with a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man is riding a racing motorcycle on a track. He is wearing a full set of racing gear, including a blue, white, and red suit with \"alpinestars\" branding, a matching helmet with red, white, and blue graphics, and black and white boots and gloves. The motorcycle is also blue, red, and white, and is covered in sponsor decals, with \"APEX\" written in large white letters with a red background on the side fairing, along with \"ClickCease,\" \"Snap-on,\" \"DRIVEN,\" \"GDH,\" \"ITR,\" \"ethika,\" \"DUNLOP,\" \"powered by TRIUMPH,\" \"DELL technologies,\" and several other indistinguishable brandings. There is also a prominent branding in the center of the bike with the text \"AMERICAN RACING,\" along with a smaller one that reads \"AMERICAN RACING ACADEMY.\" The rider is leaning low into a turn and gradually stops leaning at one point. By the end of the video, the camera stops the slow motion and tilts up, revealing another rider in the distance.",
    "Motion": "A racing motorcycle moves along a track while leaning into a turn. As the camera stops the slow motion and tilts upward, the motorcycle gradually increases speed, stops leaning, and another rider becomes visible in the distance.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a banked turn on a paved racetrack situated in a sandy area. The dark asphalt surface is bordered by a yellow and black curb along the outer edge of the turn. The scene takes place on a bright, sunny day, which casts a distinct shadow on the track. A single blue, red, and white racing motorcycle, with its rider, is on the track, gradually stopping its lean as it accelerates. The camera then tilts up, tracking the main subject and revealing another rider in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot of a motorcycle and rider positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a racetrack. The camera tracks the subject as it performs a wheelie while moving across the frame. As the motorcyclist turns and leans close to the road, the shot transitions from slow motion to normal speed, and the camera tilts up, changing the framing to a wide shot. This movement maintains the main rider at the center of the screen in the midground, while a second rider becomes visible in the distant background at the top of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
