  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a scenery shot, showing a small, blue and white kite, shaped like an airplane, in the center-upper center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground sky under an overcast sky. This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at the kite. The camera then tilts downward and pans from right to left, revealing a paved road in a residential area. A large tree is on the right side of the frame in the middle ground before going out of the frame, with modern houses and taller apartment buildings visible in the middle ground and background. A group of people and motorbikes initially appear in the bottom-center-left middle ground; as the camera pans, they move to the upper right middle ground. The back of a young girl's head, with dark, shoulder-length hair, enters the frame from the bottom left foreground. She is wearing a white and black horizontally striped sleeveless dress and purple and green sandals. The camera follows as the child, holding a blue plastic spool with a white string attached, walks away, moving toward the center of the frame. She jumps and walks a few steps forward on the road, then stops and raises the spool above her head with both hands, as if controlling the kite. The shot settles into a full shot of the child, who stops in the foreground, centered in the frame, with the road stretching into the middle ground in front of her. The group of people is now in the upper right middle ground, while houses and buildings are visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the child's height, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite in the sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans from right to left, shifting the focus to a little girl on the road. This movement changes the perspective to a high angle looking down at the girl. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a small, blue and white kite flying in the pale sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans to the left, focusing on a young girl seen from the back. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a white and black horizontally striped sleeveless dress and purple and green sandals. The girl is holding a blue plastic spool with a white string attached, which is connected to an object in the sky that is not visible within the frame. She is first observed walking away from the camera, then she stops and raises her arms above her head, as if controlling the kite.",
    "Motion": "A small kite flies in the sky. The camera then focuses on a young girl from behind as she jumps and walks a few steps forward on a paved road. She stops and raises a blue spool of string above her head with both hands.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on a paved road in a residential area under an overcast sky. On both sides of the road are grassy, unkempt patches of land with trees. On the left side, a group of people is either standing near or sitting on several parked motorbikes. In the background, modern houses and taller apartment buildings are visible. As the camera pans, a construction crane initially visible in the far distance moves out of the frame to the right. A blue and white kite, shaped like an airplane, flies high in the pale sky. In the foreground, a young child wearing a black-and-white striped dress stands on the road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
