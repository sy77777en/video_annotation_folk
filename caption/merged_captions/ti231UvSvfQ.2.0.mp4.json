  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot initially frames a young, light-skinned man's hands and arms on the right side of the frame as he draws on a desk, while his body is positioned on the left side. He is wearing a blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a white t-shirt. To the right in the foreground are various office supplies, including a notebook, a roll of tape, a red stapler, and a cup holding pens. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the papers on the desk, where the man holds a ruler steady with his left hand while using his right hand to draw something on the paper. His head remains tilted down in concentration throughout the clip. The camera then performs a slow tilt-up and slight pan to the left, shifting the focus to a close-up of the man's face in profile, which now occupies the left side of the frame. This is an eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the foreground in focus. In the out-of-focus middle ground and background, primarily in the center and right side of the scene, other people at their workstations remain visible. One man stands near a different desk, wearing a grey vest over a light-colored shirt and grey pants, while other indistinct figures are also visible, some of whom are seated. Their movements are minimal and indistinct. The scene takes place in a functional, office-like environment with a desaturated, cool-toned color palette. The background shows multiple computer monitors and simple office furniture. The shot concludes as the camera slightly advances and pans left to move closer to his profile, maintaining the focus on the young man's concentrated expression as he works.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the foreground in focus. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the papers on the desk. It then smoothly tilts up to frame the man's face, transitioning to a level angle. The shot concludes as the camera slightly advances and pans left to move closer to his profile.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, blond hair is shown in profile, sitting at a desk and concentrating on his work. He is wearing a blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a white t-shirt. He uses a ruler and a pen to draw on a piece of paper. In the out-of-focus background, another man stands near a different desk; he is wearing a grey vest over a light-colored shirt and grey pants. Other indistinct figures are also visible in the background, some of whom are seated.",
    "Motion": "A young man sits at a desk, leaning forward as he works. He holds a ruler steady on a piece of paper with his left hand while using his right hand to draw something on the paper. His head remains tilted down in concentration throughout the clip. In the out-of-focus background, other people are visible, with one man standing near a desk and others seated, but their movements are minimal and indistinct.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a functional, office-like environment with a desaturated, cool-toned color palette. In the foreground, a person sits at a wooden desk, using a ruler and pen to work on a drawing. The desk is cluttered with various supplies, including a notebook, a roll of tape, a red stapler, and a cup holding pens. The background, which is slightly out of focus, shows other people at their workstations, with multiple computer monitors and simple office furniture visible.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot initially frames a young man's hands and arms on the right side of the frame as he draws on a desk, while his body is positioned on the left side.

The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
