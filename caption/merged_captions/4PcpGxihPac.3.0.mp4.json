  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with a bald head is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is viewed from outside the car, through the windshield which serves as a foreground element. The man, wearing a light-colored, possibly light blue, collared shirt and a gold chain around his neck, sits in the driver's seat with his hands on the steering wheel located in the bottom right-center of the frame. His head slightly shakes side to side as he looks towards his front right with a concerned expression, wide eyes, and a slightly open mouth. A second, less distinct person with light-colored hair sits to his right, occupying the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. The entire scene is saturated with an intense, warm, reddish-orange light that reflects off the glass, partially obscuring the interior. This light flickers and grows brighter, illuminating the interior and casting a deep red hue over the scene. A thin white string hangs from the top left-center, situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, slowly and slightly moving forward throughout the shot while panning from left to right. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the driver's seat in the midground in focus.",

    "Camera": "This slow, smooth, eye-level shot moves forward while panning from left to right. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the driver's seat in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with a bald head, seen from the chest up through the windshield of a car. He is in the driver's seat, holding the steering wheel, and has a concerned expression with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. He wears a light-colored, possibly light blue, collared shirt, and a gold chain is visible around his neck. To his right, in the passenger seat, the blurry silhouette of a second person with light-colored hair is faintly visible. The entire scene is saturated with a strong orange-red light, suggesting an external light source. A white string hangs down from the area of the rearview mirror.",
    "Motion": "A man sits in the driver's seat of a car, with his head slightly shaking side to side. He holds the steering wheel and looks towards his front right as an intense red light from outside flickers and grows brighter, illuminating the interior.",
    "Scene": "The scene is viewed from outside a car, looking through the front windshield into the cabin at night. A bald man sits in the driver's seat, his hands on the steering wheel. The entire view is saturated with an intense, warm, reddish-orange light that reflects off the glass, partially obscuring the interior. This light intensifies slightly, casting a deep red hue over the scene. A second person is faintly visible in the passenger seat, and a thin white string hangs down near the center of the windshield.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
