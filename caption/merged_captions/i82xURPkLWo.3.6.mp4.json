  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot frames a man with a darker skin tone, a buzz cut hairstyle, and a neatly trimmed goatee, wearing a brown t-shirt, in the center foreground. He is seated, facing slightly to his left, with a rustic wooden wall and a window in the background, creating depth with a view of a green, natural setting outside. The camera is positioned at the man's level, using a shallow depth of field to emphasize him, and remains static throughout the clip as he stays in a fixed central position. The indoor setting features a weathered wooden structure with vertical planks and a few windows, suggesting a cozy, countryside interior with natural light streaming in to indicate daytime. The texture of the wooden structure is rough, with visible grain and signs of aging, contributing to the calm and natural atmosphere with muted colors. As the man begins speaking, his expression changes from a subtle smile to a more contemplative look, while he appears to be looking slightly downward. He then raises his right hand to rub his nose bridge, indicating a moment of contemplation or emphasis in his speech. After rubbing his nose, he continues to speak, maintaining a thoughtful expression. The setting suggests a relaxed, informal environment, and the overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the simplicity of the surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
