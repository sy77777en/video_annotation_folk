  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents an eye-level, symmetrical view down a long subway platform at the Monroe station on the Chicago Red Line. Rows of white, rectangular pillars line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background and creating a strong vanishing point perspective under a white, arched tunnel ceiling. The platform itself occupies the bottom of the frame, leading into the distance, while an arched tunnel ceiling fills the top. The environment is bathed in a cool, greenish-teal light from both overhead and side fluorescent fixtures. In the center of the frame, a suspended digital sign glows with white text on a red background, indicating the directions of the trains on either side and the wait time for the next train. A few distant figures are positioned centrally on the platform, also in the middle ground and background; some are seated while others stand or move minimally in the background. Station signs are attached to the pillars in the foreground on both the left and right. The camera moves smoothly forward, providing a long, centered view of the subway platform from a first-person point of view. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire length of the platform in sharp view. The scene captures the atmospheric essence of the subway platform, with silhouetted figures waiting for a train in the distance, all blending into the ambient lighting. The platform has a dark floor marked by a blue safety line along the edge, and the scene is largely static, emphasizing the serene yet dynamic environment of the underground station.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot moving forward down the subway platform. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire length of the platform in sharp view, presented from a first-person point of view.",
    "Subject": "A scenic view of a subway platform captures the atmospheric essence, with silhouetted figures waiting for a train in the distance, all blending into the ambient lighting.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves smoothly forward, providing a long, centered view of a subway platform. In the distance, several people are visible; some are seated while others stand or move minimally in the background. The scene is largely static.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a long, straight platform of an underground subway station, identified by signs as the Monroe station on the Chicago Red Line. The view looks down the length of the platform, where a series of white, rectangular pillars on either side creates a strong vanishing point perspective under a white, arched tunnel ceiling. The environment is bathed in a cool, greenish-teal light from both overhead and side fluorescent fixtures. In the distance, a suspended digital sign glows with white text on a red background, indicating the directions of the trains on either side and the wait time for the next train. A few distant figures are visible on the otherwise empty platform, which has a dark floor marked by a blue safety line along the edge.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
