  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a ground-level close-up shot, where the top and bottom of the frame are obscured by a dark foreground element, creating a narrow horizontal view. A pair of pale, veiny feet belonging to an unseen creature is visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark, reflective wooden floor. The feet are bare, with toes that resemble human toes, and there is occasional toe movement. From a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective under a bed, the camera moves upward, causing the screen to go black momentarily. The perspective then shifts upwards to an eye-level view from on top of the bed, settling on a wide shot of a dimly lit bedroom at night. In this final frame, a rumpled bed with white sheets and a green and white plaid blanket occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the screen. A white door is visible in the left background, next to a dark wooden dresser with a mirror on the right. The entire room is cast in deep shadow, with only faint ambient light illuminating the space. The creature is no longer visible in this final shot. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "From a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective under a bed, the camera moves upward to an eye-level view from on top of the bed. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video initially shows a pair of pale, veiny feet and lower legs belonging to an unseen creature, viewed from a low angle as if from under a bed. The creature's feet are bare, with toes that resemble human toes, and they stand on a dark, reflective floor. The perspective then shifts upwards, briefly going black before settling on a view across a bed with rumpled white sheets and a green and white plaid blanket in a dimly lit room. The creature is no longer visible in this final shot.",
    "Motion": "The video presents two first-person POV shots with minimal subject movement. Initially, a pair of feet is shown with occasional toe movement on a floor. The scene then transitions with an upward camera movement to a view across a bed in a dimly lit room.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dimly lit bedroom at night. A level-angle perspective from ground height beneath a bed shows a pair of pale, veiny feet standing on a dark, reflective wooden floor. The view then changes to a wider shot of the room, revealing a bed with rumpled white sheets and a green and white plaid blanket. In the background, a white door is visible next to a dark wooden dresser with a mirror. The entire room is cast in deep shadow, with only faint ambient light illuminating the space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
