  "merged_caption": "The video initially presents no distinct subject, with a tree trunk in sharp focus occupying the foreground on the left. A blurred man is visible in the midground, positioned towards the center. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field, and initially focuses on the tree in the foreground. The scene is set in a dim, outdoor forest environment, likely during dusk or in a heavily shaded area. The rough, dark brown bark of the tree trunk is in sharp focus, while the background shows a forest with blurred trees and foliage in muted green and gray tones. The shot transitions as the camera performs a rack focus to the man in the midground, who is wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt. The camera exhibits minor, slightly unsteady movement, subtly shifting leftward while executing a rightward pan with some shaking. The man leans slightly to his left, emerging more clearly from behind the right edge of the foreground tree, and comes into focus, shifting the shot to a close-up of him. He is then positioned in the center, with the foreground tree trunk remaining on the left. The man, who has a receding hairline with his long hair pulled back into a ponytail, becomes fully visible, leaning slightly to the side of the tree. His expression is serious and focused, and he is facing forward, looking intently in the direction of the camera. Other trees and foliage form the background, which remains consistent with the forest setting. When the man is revealed, the camera is at his level, and he continues to look in the direction of the camera throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video reveals a man in a forest setting. Initially, the camera is focused on the tree trunk in the foreground, causing the background to appear blurred, with only a partial view of the man's face visible. As the video progresses, the man becomes fully visible, leaning slightly to the side of the tree. He has a receding hairline with his long hair pulled back into a ponytail and is wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt. His expression is serious and focused, and he is facing forward, looking intently in the direction of the camera.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a tree trunk, with the background showing a forest with blurred trees and foliage. As the camera moves, the man in the background gradually comes into focus, revealing his face and upper body. The man is wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt and is leaning slightly to the side of the tree. He appears to be observing something intently, with a serious expression on his face. The background remains consistent with the forest setting, and the man continues to look in the direction of the camera throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dim, outdoor forest environment, likely during dusk or in a heavily shaded area. In the foreground, the rough, dark brown bark of a tree trunk is in sharp focus. The background is initially blurred but gradually comes into focus, revealing more trees and foliage in muted green and gray tones. A person, wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt, is visible in the middle ground, partially obscured by the trees, and moves slightly to become clearer.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
