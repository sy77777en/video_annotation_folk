  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a dark-skinned person with shoulder-length black hair and black-rimmed glasses stands in profile on a podium in the right foreground, wearing a multi-colored athletic jacket with white sleeves and a light blue and red torso. They have a red lanyard with a bronze-colored medal around their neck and hold a small, red plush toy with a yellow face. A blue podium is visible in the bottom-left foreground. In the middle ground, two men stand to the left on a red running track; the man farther away wears a white long-sleeved shirt and tan pants, while the man closer to the foreground wears a red tracksuit with white stripes. The stadium seating and an illuminated roof structure fill the rest of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, starts from a low, eye-level angle and moves backward while panning left and tilting down to frame the competition winner. This movement causes the main subject to shift from the right toward the center-right of the frame, while the two individuals in the middle ground move more centrally. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the athlete and the stadium background in clear view, and concludes with a level angle for clarity. The scene is set within a large, modern stadium at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights mounted on a complex white truss roof structure. A red running track with white lane markings encircles a green grass infield. In the background, rows of red spectator seats are visible in the stands, and a large digital screen displays the words \"VICTORY CEREMONY.\" Other individuals in athletic attire are positioned further down the track, and several white chairs are arranged on the grass.",

    "Motion": "The person with shoulder-length hair stands still in profile on a podium, holding a plush toy. The two men positioned in the middle ground also remain stationary throughout the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
