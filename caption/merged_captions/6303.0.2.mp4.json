  "merged_caption": "The video presents a static wide shot capturing the interior of a laundromat. The checkered black-and-white tile floor occupies the bottom portion of the frame in the middle ground. Washing machines with circular doors, some having green-tinted windows, are visible along the left and right walls, extending from the middle ground into the background. Two individuals are positioned in the middle ground; one is seated slightly left of the center on a bench, wearing a green shirt, light-colored pants, and headphones, with a relaxed posture, while the other stands slightly right of the center, holding a laundry basket and dressed in a bright red shirt with dark pants. Large, pink, balloon-like text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" is superimposed prominently in the central foreground, partially covering the two people. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera remains completely static throughout the video. In this indoor laundromat setting with vibrant blue walls and bright overhead fluorescent lighting, pink text begins to form in the air, starting as abstract, amorphous shapes and gradually taking the words 'KODAK ONHA'. The text becomes fully visible and remains in the center of the frame, while the two people in the background remain in their positions, one seated and the other standing with a laundry basket. The room's notable visual elements include large, pink, amorphous shapes that appear to float in the air, adding a surreal quality to the scene. These shapes are smooth and glossy, contrasting with the structured environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a wide shot of a laundry room with two people at the center. One person, whose gender is not clearly identifiable, is seated on a bench, wearing a green shirt, light-colored pants, and headphones, with a relaxed posture. The other person, standing nearby, is holding a laundry basket and is dressed in a bright red shirt with dark pants. The room has a checkered floor and several washing machines along the walls. Pink text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" appears prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the people, and seems to be added in post-production.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
