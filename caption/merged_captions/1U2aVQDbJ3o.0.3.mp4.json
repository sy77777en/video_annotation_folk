  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, featuring large numbers \"+30°\" and \"-30°\" on the hood, as it moves on a snowy surface. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the right side of the frame, with its front facing the camera. The car occupies the foreground, with the snowy track and evergreen trees forming the background. The drone camera starts at eye level with a high angle, capturing the car's aerodynamic design and the 'Porsche' logo on the roof. As the video progresses, the camera transitions to a level angle, moving backward to reveal a full front view of the car, before circling to the opposite side and transitioning back into a medium shot. The car continues moving and drifts around a curve, kicking up snow and emphasizing its dynamic movement through the snowy environment. The camera smoothly tracks the drifting race car, arcing clockwise and craning up and down to enhance motion, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. Finally, it transitions to a full shot of the car, filmed from its right rear side, showcasing its dynamic shape. The snowy track remains in the middle ground, while the trees stay in the background, creating depth in the scene. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow.",

    "Camera": "The video features a drone camera starting at eye level and moving to hip level. It begins with a high angle, transitions to a level angle, returns to a high angle, and finally settles at a level angle again, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly tracks a drifting race car, arcing clockwise and craning up and down to enhance motion. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30°\" and \"-30°,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface.",
    "Motion": "The video showcases a sports car with a red, blue, and white color scheme, featuring large numbers '+30°' and '-30°' on the hood, driving on a snowy surface. The car's front and side views are captured, highlighting its aerodynamic design and the 'Porsche' logo on the roof. The car continues moving and drifts around a curve, kicking up snow and emphasizing its dynamic movement through the snowy environment.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic outdoor scene on a snowy track. It features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, prominently displaying numbers and markings on its sleek, aerodynamic body. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be during the day, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow. The car is in motion, kicking up snow as it speeds along the track, emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of the sports car, capturing most of its body while it is in motion on a snowy surface. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the right side of the frame, with its front facing the camera. The car occupies the foreground, with the snowy track and evergreen trees forming the background. As the video progresses, the shot begins with a medium shot of the front section of a Porsche from the side. The camera then moves backward to reveal a full front view of the car, before circling to the opposite side and transitioning back into a medium shot. Finally, it transitions to a full shot of the car, filmed from its right rear side. The snowy track remains in the middle ground, while the trees stay in the background, creating depth in the scene. The camera captures the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
