  "merged_caption": "A medium shot centers on an animated figure wearing a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18, who leans forward, occupying the center of the composition. The character has short, dark hair and a determined expression, with glowing red eyes and red, vein-like energy surrounding him, highlighting his intense focus and power. The scene is set against a stark, minimalistic background composed of white and gray colors, emphasizing the character's actions and the energy around him. The character is depicted in motion, possibly running or charging forward, with his fists clenched and arms bent, actively moving vertically within the frame. Red, lightning-like energy surrounds the character, with some tendrils extending around him, adding a sense of motion and intensity. The camera is at the same height as the character, capturing the dynamic scene with smooth and stable camera movement that enhances the viewing experience. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character, whose expression and posture suggest action, with the red energy providing a vivid contrast to the otherwise monochrome setting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an intense scene featuring a character in a dynamic pose, set against a stark, minimalistic background. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character who is wearing a black and white sports uniform with the number 18.

    "Spatial": "A medium shot centers on an animated character, who leans forward, occupying the center of the composition.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
