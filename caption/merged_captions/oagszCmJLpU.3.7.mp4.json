  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide scenery shot with no major subjects, capturing a dramatic landscape scenery shot. The composition is dominated by a vast sky that occupies most of the frame, while a flat landscape lies at the bottom. A massive, dark storm cloud formation stretches across the lower middle of the frame, with a column of rain descending in the bottom center. Above this dark mass, lighter blue and white clouds fill the top of the frame. The foreground and middle ground consist of a green field with rows extending from the foreground to the background, receding toward the distant storm on the horizon. The entire cloud system is in rapid, time-lapsed motion, churning and shifting across the sky. This greatly accelerated time-lapse video captures a storm forming over a field, shot from a low angle with the camera height appearing to be between eye and overhead level. The deep focus keeps the entire landscape and sky sharp, while the camera pans slowly and smoothly from right to left across the scene, providing a coherent and immersive view of the unfolding weather phenomenon. The clouds churn and evolve, with a concentrated area of precipitation visible descending from the storm's base as it travels over the flat landscape. The shot's emphasis is on the powerful environmental display, capturing the feeling of being in the presence of a significant weather event. A large, dark blue-gray cloud formation dominates the view, hanging low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of precipitation falls in the distance. Above the dark storm, the sky is a lighter blue with wispy clouds, while a faint orange glow lines the horizon.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of an approaching storm rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky, where lighter, wispy blue and white clouds in the upper atmosphere give way to a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud that stretches across the lower half of the sky. This deep blue-black cloud formation hangs low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a flat expanse of green farmland, marked by faint rows leading toward the storm, meets a horizon glowing with a soft orange light, creating a stark contrast with the dark weather system above. The shot's emphasis is on the powerful environmental display, capturing the feeling of being in the presence of a significant weather event.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot. A massive, dark storm cloud system moves across the horizon in a time-lapse. The clouds churn and evolve, with a concentrated area of precipitation visible descending from the storm's base as it travels over the flat landscape.",
    "Scene": "In a time-lapse sequence over a vast, flat landscape, a massive storm system churns in the sky. A large, dark blue-gray cloud formation dominates the view, hanging low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of precipitation falls in the distance. Above the dark storm, the sky is a lighter blue with wispy clouds, while a faint orange glow lines the horizon. The foreground, extending into the background, features a dark green field with clearly visible rows stretching toward the distant weather event. The clouds are in constant, rapid motion, evolving and shifting across the expanse.",

The entire cloud system is in rapid, time-lapsed motion, churning and shifting across the sky. The camera is positioned at a high height relative to the field, looking up toward the horizon."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
