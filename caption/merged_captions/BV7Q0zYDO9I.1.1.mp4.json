  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, shows four white, mannequin-like figures and a chair arranged in a dark, reflective space. In the center middle ground, a figure is seated on a white chair, wearing a white polo shirt with visible tattoos, pants, and sneakers, leaning forward with his head bowed. To the right of the seated figure, another figure stands in the middle ground holding a dark, rifle-like object, dressed in a white polo shirt and pants. In the background to the left, a third figure also stands holding a similar object, similarly dressed. A fourth figure stands on the left in the middle ground, wearing a white t-shirt and shorts, with his head bowed and his back partially turned, and is the closest figure to the camera. The dark floor creates reflections of all the figures directly below them. The four figures in the scene remain completely motionless throughout the video. From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the central group of figures. The scene is rendered in a stark black-and-white style, with the brown rifle-like objects being the only exception. The floor is highly reflective, creating distorted mirror images of the figures below them. The scene is captured in deep focus, though the dark background makes this difficult to ascertain with certainty. An overlay in the form of a white subtitle at the bottom left of the screen reads \"[5].\"",

    "Subject": "In a stark, black-and-white scene, four stylized, white male figures are present. In the center, a figure wearing a white polo shirt with visible tattoos, pants, and sneakers is seated on a white chair, leaning forward with his head bowed. To his left, a standing figure in a white polo shirt, pants, and sneakers holds a dark, rifle-like object. To the right, another standing man, dressed similarly in a white polo shirt and pants, also holds a dark, rifle-like object. On the left, a fourth figure, wearing a white t-shirt and shorts, stands with his head bowed and his back partially turned. All figures have a smooth, mannequin-like appearance.",

    "Scene": "In a completely black, undefined space, four white, mannequin-like figures are arranged under a spotlight. The floor is highly reflective, creating distorted mirror images of the figures below them. One figure sits hunched over in a simple white chair at the center, while another stands to the left with its head bowed. Two other standing figures hold brown, rifle-like objects, with one positioned in the background to the left and the other in the middle ground to the right. The scene is rendered in a stark black-and-white style, with the brown objects being the only exception. An overlay in the form of a white subtitle at the bottom left of the screen reads \"[5].\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
