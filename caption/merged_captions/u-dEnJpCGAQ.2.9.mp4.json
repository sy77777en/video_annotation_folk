  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially shows a tabby cat with dark stripes on its brownish-grey fur and a striped tail positioned center-right in the middle ground, standing on a large, reddish-brown, textured rock formation that occupies the foreground and extends into the middle ground across the lower half of the frame. The scene is set outdoors in an arid, rocky landscape under a clear blue sky during the daytime. The camera is at a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. It pans left, tracking the cat with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking. The cat, oriented towards the left, begins walking from right to left and slightly downwards across the rock, moving towards the center-left of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. As it descends the reddish-brown rock, the cat slightly lowers its head to observe the rock's surface, with the tip of its tail slightly raised. At the end of the video, the cat jumps from the rock at the center-right of the frame to another rock located in the lower-left corner. In the background, a hazy expanse of low-lying green and brown vegetation stretches towards the horizon above the rocks, and a clear blue sky fills the top portion of the frame.",

    "Subject": "A tabby cat with dark stripes on its brownish-grey fur and a striped tail is on a large, reddish-brown, textured rock. The cat is oriented towards the left and is looking downwards.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in an arid, rocky landscape under a clear blue sky during the daytime. In the foreground, large, reddish-brown rocks with a coarse, granular texture dominate the view, bathed in abundant sunlight. A tabby cat is positioned on top of these sunlit rocks. In the background, a hazy expanse of low-lying green and brown vegetation stretches towards the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
