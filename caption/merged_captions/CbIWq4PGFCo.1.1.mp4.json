  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a young, fair-skinned man with short, wavy, dark brown hair, smudged with sand, and light stubble on his chin and upper lip. He is wearing a dark, dirty shirt and is positioned in the middle of the frame, looking down and slightly to his left with a somber, contemplative expression. The scene is set in a barren, outdoor landscape under the warm, soft light of either sunrise or sunset, with the ground consisting of uneven, light-brown sand or dry earth. Behind him, a blurry, barren landscape of light-brown earth occupies the background, with a sloping hill of similar arid terrain visible. The camera performs a slow, smooth counterclockwise arc around him, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. As the camera moves, the man remains mostly still, with only the subtle movement of his hair in the breeze and the occasional blink of his eyes, enhancing the melancholic and contemplative vibe. His gaze is directed towards the left of the frame due to the camera's position to his side.",

    "Subject": "A young, fair-skinned man with short, wavy, dark brown hair is shown in a close-up. His hair and face are smudged with sand, and he has some light stubble on his chin and upper lip.

He looks straight ahead relative to himself, but due to the camera being positioned to his side, his gaze is directed towards the left of the frame, with a somber, contemplative expression.",
    "Motion": "The man, dressed in a dark, worn T-shirt, gazes downward with a melancholic and contemplative vibe. He remains mostly still, with only the subtle movement of his hair in the breeze and the occasional blink of his eyes.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a barren, outdoor landscape under the warm, soft light of either sunrise or sunset. The ground consists of uneven, light-brown sand or dry earth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
