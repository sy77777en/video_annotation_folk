  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured at the subjects' level, initially frames two armored figures in the foreground, with one positioned on the left and the other on the right. In a dimly lit setting within a dense, dark forest at night, the figure on the left, clad in dark, metallic-looking armor with blue accents, swings a sword from his right to his left, striking the head of the person on the right, who is wearing similar dark armor with faint greenish highlights. The figure on the right briefly raises his left arm as he is hit. The ground is uneven, and a long, straight-bladed sword is embedded in the ground at the bottom center of the frame, set against tall, slender trees with bare branches in the background. As the figure on the left continues to swing the sword from his left to his right, the camera quickly zooms in and arcs clockwise around the action, transitioning the view into a medium shot. This movement causes the figures to fill more of the frame while the sword in the ground shifts to the bottom left corner. The camera maintains a smooth, eye-level shot with deep focus, capturing the rapid combat in a small, dimly lit clearing. The cool, faint light catches on their armor, creating brief flashes of blue and white against the pervasive darkness. The sword held by the figure on the left emits a faint blue metallic glow as it moves. The hilt of the sword embedded in the ground remains visible in the lower left corner as the camera zooms in and arcs, enhancing the dynamic motion of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot with a deep focus. The camera quickly zooms in on two people fighting and then performs a slight, quick clockwise arc around them.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, two armored figures are engaged in combat. The figure on the left, striking with a sword held in both hands, is clad in dark, metallic-looking armor highlighted with blue accents on the chest and shoulders. The sword emits a faint blue metallic glow as it moves towards the figure on the right, who is wearing similar dark armor with faint greenish highlights. Both figures are fully helmeted, obscuring their faces. In the distance at the bottom of the frame, a long, straight-bladed sword is stuck upright in the ground, with only the hilt visible in the lower left corner as the camera zooms in and arcs.",
    "Motion": "In a dark setting, an armored figure on the left swings a sword from his right to his left, striking the head of the person on the right. The figure on the right is being hit, with his left arm briefly raised. The figure on the left then continues to swing the sword from his left to his right.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dense, dark forest at night, under very low light conditions. Tall, slender trees with bare branches create an enclosing background, their forms mostly lost in deep shadows. The ground is uneven, and a single sword is partially embedded in the ground at an almost vertical angle, positioned in the distance at the bottom center of the scene. As the camera moves forward and arcs clockwise, only the hilt is visible in the lower left corner of the frame. In a small, dimly lit clearing, two figures in dark armor are engaged in rapid combat. Their movements are swift, and their forms are partially illuminated by a cool, faint light that catches on their armor, creating brief flashes of blue and white against the pervasive darkness.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured at the subjects' level, initially frames two armored figures in the foreground, with one positioned on the left and the other on the right. In the distance, a sword is embedded in the ground at the bottom center of the frame, all set against a dark forest in the background. As the figure on the left moves forward and to the right to engage in combat, the camera zooms in and arcs clockwise around the action. This movement transitions the view into a medium shot, causing the figures to fill more of the frame while the sword in the ground shifts to the bottom left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
