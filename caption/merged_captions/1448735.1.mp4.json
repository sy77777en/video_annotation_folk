  "merged_caption": "The video captures a dynamic view of a dense forest, with the camera beginning at ground level, moving forward and slightly tilting downward, offering a fresh perspective of the natural environment. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, and then transitions to a high angle, looking down from above. Trees with textured bark and vibrant green foliage are distributed across the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a layered and immersive scene. As the camera progresses, the ground appears lower, creating the illusion of an eye-level view despite the camera maintaining its height. In the foreground, moss-covered rocks and fallen branches occupy the bottom left and right areas of the frame, while a narrow dirt path meanders through the middle ground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. A small stream flows gently in the center and left side of the background, adding a tranquil element to the scene. The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with textured bark and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of moss, rocks, and fallen branches, adding texture and depth. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest scenery clearly. The movement is steady, providing a continuous view of the serene and lush forest environment. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's expanse and intricate details, maintaining the serene and untouched atmosphere of the forest throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, moving forward and tilting down smoothly through a forest. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, and then transitions to a high angle, looking down from above. As the camera progresses, the ground appears lower, creating the illusion of an eye-level view despite the camera maintaining its height. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest scenery clearly. The movement is steady.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the forest's atmosphere and scale. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall beauty and tranquility of the forest setting, rather than a specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with green foliage and a forest floor covered in moss and fallen logs. As the camera moves forward, more details of the forest become visible, including a path winding through the trees and scattered rocks. The sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the forest's natural beauty, including a large moss-covered rock and additional fallen logs. The path becomes more visible, leading deeper into the forest. The camera's movement is smooth and steady, providing a continuous view of the serene and lush forest environment.",

The ground is covered with a mix of moss, rocks, and fallen branches, adding texture and depth. A narrow dirt path winds through the trees, with a small stream flowing into the distance on the left side of the path, suggesting a natural trail.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
