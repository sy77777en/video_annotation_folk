  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a silhouetted scene. A large, donut-shaped object is positioned in the bottom left, with a smaller human figure to its left. A dark hill is visible on the right side, set against a misty, gray backdrop. Initially static, the camera performs a smooth, unsteady zoom-in before holding its position for the rest of the video. At the start, a silhouetted boy lies down on the left as a ring-shaped object rolls to the right side of the frame. The ring stops rolling, and the boy sits up, directing a beam of light from a flashlight towards it. As the light sweeps across the dark scene, it transforms the grayscale landscape into a colorful one with green grass and flowers, revealing the large, dark ring to be a pink-frosted donut with sprinkles. The scene briefly transitions to this colorful view where a silhouetted figure on the bottom left shines a light, illuminating a pink donut in the center, surrounded by green grass and flowers on a slope. The boy then turns off the flashlight, walks over to the donut, and leans forward to take a bite from it. The video then returns to the darker setting, where the silhouetted human figure now stands to the left of the large, donut-shaped object, which remains in the bottom left. The camera stays at the subjects' level throughout. The video is a third-person 2D side-view gaming video where the camera follows the character from a lateral perspective. The background is a misty, grayscale landscape with indistinct shapes, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The video ends with the character standing next to the donut-shaped object in the dark, foggy environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a silhouetted scene with two primary subjects. On the left, there is a large, round object resembling a wheel or a ring, standing upright on its side with the hole visible. It appears solid and dark against the misty background. To the left of this object, a small human figure is visible. This figure is also silhouetted, with glowing eyes that stand out against the dark form. Initially lying down, the figure, which appears to be a child based on its size and proportions, stands up, runs over to the large object, and takes a bite out of it. The background is a misty, grayscale landscape with indistinct shapes, creating a mysterious atmosphere.",

    "Scene": "The video is a third-person 2D side-view gaming video where the camera follows the character from a lateral perspective. It begins in a dark, foggy outdoor environment with a silhouetted donut-shaped object on the ground. As the character moves, areas illuminated by their flashlight become brightly lit, revealing a pink donut covered in sprinkles, flowers, and green grass. The video ends with the character standing next to the donut-shaped object in the dark, foggy environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
