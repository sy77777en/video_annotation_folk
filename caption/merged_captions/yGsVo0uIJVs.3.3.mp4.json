  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of the Central Intelligence Agency logo painted on a white brick wall, serving as the background. A dark vertical column is located in the corner of the room in the background on the left. From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera smoothly trucks to the right, starting with a view of the logo, which has a dark green outer ring with yellow trim, featuring the text \"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\" in white and \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in red. The center contains a white shield with a red, 16-pointed compass rose, surmounted by a bald eagle. As the camera moves, it dynamically reveals two stylized, white statues of figures seated at desks, who remain completely stationary throughout the shot. The camera transitions into a medium shot, maintaining a deep focus to keep both the CIA logo and the figures sharp and clear. In the final composition, the logo is now on the left side of the frame. A white, stylized statue of a man holding a red telephone receiver is in the right foreground, while a second statue of a woman is visible in the middle ground, positioned between the logo and the male statue. The figures are seated at a desk that extends from the foreground to the background wall. The scene is set indoors under cool, dim lighting, with a few books on the desk. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, capturing the statues' detailed features, such as the man in profile facing right, holding the red telephone receiver to his ear.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors against a white brick wall under cool, dim lighting. A large, circular seal of the Central Intelligence Agency is prominently displayed on the wall. The seal has a dark green background, a yellow border, and features a white eagle above a shield containing a red compass rose. The text \"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\" and \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" encircles the emblem. To the right of the seal, a statue-like figure in a dark suit is seated at a desk. In the foreground, an individual in a white shirt is visible holding a red telephone receiver to its ear. A few books are on the desk, and a dark vertical structure partially frames the left side of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
