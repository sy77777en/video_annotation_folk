  "merged_caption": "An extreme close-up shot frames the lower half of a middle-aged, light-skinned man's face in profile, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. He has graying stubble on his chin and jawline, and the collar of a dark, possibly blue or green, shirt is visible at the bottom left, also in the foreground. A plain, light greenish-blue wall occupies the right side of the frame in the background, which is slightly out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and while the framing is mostly static, there is a slight shake noticeable in the shot. The lighting is soft and even. The man remains mostly still throughout the shot, but subtly scrunches his face and seems to take a small step backward. This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing primarily on the lower half of the man's face in the foreground. The camera exhibits noticeable shaking throughout the video. His mouth is closed, and his expression is neutral.",

    "Scene": "In a tight, profile close-up, the lower half of a man's face is shown against a plain, light greenish-blue wall. His mouth is closed, and his jaw and chin are covered with short stubble. The collar of a dark blue shirt is visible at the bottom of the shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
