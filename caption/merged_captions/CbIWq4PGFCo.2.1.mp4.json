  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot centers on the back of a man's head and shoulders, which are centrally positioned in the foreground, occupying both the upper and lower portions of the frame. The man, with short, dark brown hair, is wearing a black t-shirt and remains completely still, facing away from the camera towards a vast, blurry, arid landscape that stretches across the middle ground and background. His ears and the back of his neck are visible, and his posture remains still throughout the video as he gazes downward. The scene looks out over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy sky, with a wide, dusty plain that stretches towards a soft-focus background of brown, rolling hills. The entire environment is bathed in a warm, muted light, casting the man's back into shadow while illuminating the barren terrain before him. Positioned at a level, eye-level angle, the camera focuses on the man in the foreground using an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera moves smoothly and slowly, arcing counterclockwise around him, indicating movement throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "A man with short, dark brown hair is seen from the back, facing away from the viewer. He is wearing a black t-shirt and appears to be sitting or kneeling while looking out at a distant, blurry landscape.

    "Scene": "From a perspective positioned behind a man with short, dark hair, the scene looks out over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy sky. The man, wearing a black t-shirt, is seated and still, facing a wide, dusty plain that stretches towards a soft-focus background of brown, rolling hills.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
