  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents a diner booth table setting in the foreground, with the broader diner environment in the middle and background. In the foreground, a white plate edged in blue and a fork are at the bottom left, a rectangular menu with a pink and black design is in the bottom center, a white mug containing a dark spoon is in the center, and a white bowl on a white saucer is in the center-right; two metallic condiment shakers and a yellow squeeze bottle are on the far left. The booth, featuring purple and white striped upholstery, occupies the middle ground across the center. The background reveals a diner counter with teal stools on the right, a window reflecting lights on the left, and various neon lights, framed pictures, and a menu board on the far wall. The camera is positioned at roughly seated eye-level, looking slightly down at the table, and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly zooms out slowly, capturing the scene without any shaking. The indoor scene is set in a retro-style diner, likely at night, given the prominent neon lighting. The booth is rendered in distinctive, stylized lighting, characterized by cool, cyan-toned light with neon pink and purple highlights. In the background, the diner counter is illuminated by pink and green neon lights. A window to the left reflects lights, suggesting an urban exterior, possibly on a rainy evening. The overall atmosphere is characterized by cool-toned lighting and a hazy quality. This video shows a still image of a diner booth with no discernible movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
