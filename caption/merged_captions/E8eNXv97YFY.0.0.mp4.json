  "merged_caption": "This scenery video begins with an extreme wide shot of a spacious public plaza under a partly cloudy sky. Initially, a curved fountain basin is located in the left middle ground, but as the camera moves smoothly and quickly forward, it transitions to the bottom left foreground and eventually disappears from the left corner. The expansive reddish-brown plaza extends from the foreground to the background, with a tall, slender white monument with an ornate, golden, traditional-style top appearing relatively small in the distant middle ground. Trees, including a prominent palm tree, and buildings line the plaza in the middle ground and background. As the camera approaches the central statue, it arcs counterclockwise around the monument, shifting its view to a low angle. The scene transitions to a wide shot, reframing the composition with the monument now slightly left of center in the middle ground. The camera circles around the monument, placing it in the center foreground, while the blue sky and white clouds dominate the background. The tops of some buildings and trees are visible at the bottom of the frame. Throughout the sequence, puffy white and grey clouds move swiftly across the sky, and a few people and vehicles can be seen moving quickly through the area, including a boy running across the plaza and people on scooters appearing briefly. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot, emphasizing the expansive atmosphere and architectural features of the location rather than any particular individual or object.",

    "Camera": "This is a fast-moving time-lapse video shot from eye-level. The camera moves smoothly and quickly forward, approaching a central statue. As it gets closer, the camera arcs counterclockwise around the statue, shifting its view to a low angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a spacious public square under a dramatic, cloud-filled sky. The video lacks a single main subject, as the wide-angle perspective and camera movement emphasize the expansive atmosphere and architectural features of the location rather than any particular individual or object. At the heart of the reddish-brown tiled plaza stands a tall, slender white monument with an ornate, golden, traditional-style top, surrounded by a decorative pool, benches, and green trees, including a prominent palm tree.",
    "Motion": "This is a dynamic, time-lapse video showcasing a spacious public square centered around a prominent monument with a golden, ornate top. The scene is set under a dramatic, cloudy sky with surrounding trees and buildings. While the focus is on the scenery, there is some minor subject motion, including a boy running across the plaza and people on scooters appearing briefly.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a large, open public plaza during the day under a partly cloudy sky. In the center of the red-brown paved plaza stands a tall, white monument with a gilded, ornate top, situated on a multi-tiered base. A curved, concrete fountain basin sits in the foreground. The plaza is lined with green trees and buildings in the background. Throughout the sequence, the camera's perspective shifts around the central monument, while puffy white and grey clouds move swiftly across the blue sky. A few people and vehicles can be seen moving quickly through the area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
