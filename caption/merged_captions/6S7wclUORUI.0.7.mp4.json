  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle long shot, capturing a vast area of reddish-brown ground filled with hundreds of people, predominantly men, lying in organized rows that stretch from the bottom of the frame into the background. These individuals are positioned either on their backs or face down, mostly dressed in 19th-century attire, including dark blue and grey military-style uniforms. A train is positioned in the top left background, with a wooden support structure in the left middle ground and a water tower in the lower right middle ground. Train tracks cut through the scene, with a train visible on the left and a wooden water tower with a conical roof in the lower right. A few individuals, including several women in long dark dresses and white bonnets, walk among the prone figures, along with men in similar clothing, some of whom are carrying others on stretchers. Two pots emitting white smoke can be seen among the crowd. The camera moves backward and upward in a slightly unsteady motion, gradually revealing the full scale of the area. As the camera pulls backward, a large, tattered Confederate battle flag—red with a blue saltire containing white stars—enters from the bottom left foreground, waving as it moves to occupy most of the left side of the frame. This movement reframes the initial scene, pushing the view of the people and the train station into the right half and background of the composition. The camera's height, initially high above the people, shifts to be at the same height as the flag in the foreground by the end of the shot. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp from foreground to background.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle aerial shot captures a vast scene of wounded soldiers laid out on the ground. The camera moves backward and upward in a slightly unsteady motion, gradually revealing the full scale of the area. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp from foreground to background.",
    "Subject": "A high-angle view reveals a vast, open area of reddish-brown dirt covered with hundreds of people, predominantly men, lying in organized rows. These individuals are positioned either on their backs or face down. Most of these men are dressed in 19th-century attire, including dark blue and grey military-style uniforms. Several women, wearing long dark dresses and white bonnets, walk among the prone figures, along with men in similar clothing, some of whom are carrying others on stretchers. As the view pulls back, a large, tattered Confederate battle flag—red with a blue saltire containing white stars—enters from the lower left, waving as it moves to occupy a significant portion of the foreground.",
    "Motion": "The scene begins with a high-angle view where a few people walk among hundreds of prone figures lying in rows on the ground, with some individuals carrying others on stretchers. The camera then slowly pulls back, and a large, tattered Confederate battle flag enters the frame from the lower left, occupying the entire left side of the foreground as it waves.",
    "Scene": "In a high-angle, daytime shot, a vast, open expanse of reddish-brown dirt next to a train station is densely packed with wounded and deceased soldiers lying in rows on the ground. Train tracks cut through the scene, with a train visible on the left and a wooden water tower with a conical roof in the lower right. A wooden support structure is visible on the left side, and two pots emitting white smoke can be seen among the crowd. A few individuals walk among the prone figures. From the lower-left corner, a large, tattered red flag with a blue saltire and white stars—a Confederate battle flag—waves in the wind, partially covering the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
