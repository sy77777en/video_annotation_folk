  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair standing in the center of the frame on a stage within an indoor venue. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, knee-length dress with a subtle pattern, paired with black knee-high boots, and is accessorized with a necklace, earrings, a silver bracelet on her left forearm, and a ring on her left hand. She stands on a red carpet that occupies the bottom of the frame, holding a small black object in her right hand, with a focused expression as she speaks through a headset microphone positioned on the right side of her face. In the background, a large, illuminated wall with a vibrant blue, geometric pattern composed of angular, faceted surfaces fills the space behind her. The lighting is focused on the central area of the stage. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, captures the speaker from an eye-level, level-angle perspective. A deep focus keeps both the speaker and the background sharp. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, maintaining a clear view of the scene. The woman makes subtle movements while speaking, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static composition.",

She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, knee-length dress with a subtle pattern, paired with black knee-high boots. She is accessorized with a necklace, earrings, a silver bracelet on her left forearm, and a ring on her left hand.

    "Scene": "The scene takes place on a stage within an indoor venue. A woman stands at the center of a rectangular red carpet that covers a portion of the dark stage floor. The background consists of a large, illuminated wall with a vibrant blue, geometric pattern composed of angular, faceted surfaces. The lighting is focused on the central area of the stage.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
