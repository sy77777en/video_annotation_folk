  "merged_caption": "The shot begins as a close-up on a shirtless man with brown skin, a full dark beard, and a braided necklace with a white shell pendant in the foreground on the center-right, whose hand is held up in a peace sign in the center-left foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, focusing initially on the man's hand before smoothly moving slightly forward and panning left. As it moves, it performs a rack focus to a line of several men and women with brown skin, dressed in traditional-looking attire featuring skirts made of a straw-like material, positioned in the middle ground, stretching from the left to the center of the frame. The hilly landscape occupies the background under a blue sky. The man in the foreground turns his head to look at the line of men and women behind him before facing the camera again. In the middle ground, the people rest their chins on each other's shoulders, except for a woman at the front of the line who has long dark hair and wears a top with a red, white, and black pattern. Between the foreground man and the line, another person is partially seen holding a pink smartphone, seemingly taking a picture. Additionally, another woman, positioned in front and to the right of the line, is holding a camera. The shot then transitions to a medium full shot, reframing the group of people from the middle ground to become the primary subject. The lighting is soft and even, enhancing the natural beauty of the vast, green landscape.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, straight-on shot with a shallow depth of field. The camera initially focuses on the hand of the man in the foreground before smoothly moving slightly forward and panning left. As it moves, it performs a rack focus to the group of people standing in the midground.",
    "Subject": "A shirtless man with brown skin, a full dark beard, and a braided necklace with a white shell pendant is in the foreground, holding up a peace sign with his right hand. Behind him stands a line of several men and women, also with brown skin, dressed in traditional-looking attire featuring skirts made of a straw-like material. The men in the middle ground are also shirtless. A woman near the center of the group has long dark hair and wears a top with a red, white, and black pattern. Between the foreground man and the line of women and men, another person is partially seen holding a pink smartphone, seemingly taking a picture.",
    "Motion": "The scene captures a group of people posing, with a man in the foreground holding up a peace sign. He turns his head to look at the line of men and women behind him before facing the camera again. In the middle ground, the people rest their chins on each other's shoulders, except for a woman at the front of the line. Additionally, another woman, positioned in front and to the right of the line, is holding a camera.",
    "Scene": "Outdoors, a group of people stand in a line against a backdrop of a vast, green, hilly landscape under a blue sky. The people are dressed in garments made of a brown, straw-like material. In the foreground, a man with a dark beard, wearing a woven, rope-like necklace with a white shell pendant, holds up a hand in a peace sign. He is positioned in front of the group, slightly to the right, with a person who is partially visible holding a smartphone positioned between him and the line. The lighting is soft and even.",
    "Spatial": "The shot begins as a close-up on a man in the foreground on the center-right, whose hand is held up in a peace sign in the center-left foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
