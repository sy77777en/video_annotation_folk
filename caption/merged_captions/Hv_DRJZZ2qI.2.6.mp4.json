  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a fair-skinned woman with blonde hair, wearing a white, cable-knit beanie, is positioned in the center of the frame. The video starts with a shaky, eye-level, level-angle shot, characterized by significant motion blur, as she holds her hands over her mouth. The camera intentionally moves to keep her face centered as she lowers her hands, starts clapping, and slightly bounces in the foreground while smiling. Her facial expression shows a wide-open mouth and scrunched, closed eyes. On her left wrist, she wears a black bracelet and a colorful wristband that is predominantly red, while on her right wrist, there is a thin, greyish wristband. As she gradually calms down from her slight jumping and bouncing, the motion blur reduces. The scene takes place outdoors in a dry, arid environment under natural daylight. The ground consists of light brown dirt and sand, with sparse, dry bushes scattered across the landscape. A blurry, sandy hillside forms the background, and a person wearing a light-colored knit beanie is visible in the foreground. Throughout the shot, a blurry, arid landscape with dry bushes occupies the background, and the shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the woman as she moves around and celebrates.",

    "Motion": "The video starts with a shaky, close-up shot of a woman who has her hands over her mouth. As the camera continues to move to keep her face near the center of the frame, she lowers her hands, starts clapping, and jumps around while smiling.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors in a dry, arid environment under natural daylight. The ground consists of light brown dirt and sand, with sparse, dry bushes scattered across the landscape. A blurry, sandy hillside forms the background. The shot is characterized by significant motion blur, suggesting rapid movement within the scene. A person wearing a light-colored knit beanie is visible in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
