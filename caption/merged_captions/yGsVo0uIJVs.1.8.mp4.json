  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, showing the lower bodies of several static 3D models of men in dark green uniforms: the leftmost figure is visible from the waist up, the rightmost from the knee up, and the others from approximately the knee to the center of the torso. They stand around a large wooden table that occupies the center of the frame. In the middle ground, two detailed, vintage-style naval charts titled \"U.S. NAVAL OPERATIONS PACIFIC OCEAN AREAS WORLD WAR II\" are laid on the table, rendered in black ink on off-white paper, depicting various islands and sea routes. A small, dark gray model of a submarine, complete with a conning tower and tail fins, is positioned in the center of the closer map, which shows locations such as the Philippine Islands and the Solomon Islands. A text overlay is visible in the bottom left corner. From a high, eye-level perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus as it moves smoothly downward and slightly forward toward the submarine model resting on the map. As the view focuses on the submarine model, the figures of men standing around the table are gradually cropped out of the frame. The camera then moves forward and downward, transitioning into a full shot of the submarine model, which remains centered in the frame throughout the video. The high-angle perspective is maintained, focusing on the submarine model that occupies most of the height of the frame, while the figures and the upper map move out of the frame. During this transition, the initial text overlay in the bottom left corner is replaced by a new one, with shifting letters eventually spelling out \"USS HALIBUT,\" after which it remains static for the duration of the video. Additionally, there is another overlay watermark in the very bottom left corner of the video that reads \"[6] geographicus.com.\"",

    "Camera": "From a high, eye-level perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus as it moves smoothly downward and slightly forward. The camera's movement is directed toward a small submarine model resting on a map on a wooden table. As it nears the model, the camera tilts up slightly to ensure the submarine model remains centered in the frame.",
    "Subject": "Several static 3D models of men in dark green uniforms stand around a large wooden table. On the table's surface are two large, beige-colored maps with black markings, detailing U.S. Naval Operations in the Pacific Ocean. A small, dark gray model of a submarine, complete with a conning tower and tail fins, is positioned on the map closer to the camera. As the scene's focus shifts to a closer view of this submarine model on the map, the men standing around the table fall out of frame.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward and downward towards a model submarine resting on a map of the Pacific Ocean, which is laid out on a wooden table. As the view focuses on the submarine model, the figures of men standing around the table are gradually cropped out of the frame. The submarine model, maps, and figures all remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room, several static 3D models in dark green uniforms stand around a large wooden table. Spread across the tabletop are two detailed, vintage-style naval charts titled \"U.S. NAVAL OPERATIONS PACIFIC OCEAN AREAS WORLD WAR II.\" The maps, rendered in black ink on off-white paper, depict various islands and sea routes. A small, dark gray model of a submarine is positioned on the lower map, which shows locations such as the Philippine Islands and the Solomon Islands. The scene slowly zooms in on the submarine model. An overlay text in the bottom left corner initially appears with shifting letters, eventually spelling out \"USS HALIBUT,\" after which it remains static for the duration of the video. Additionally, there is another overlay watermark in the very bottom left corner of the video that reads \"[6] geographicus.com.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
