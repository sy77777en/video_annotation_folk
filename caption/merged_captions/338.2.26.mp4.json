  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, eating noodles with chopsticks while holding a portable electric fan. He is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, with his upper body visible, and the camera is at his eye level. The middle ground includes a server in a maroon shirt standing near the top central left and other diners seated at tables. The background features intricate wall murals and patterned carpets. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. It then smoothly pans left and tilts down, transitioning from the man to a wider shot. This reveals a robotic vacuum cleaner with a teal top in the bottom center of the frame, moving on the geometric patterned carpeted floor in the middle ground. The vacuum cleaner is smaller in scale compared to the initial subject. The camera shifts to a higher angle, looking down at the floor. The dining area remains in the middle ground, with tables and diners scattered throughout, including a woman in a colorful sleeveless top and a man in a hat. The restaurant is filled with other diners, some engaged in conversation, creating a lively ambiance. The environment features several round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The walls are adorned with large, intricate murals depicting scenes with earthy tones, adding a cultural touch to the space. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting a cozy, relaxed time of day. The camera movement provides a broader view of the restaurant, capturing the lively interaction among patrons and staff. The transition from the initial medium close-up to the wider shot effectively showcases the dynamic environment of the restaurant.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
