  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of three men seated inside a car, captured from the front at their eye level. The man on the left has a medium skin tone, wearing a dark hat and jacket, while the man in the middle, with a lighter skin tone, wears a light-colored hat and a beige jacket over a green shirt. The man on the right, with a deep brown complexion, is the driver, wearing a dark hat and jacket. All three are in the midground, with the background outside the car blurred, suggesting a tree-lined street. The bottom of the frame in the foreground shows the car's hood and windshield wipers. The scene takes place during the day, as indicated by the natural light filtering through the windows. The car's interior features a rearview mirror and windshield wiper, with dark upholstery complementing the overall muted color scheme. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The man in the middle is gesturing and talking animatedly, while the other two listen attentively. The man on the left turns his head to focus on the speaker, indicating his engagement. Throughout the conversation, the man in the middle continues to gesture and sway his head as he speaks, maintaining the attention of his companions. Overlay text is present, displaying a quote: \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee, prominently placed across the scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the sequence, as the camera remains static, maintaining a consistent view of the subjects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
