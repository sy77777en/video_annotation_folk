  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of scenery featuring a lighthouse. Initially, the middle section of a dilapidated lighthouse is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A turbulent, green-hued sky occupies the background, while streaks of rain fall in the foreground across the entire scene. The camera smoothly moves upward, revealing the top of a weathered lighthouse against a rainy, overcast sky. As the view moves upward along the height of the dilapidated tower, the focus shifts to the upper portion of the tower against a dark, cloudy sky. The octagonal tower shows signs of disrepair, featuring boarded-up windows and broken sections of masonry. At its peak is a dark, caged lantern room. The lighthouse remains stationary on the right side of the frame throughout this movement. The overall mood is somber and atmospheric, with the oppressive atmosphere emphasized by the heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment. This scene is depicted in a 2D animation.",

    "Subject": "This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.",
    "Motion": "The video captures an upward-moving shot of an old, weathered lighthouse during a heavy rainstorm, focusing on the upper portion of the tower against a dark, cloudy sky. The overall mood is somber and atmospheric.",
    "Scene": "A weathered, light-gray lighthouse stands against a dark, turbulent sky during a heavy downpour, with rain falling in white streaks across the scene. The octagonal tower shows signs of disrepair, featuring boarded-up windows and broken sections of masonry. At its peak is a dark, caged lantern room. Behind the structure, the sky is a gloomy expanse of swirling green and gray clouds as the view moves upward along the height of the dilapidated tower. This scene is depicted in a 2D animation.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of scenery featuring a lighthouse. Initially, the middle section of a dilapidated lighthouse is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A turbulent, green-hued sky occupies the background, while streaks of rain fall in the foreground across the entire scene. The camera moves upward, following the height of the tower to reveal its dark, caged lantern room at the top.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
