  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a light-skinned woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is positioned in the center foreground, speaking into a black microphone with a red and white logo cube that reads \"SPORTS.\" She wears a light-colored top with textured shoulders and a silver hoop earring. The camera, positioned at eye-level, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on her, with a slight unsteadiness suggesting a handheld camera. She subtly moves as she holds the microphone up to her mouth and speaks. She is surrounded by a dense crowd of people in dark clothing in the middle ground and background, creating a crowded, focused environment. To her left, a man with light skin in a dark suit holds a professional camera with a large lens, while to her right, another light-skinned man in a dark suit holds up a microphone. Additional male reporters in the background are holding cameras, all focused on the interviewee she is reporting about. The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor space with orange walls, enhancing the vibrant atmosphere. The tight grouping of people and equipment frames the central woman, emphasizing her role as the focal point of the scene.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the female reporter in the foreground. The shot is mostly static, with a slight unsteadiness suggesting a handheld camera.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is centered, speaking into a black microphone that she holds. The microphone has a red and white logo with the word \"SPORTS\" on it. She wears a light-colored top with textured shoulders and a silver hoop earring.

To her right, another light-skinned man in a dark suit holds up a microphone. Other male reporters in the background are holding cameras, all focused on the interviewee she is reporting about.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands in the center of a crowd of reporters, subtly moving as she holds a microphone up to her mouth and speaks, while the surrounding people hold cameras and other microphones aimed at her.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit indoor space with orange walls, a woman in a light-colored top stands at the center of a dense crowd. She holds a black microphone with a red and white logo cube towards her mouth. She is surrounded by numerous people in dark clothing who are holding up cameras with large lenses and microphones, pointing them towards the center.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
