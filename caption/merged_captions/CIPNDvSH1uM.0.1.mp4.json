  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot filmed at the subject's level, a metallic blue car with a thin, double gold pinstripe that follows the contours of its body and wheel well occupies the foreground, positioned on the right side of the frame. The camera, locked to the front right of the car, maintains a fixed position relative to it, moving backward as the car advances along a winding, two-lane road during the daytime. The car, featuring a silver wheel with a black tire, a black side mirror, and an orange side marker light, drives forward, entering a shadowed area, exiting it, and then entering a second shadowed area. On the left, a road extends from the foreground into the background, accompanied by a wooden fence and utility poles. The lighting on the blue car's body shifts as it passes through patches of sunlight and shadow under a clear, sunny sky through a hilly landscape covered in green brush and trees. A white police sedan with a flashing red light on its roof is visible on the same road, appearing on the left side of the frame behind the blue car. As the blue car travels forward, the police car, which approaches from the rear in the same lane, remains in the background, maintaining its relative distance. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the car and the road behind it clear.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level, and level angle, the camera appears locked to the front right of a blue car, moving backward as the car advances. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the car and the road behind it clear.",
    "Subject": "A metallic blue car is shown from a level angle. The camera is positioned at the right front of the car, highlighting its front and side view. The car features a thin, double gold pinstripe that follows the contours of its body and wheel well. It has a silver wheel with a black tire, a black side mirror, and an orange side marker light on the side of the car. In the background, a white police sedan with a flashing red light on its roof is visible on the same road.",
    "Motion": "A blue car drives forward along a winding road, entering a shadowed area, exiting it, and then entering a second shadowed area. In the background, a white police car with a flashing red light on its roof drives in the same direction.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted low on the right front side of a metallic blue sports car, the perspective remains fixed as the vehicle travels along a winding, two-lane road during the daytime. The car, which features gold pinstriping, moves under a clear, sunny sky through a hilly landscape covered in green brush and trees. A wooden fence and utility poles run parallel to the grey asphalt road, which is marked with a solid white line. As the car proceeds, a white vehicle with a red light on its roof approaches from the rear in the same lane. The lighting on the blue car's body shifts as it passes through patches of sunlight and shadow.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot filmed at the subject's level, a blue car occupies the foreground, positioned on the right side of the frame. The camera maintains a fixed position relative to this car. On the left, a road extends from the foreground into the background, accompanied by a wooden fence and utility poles. A white police car appears on the left side of the frame behind the blue car. As the blue car travels forward, the police car remains in the background, maintaining its relative distance."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
