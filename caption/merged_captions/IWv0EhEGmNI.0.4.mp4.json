  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot from a fixed, forward-facing camera mounted at dashboard height inside a car, capturing the entire width of a rural two-lane road at night. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead through a car windshield. It moves forward along the road, with slightly unsteady motion and some shaking, simulating the perspective from inside a moving vehicle. The road runs horizontally through the center of the frame in the midground and background, with grassy verges and utility poles positioned along the left and right edges. The wet pavement reflects the lights of oncoming vehicles and stationary police cars, which are initially visible in the background and then move into the midground as the car approaches. The police cars are positioned on the left and right sides of the road, with their flashing lights illuminating the scene. A portion of the car's dashboard and the windshield wipers are visible in the bottom foreground, with the wipers occasionally obscuring the view. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the background (the road and vehicles ahead) in focus while the foreground (dashboard and windshield) remains out of focus. Subtitles appear in the lower center of the frame displaying dialogue in white and green text: \"Kyle: Three seconds...\" and \"Price: That's plenty of time...\". The atmosphere is tense and moody, enhanced by the limited visibility, the rhythmic sweep of windshield wipers, and the presence of emergency vehicles. In the distance, the blurry figures of two guards can be seen waving. The focus is on the environment and the interplay of light, weather, and open space, emphasizing the ambiance and scale of the setting rather than a central subject.",

    "Subject": "The video offers a dynamic nighttime roadscape view from inside a car, with the camera mounted facing forward. The scene captures a dimly lit, rain-soaked rural road bordered by grassy verges and utility poles. The windshield wipers move constantly, adding motion to the view through the rain-speckled windshield. The wet pavement reflects the glare of oncoming headlights and the flashing lights of a stationary police car, creating a moody, atmospheric scene. The focus is on the environment and the interplay of light, weather, and open space, emphasizing the ambiance and scale of the setting rather than a central subject.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a nighttime drive down a wet, rural road, viewed from inside a vehicle. Headlights and police lights illuminate the dark, rainy scene, with reflections glistening on the pavement and grassy shoulders visible on either side. The atmosphere is tense and moody, enhanced by the limited visibility, the rhythmic sweep of windshield wipers, and the presence of emergency vehicles. In the distance, the blurry figures of two guards can be seen waving.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead, showing a rural two-lane road at night with wet pavement reflecting headlights and streetlights. The environment is outdoors, bordered by grassy shoulders and utility poles, with some low vegetation visible along the roadside. The sky is dark, and the road surface glistens from recent rain, with water droplets occasionally visible on the windshield. Several vehicles are present, including two police cars in the distance with roofs flashing alternating red and blue lights. The car on the left is facing the camera, with its headlights emitting beams of light, while the car on the right is facing away. Two guards are standing on the road between the two cars, waving at the camera. The windshield wiper is in motion, clearing rain from the glass. Overlay elements include subtitles in the lower center displaying dialogue in white and green text: \"Kyle: Three seconds...\" and \"Price: That's plenty of time...\".",

A portion of the car's dashboard and the windshield wipers are visible in the bottom foreground, with the wipers occasionally obscuring the view. Subtitles appear in the lower center of the frame. The camera remains at a consistent height, level with the dashboard, and does not tilt or pan, but the spatial relationship between the car and the roadside elements changes as the vehicle moves forward, bringing distant elements into the midground and foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
