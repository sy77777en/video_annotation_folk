  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot in an indoor setting characterized by a spacious hall with a smooth, grey floor and plain, light grey walls. In the midground, five light gray humanoid figures are arranged horizontally across the center of the frame, performing push-ups in a synchronized manner. These figures are bald and wear light gray, short-sleeved t-shirts and shorts. The figures in the first row, who are the main focus, have distinctive black and white patterned forearms and hands, resembling robotic or prosthetic limbs, while the other two midground figures have plain light gray limbs. The camera is positioned at the level of the figures performing push-ups and maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the figures in the midground. The camera movement is very smooth, moving backward and upward while slightly panning to the left. A blurred blue figure is visible in the foreground on the left side. Three additional blurred blue figures stand in the midground, positioned behind and slightly to the sides of the light gray figures, appearing to wear uniform-like attire including boots, and seem to be observing the figures performing push-ups. The figures' movements are consistent and coordinated, indicating a structured exercise routine. The scene is illuminated by even, diffuse lighting. An overlay text [40] is visible in the lower left corner of the video. The video is shot in slow motion, enhancing the synchronized motion of the push-ups against the plain, gray floor. The three partially visible blue figures in the background have only their lower bodies shown, making it unclear if they are observing the push-up performance. The overall composition and camera work create a dynamic yet orderly depiction of the exercise routine.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is shot from a hip-level, high angle. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the figures in the midground. The camera movement is very smooth, moving backward and upward while slightly panning to the left.",
    "Subject": "The video features several humanoid figures. In the midground, five light gray figures are in a push-up position on a gray floor. These figures are bald and wear light gray, short-sleeved t-shirts and shorts. The figures in the first row, who are the main focus, have distinctive black and white patterned forearms and hands, resembling robotic or prosthetic limbs, while the other two midground figures have plain light gray limbs. In the true foreground, a blurred blue figure is visible on the left side of the frame. Additionally, there are three visible blue figures that are also blurred, positioned in the midground, appearing to wear uniform-like attire including boots, and seem to be observing the figures performing push-ups.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a group of five humanoid figures lying on the ground, performing push-ups in a synchronized manner. The figures are positioned in a line, with their hands placed on the ground and their bodies moving up and down in unison. The background is a plain, gray floor, and there are three partially visible blue figures in the background, with only their lower bodies shown, making it unclear if they are observing the push-up performance. Additionally, there is a blurred blue figure on the far left side of the frame. The figures' movements are consistent and coordinated, indicating a structured exercise routine.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting, characterized by a spacious hall with a smooth, grey floor and plain, light grey walls. In the midground, multiple humanoid figures, primarily white or light grey, are in a push-up position; some of these figures display black markings on their arms. In the foreground on the far left of the frame, there is a blue figure. Further back, several uniformly blue humanoid figures are standing, with three of them positioned behind the white or light grey figures. The scene is illuminated by even, diffuse lighting. An overlay text [40] is visible in the lower left corner of the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot. In the midground, five light gray figures are arranged horizontally across the center of the frame, performing push-ups. A blurred blue figure is visible in the foreground on the left side. Three additional blurred blue figures stand in the midground, positioned behind and slightly to the sides of the light gray figures. The camera is positioned at the level of the figures performing push-ups."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
