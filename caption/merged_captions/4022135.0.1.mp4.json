  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot from the stadium stands, capturing the football field extending across the bottom of the frame. The stands on the opposite side fill the background across the center of the frame, with a cloudy sky visible above. Initially, the back of a spectator's head is in the bottom right foreground. Filmed from a high vantage point, the camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire football stadium sharp. Positioned at eye level relative to the platform, the camera performs a smooth, intermittent pan to the right, revealing more of the stadium. This movement brings the right end zone and a goalpost from the middle ground on the right side to the left side, while a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" enters the frame in the middle ground on the far right. Simultaneously, more spectators in the immediate foreground are revealed at the bottom right, including a man in a cap shown in profile, as the initial spectator's head shifts toward the bottom left corner of the view. The green turf is marked with white yard lines, a large white \"N\" logo at midfield, and the word \"WILDCATS\" in the end zone. Football players in white and dark uniforms are positioned on the field. The stands are packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple. Beyond the stadium, a line of green trees and distant buildings are visible beneath a grey sky. Tall light towers with bright lights are on. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more of the stadium's architecture, including a tan building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side. The back of a spectator's head is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the view.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a high vantage point, the camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire football stadium sharp. Positioned at eye level relative to the platform, the camera performs a smooth, intermittent pan to the right, revealing more of the crowded stands and the end zone.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a wide shot of a crowded football stadium during a game. The stands are packed with numerous spectators, predominantly dressed in purple and yellow. On the vibrant green field, marked with white yard lines and a large white \"N\" logo at the center, football players in white uniforms and helmets are positioned for a play. Another group of players in similar white uniforms stands along the sideline. As the camera pans to the right, a few spectators in the foreground become more prominent. We see the back of a person's head with short brown hair, wearing a red visor. To their right, a man with short, graying hair is seen in profile, wearing a dark baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, looking out at the field. Partially visible further away from him is a woman with long blonde hair.",
    "Motion": "The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing more of the crowded football stadium. The view shifts from the center of the field, where players are standing, to the right end zone, a goalpost, and a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD.\" The pan also brings several spectators in the foreground into the frame.",
    "Scene": "A level-angle, panning shot captures a wide view of a crowded American football stadium, Ryan Field, on an overcast day. The green turf is marked with white yard lines, a large white \"N\" logo at midfield, and the word \"WILDCATS\" in the end zone. Football players in white and dark uniforms are positioned on the field. The stands are packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
