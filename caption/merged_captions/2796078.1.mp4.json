  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a woman with curly brown hair tied back with a clip, wearing a beige jacket, holding a small dog with curly fur and a floral bandana, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. The camera is at her level, capturing her from the chest up with a shallow depth of field that initially focuses on her and the dog. As she begins to walk to the left, gradually moving out of the frame, the camera moves slightly from right to left with some unsteadiness and shaking. Once the woman exits the frame, the shot transitions to a wider view of the outdoor café setting, revealing wooden tables and chairs arranged on a stone patio. The wooden chairs and tables occupy the middle ground, scattered across the center and right side of the frame. In the background, greenery and a building with large windows fill the upper portion of the frame. The decorative wooden panel with a geometric pattern is located in the top center, while potted plants and trees are situated in the top left and right areas. The transition from the initial medium close-up to the wider shot occurs smoothly as the woman exits the frame, revealing more of the outdoor setting. The environment is lush with greenery, including potted plants and trees, creating a natural and inviting atmosphere. A cluster of foliage sits behind a large window, adding depth to the scene. The café's architecture includes a decorative wooden panel with a geometric pattern. The overall ambiance is relaxed and casual, with a focus on the harmonious blend of natural elements and simple, rustic furniture. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the original subject.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
