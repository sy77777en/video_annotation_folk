  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low angle, featuring a static, time-lapse video that keeps the entire scene in sharp detail. In the middle ground, a small, white research station with antennas and a satellite dish is positioned at the center of the frame, flanked by evergreen trees on the left and right, and surrounded by deep snow. Piles of snow occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The background is filled with the clear night sky, where the dense, glowing band of the Milky Way stretches across the upper frame. A vibrant aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, is the primary moving element; it begins as a prominent green arc in the top left and a fainter red-hued band in the top right, and proceeds to shift and dance across the entire upper portion of the sky in a time-lapse sequence. The aurora's colors appear as green and red simultaneously as it moves dynamically across the star-filled night sky, creating a breathtaking cosmic display. The immense scale and atmosphere of the natural light show in the sky are emphasized by the remote, snowy landscape, with the research station serving as a point of reference.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video shot from a low, eye-level angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the snowy building in the middle ground to the aurora-filled sky, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video is an astronomical time-lapse scenery shot capturing a spectacular celestial event in a remote, snowy landscape. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural light show in the sky, with a small, white research station serving as a point of reference. A vibrant aurora borealis, with prominent green and subtle red hues, dances in a massive, shifting arc across the star-dusted heavens. The dense, glowing band of the Milky Way is also visible, stretching across the sky alongside the dynamic aurora, creating a breathtaking cosmic display.",
    "Motion": "This time-lapse video captures the vibrant aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, dancing across a star-filled night sky. In the middle ground, a small, white building with satellite dishes is set in a snowy, remote landscape surrounded by evergreen trees. The aurora's colors appear as green and red simultaneously as it moves across the sky, with the Milky Way also visible.",
    "Scene": "In a remote, snowy landscape at night, a white, rectangular building with antennas and a satellite dish is surrounded by evergreen trees and deep snow. Above, the clear night sky is filled with stars, revealing the Milky Way. A large, dynamic aurora borealis arches across the sky, displaying vibrant green and red hues together as it moves.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
