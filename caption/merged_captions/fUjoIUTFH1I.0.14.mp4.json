  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, static shot of a foggy street scene, captured from an eye-level perspective. The cracked asphalt street occupies the lower half and center of the frame, leading from the immediate foreground into the distant, fog-shrouded background where a large white building is faintly visible. A beige building with dark shutters lines the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. On the right, the front of a red car is positioned in the bottom right foreground, with a black convertible parked just behind it in the right middle ground next to a yellow building with a green door and a green wrought-iron balcony. Two red, octagonal STOP signs are posted in the middle ground on opposite sides of the street. While the focus is on the scenery, a few pedestrians are present; a group of three walks from right to left across the center of the street in the middle ground. Additionally, two more people are walking from right to left in the left middle ground. This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot from an eye-level, level perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene, from the foreground cars to the people crossing and the buildings in the distance, in sharp detail. The scene takes place on a narrow, cracked asphalt street on a very foggy day, likely in a historic district like New Orleans. The damp road is flanked by buildings; on the left is a beige stucco structure with dark shutters, and on the right is a yellow building with a green door and a green wrought-iron balcony. The dense fog obscures the view down the street, where a large white building is faintly visible. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment and the quiet, hazy atmosphere of the scene rather than on any specific individual or object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, foggy street in what appears to be a historic urban neighborhood. The cracked asphalt reflects the overcast sky, and a thick fog obscures the buildings in the distance, creating a moody and atmospheric quality. On the right, a black convertible and the front of a red car are parked along the curb, while on the left, two people walk along the sidewalk of a stucco building with dark shutters. A group of three people crosses the street in the middle distance, dwarfed by the surrounding architecture and the pervasive mist. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment and the quiet, hazy atmosphere of the scene rather than on any specific individual or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a static shot of a quiet, foggy city street, likely in a historic district like New Orleans. Parked cars line the wet, cracked road, and buildings with traditional architecture are visible on both sides. A few people are walking in the street and on the sidewalk, crossing an intersection from right to left.",

The dense fog obscures the view down the street, where a large white building is faintly visible. Two red, octagonal STOP signs are positioned on either side of the road. Under the right STOP sign, a black convertible sports car is parked in front of a red one. A few pedestrians are present, with a small group walking across the street in the middle of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
