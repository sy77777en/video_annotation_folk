  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a hand-held paper cutout of a character positioned centrally against a 2D animated scene. The character is a simple black line drawing on white paper, depicting a figure with a round face, two dot eyes, a wide grin, and spiky hair with a small leaf-like shape on top, attached to a wooden stick. The scene features a solid green area on the left and a light blue field with various green shapes on the right, including rounded hills, a flower outline, and other geometric forms. In the top right, a small red circle is stationary at the top edge of a green, hilly shape. The cutout partially covers the action behind it. The entire scene, including the red ball and green shapes, scrolls upward, simulating the camera tracking the character's movement along a path. The cutout remains mostly centered with slight hand-held movements, while the camera maintains a straight-on view of the flat scene. A hand-held paper cutout is moved downward with a shaky and unsteady motion along a green path, following the same fast-moving route as an orange creature on the left side of the frame. The green environment and the red ball remain stationary, while the orange creature moves downward on the left side of the frame. In a side-view perspective, the slightly shaky camera moves downward, following the paper puppet as it descends. The animated scene, which resembles a video game, features a small red ball visible on a green path. A paper-cut artwork moves downward along the same path, following the fast-moving trajectory of a small orange creature on the left side of the frame.",

This cutout is attached to a wooden stick. In the animated scene, which resembles a video game, a small red ball is visible on a green path.

    "Scene": "An animated scene with a simple, graphic style features a solid green area on the left and a light blue field on the right. The blue area is populated with various green shapes, including rounded hills, a flower outline, and other geometric forms. A small red circle is stationary at the top edge of a green shape. A hand-drawn paper cutout of a character with messy hair, held on a stick, moves side to side and downward across the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
