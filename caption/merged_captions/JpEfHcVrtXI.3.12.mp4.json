  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a dimly lit room, where a small, child-like figure in a bright yellow raincoat stands on the raised end of a tilted wooden seesaw, positioned centrally in the frame and occupying the foreground. The wooden dresser is located to the left in the middle ground, with some drawers ajar, and several wooden toy blocks scattered on the floor in front of it. A simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. Initially, the camera is at the subject's height, capturing the scene from a level perspective. The small figure, entirely covered by the raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that obscures its face, holds a small, lit lighter, which is the only significant light source, casting a glow that illuminates the character while leaving the surrounding area in deep shadow. As the figure walks from the center of the seesaw towards the raised end on the right side, the camera smoothly tracks the glowing yellow character from the side, tilting up and down to follow the motion. As the figure reaches the elevated end, it begins to lower until it touches the ground. The camera transitions to a higher position above the subject, providing a broader view of the room and emphasizing the spatial arrangement of the elements. The figure then jumps off the seesaw onto the ground. A thick, dark pipe runs along the top of the back wall, adding to the dark, atmospheric setting. The deep focus keeps the entire room in sharp detail, highlighting the aged appearance of the objects within the shadowy space.",

    "Camera": "This video features a smooth camera that tracks a small, glowing yellow character from the side as it moves to the right. The camera tilts up and down to follow the character's motion, shifting from a level to a high-angle perspective. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire dark, atmospheric room in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A small, child-like figure stands on the raised end of a tilted wooden seesaw. The figure is entirely covered by a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face. It holds a small, lit lighter, which illuminates the character. Also visible are a worn wooden dresser with some drawers ajar, several wooden toy blocks on the floor, and a simple wooden swing hanging in the background. The objects appear aged and are set within a very dark, shadowy space.",
    "Motion": "A small figure in a yellow raincoat walks from the center of a wooden seesaw toward the raised end on the right side. As the figure reaches the elevated end, it begins to lower until it touches the ground. The figure then jumps off the seesaw onto the ground.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character is visible on screen, takes place in a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a wooden plank floor. A thick, dark pipe runs along the top of the back wall. To the left is a wooden chest of drawers with some drawers open, and several toy blocks are scattered on the floor in front of it. In the center of the room, a small figure in a yellow raincoat holding a light stands on the raised end of a wooden seesaw. To the right, a simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling. The only significant illumination comes from the character's light, casting a small glow and leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
