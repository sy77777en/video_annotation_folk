  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a white man with a dark beard and mustache is positioned in the center-left middle ground, facing right, wearing a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with a patch that reads \"G-25\". He is speaking directly to a woman, whose back is to the camera, with blonde hair tied up in a bun and wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The back of her head and shoulder occupy the right foreground. The scene is set in a dimly lit, dark environment at night, with the background indistinct and shrouded in darkness. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and performs a very smooth, minor pan from left to right, causing the woman's head and neck to enter the frame from the right side. The man moves his mouth as he speaks, his head and facial features shifting slightly, maintaining a serious expression. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the midground in focus. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays subtitles that read, \"Price: Hadir's yours. Intel's mine.\"",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the midground in focus. The camera performs a very smooth, minor pan from left to right.",
    "Subject": "A white man with a dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up, speaking to a woman. He wears a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with a patch that reads \"G-25\". The woman, seen from over her shoulder, has blonde hair tied up in a bun and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The man is facing her, with a serious expression on his face.",
    "Motion": "A man with a beard moves his mouth as he speaks directly to a woman, whose back is to the camera. His head and facial features shift slightly as he talks.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set in a dimly lit, dark environment at night. A man wearing a dark green beanie and a green tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch is visible, speaking. The back of another person's head and shoulder, wearing a light-colored shirt, is visible in the right foreground, while the background is indistinct and shrouded in darkness.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
