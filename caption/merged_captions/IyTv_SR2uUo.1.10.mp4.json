  "merged_caption": "From a locked-on perspective, the top of a purple wingsuit with black accents and a black helmet are fixed in the immediate foreground at the top center of the frame. Initially, a large, jagged, light-brown rock formation with a distinct natural arch is positioned at the center bottom of the frame in the middle ground, with a vast mountain range and a deep, verdant valley visible in the background. The surrounding landscape features steep, jagged mountains with a mix of grey rock faces and green, grassy slopes, while snow-capped peaks are visible under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera, mounted to the body of the person in the wingsuit, captures the rapid descent through the high-altitude mountain range, maintaining a high angle and deep focus to keep the entire mountainous landscape sharp. As the camera moves rapidly forward, the rock arch grows in size until the flyer passes directly through it, with the rock walls briefly occupying the left and right sides of the frame in the immediate foreground. During this motion, the camera performs a clockwise roll, causing the Dutch angle to vary. After clearing the arch, the view opens up again to the valley and mountains in the middle ground and background, while the wingsuit and helmet remain fixed at the top center of the frame. The camera is positioned from the subject's point of view, looking forward and down into the valley, capturing the dynamic motion as the person continues to descend through the mountain valley.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, body-mounted aerial perspective, the camera captures a wingsuit flyer in flight. It maintains a high angle, moving forward while performing a clockwise roll, which causes the Dutch angle to vary. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire mountainous landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person is seen wearing a purple wingsuit with black accents and two zippers running down the chest. The top of their black helmet is visible at the top center of the view. The camera is locked onto the body as the person flies directly towards and then through a large, jagged, light-brown rock formation with a distinct natural arch in its center.",
    "Motion": "A person in a wingsuit flies directly toward a large rock formation with a natural arch, with the camera locked onto their body. The person then passes through the arch and continues to descend through a mountain valley.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed, the scene captures a rapid descent through a high-altitude mountain range. The flight path moves directly toward and through a narrow gap in a prominent, weathered rock arch. The surrounding landscape features steep, jagged mountains with a mix of grey rock faces and green, grassy slopes. In the distance, snow-capped peaks are visible under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. Far below, a deep, verdant valley can be seen. The purple fabric of a wingsuit and a black helmet are visible at the top of the view, framing the fast-moving scenery.",
    "Spatial": "From a locked-on perspective, the top of a wingsuit and helmet are fixed in the immediate foreground at the top center of the frame. Initially, a large rock formation with a central arch is positioned at the center bottom of the frame in the middle ground, with a vast mountain range and a deep valley visible in the background. The camera moves rapidly forward, causing the rock arch to grow in size until the flyer passes directly through it, with the rock walls briefly occupying the left and right sides of the frame in the immediate foreground. After clearing the arch, the view opens up again to the valley and mountains in the middle ground and background, while the wingsuit and helmet remain fixed at the top center of the frame. The camera is positioned from the subject's point of view, looking forward and down into the valley."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
