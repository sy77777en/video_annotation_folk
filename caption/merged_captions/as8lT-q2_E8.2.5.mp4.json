  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a young woman with fair skin and short, blonde hair in the center foreground. She is wearing a black and white striped t-shirt layered under a black bomber jacket with a white collar. Her eyes are wide and her mouth is slightly open, conveying an expression of surprise or apprehension as she looks slightly upward and to her right. The scene takes place indoors at night within a dimly lit establishment, characterized by a vibrant, high-contrast color scheme. In the background, a large blue neon sign shaped like a city skyline is positioned in the right-center, with pink neon tubes extending diagonally across the top right. Reddish-brown booths occupy the bottom right middle ground, while metallic fixtures are visible in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. The woman walks forward, facing forward with her gaze directed slightly upward and to her right. The camera, at eye level, smoothly moves backward, slightly tilting upward while maintaining a level-angle perspective. It leads the woman as she walks forward, keeping her in sharp focus with a shallow depth of field, while the neon-lit background remains blurred.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
