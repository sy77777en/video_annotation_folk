  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a Japanese street scene, captured from a first-person POV at eye level with a level angle, deep focus, and a large depth of field. A prominent traditional-style building occupies the center-right portion of the frame, situated primarily in the middle ground and extending slightly into the background. To its right, in the foreground and middle ground, stands a maple tree with vibrant red leaves. The street and sidewalk stretch across the bottom of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Various groups of people populate the scene: schoolgirls in dark uniforms are clustered in the center-left middle ground near the building's entrance, two women in patterned red kimonos stand in the center-right middle ground near shop displays, and other pedestrians, some wearing face masks, walk along the street in the foreground and middle ground. Other buildings line the street in the left middle ground and background, while distant hills are visible in the top-left background under a partly cloudy sky. The camera smoothly pans right while slightly moving forward, beginning with a view of the street lined with traditional Japanese buildings. As the camera moves forward, it focuses on the two women in kimonos standing and talking in front of the shop, which has various signs and advertisements displayed outside, including images of food items. The presence of colorful signage and displays outside shops further emphasizes the dynamic urban environment. The camera continues to move forward, maintaining a steady movement with minimal shaking, capturing the blend of tradition and modernity in this vibrant and lively ambiance, creating a rich, immersive experience. The sky appears overcast, adding to the atmospheric setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
