  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium full shot with a person in an orange, ribbed spacesuit with a green helmet that has a clear visor, initially centered in the foreground. A yellow, box-like apparatus is attached to the front of the suit at chest level, connected by black straps. The person wears green gloves and interacts with a wall panel covered in protruding buttons in navy, yellow, and green. To their right, a wall panel with various buttons extends from the foreground to the midground. Large, angled, segmented windows that admit a pale, slightly pinkish light are visible in the background at the top of the frame, and other wall panels are on the left in the middle ground. The person, initially interacting with the right-hand wall panel, reaches out with their left hand and then turns their upper body counterclockwise towards the left wall, moving closer to the camera. As they turn, they appear larger and occupy the center of the frame. Consequently, the right-hand wall panel moves further to the right and recedes slightly, while the left-hand wall panels become more prominent in the middle ground. The windows remain in the background at the top. The camera, positioned at ground level, captures the person from a low angle and employs deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly rolls clockwise to track the person's movement as their right arm moves as if adjusting something or reaching. The scene is set indoors, within a room featuring white walls and large windows, with portions of the walls adorned with panels of small, protruding rectangular buttons colored navy, yellow, and green.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
