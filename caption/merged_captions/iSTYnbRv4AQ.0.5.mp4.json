  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing, point-of-view perspective on a moving train. The camera is positioned at eye level on an elevated vantage point, looking straight ahead along the railway. As the train moves rapidly forward, the camera maintains a level angle and deep focus, capturing the entire scene sharply. The wet railway tracks begin in the bottom foreground and extend into the background, occasionally curving towards the left. These tracks are flanked on the left and right by green, tree-covered hills in the middle ground and background, with some buildings visible among the trees on both sides. Additionally, some buildings occasionally pass by in the foreground as the camera moves. The bright, overcast sky is visible in the background at the top of the frame. When the train passes by a dim, overhanging structure, the scene is framed by the structure in the immediate foreground, which covers the top and sides of the shot. Small green lights are positioned on posts alongside the tracks near the overhanging structure. The camera moves forward quickly and very smoothly along the curved railway track, occasionally panning left to follow the turn. The combination of rapid motion and a greatly accelerated time-lapse effect creates a blur, causing the scenery on the periphery to blur heavily while the central path becomes streaked, creating a strong sense of depth and speed. The high speed of travel emphasizes the dynamic experience of rapid travel and the immersive atmosphere of the journey, with the rushing scenery and leading lines of the track highlighting the feeling of speed rather than focusing on a specific object.",

    "Camera": "This greatly accelerated time-lapse video captures a point-of-view shot from a train at eye level, maintaining a level angle. With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera moves forward quickly and very smoothly along a curved railway track, occasionally panning left to follow the turn.",
    "Subject": "This is a high-speed, point-of-view scenery shot from the front of a train, capturing the rapid movement of the train. During the movement, it passes through a dark, covered section of track into a bright, open landscape. The camera looks down a set of wet, reflective tracks that curve into the distance, flanked by lush green hills covered in dense trees. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the dynamic experience of rapid travel and the immersive atmosphere of the journey. The composition uses the rushing scenery and leading lines of the track to emphasize the feeling of speed rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view shot from a fast-moving train, where the combination of rapid motion and time-lapse effect creates a blur. The camera looks forward along wet tracks that curve through a lush, green landscape of trees and hills. Buildings are visible on both sides of the tracks and in the distance under a bright sky.",
    "Scene": "From the front of a fast-moving vehicle, the scene captures a forward-facing view along a set of brown, reflective railway tracks. The tracks are elevated and curve to the left through a landscape of green, tree-covered hills. Some buildings are visible in the distance and on both sides among the trees. The vehicle passes under a dim, overhanging structure that frames the top and sides of the view. The high speed of travel, combined with a time-lapse effect, causes the periphery to be heavily blurred, while the central path of the tracks also becomes streaked. Ahead, the sky is bright and overcast. Small green lights are positioned on posts alongside the tracks near the overhanging structure.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing, point-of-view perspective on a moving train. When the train passes by a dim, overhanging structure, the scene is framed by the structure in the immediate foreground, which covers the top and sides of the shot. In the center, wet railway tracks begin in the bottom foreground and extend into the background, occasionally curving towards the left. These tracks are flanked on the left and right by green, tree-covered hills in the middle ground and background, with some buildings visible among the trees on both sides. Additionally, some buildings occasionally pass by in the foreground as the camera moves. The bright, overcast sky is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera moves rapidly forward, following the curve of the tracks. Together with the time-lapse effect, this causes the scenery on the periphery to blur heavily while the central path becomes streaked, creating a strong sense of depth and speed. The camera is positioned at eye level on an elevated vantage point, looking straight ahead along the railway."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
