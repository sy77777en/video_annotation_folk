  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a woman with brown hair pulled back into a bun, positioned in the background at the center of a long, narrow residential hallway with white walls and light-colored wood plank flooring. She is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-down pajama shirt with a plaid pattern and walks barefoot towards the camera, moving from the background to the middle ground, causing the framing to transition into a medium shot. As she approaches the end of the hall, she raises her left arm toward a white light switch on the wall at the corner of the hall. She stops in the center-right of the frame and turns her head and torso to her left, which corresponds to the right side of the frame, to look into a dark doorway. As she turns the light off, a tall, slender, silhouetted figure is revealed standing motionless inside the doorway, positioned in the background on the left side of the frame. A wooden door occupies the left foreground throughout the shot, and the right wall is adorned with a few framed pictures. The camera remains static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire hallway sharp and in view. At the far end of the corridor, another doorway opens into a separate space, and the silhouetted figure stands motionless in the unlit space.",

    "Subject": "A woman with brown hair pulled back into a bun walks barefoot down a hallway. She is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-down pajama shirt with a plaid pattern.

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a long, narrow residential hallway with white walls and light-colored wood plank flooring. On the left, a closed wooden door is visible. The right wall is adorned with a few framed pictures, and a white light switch is located on the white wall at the corner of the hall. At the far end of the corridor, another doorway opens into a separate space. A woman wearing a plaid nightshirt walks from the back of the hallway toward the camera. She stops and turns to her left, looking into a doorway just as the light within that room extinguishes, revealing a dark, silhouetted figure standing in the unlit space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
