  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, with the camera positioned below the subjects. Initially, a person wearing a yellow helmet, a black long-sleeved top, and black pants is captured taking off to perform a backflip on a black bicycle in the middle ground of the frame, on a high, light-colored rocky ridge. The cyclist performs the backflip in mid-air, then lands on a steep, light brown, rocky slope and rides downwards. Two observers are visible in the bottom right of the frame, positioned further down the steep, brown mountainside, also in the middle ground. One observer, positioned lowest, wears a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, while the second, slightly above and to the left, wears a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and khaki pants. These two individuals appear to be observing the cyclist. The expansive, rugged, and layered mountainside, characterized by steep, layered rock formations in shades of brown and tan, dominates the background and extends into the middle ground. Sparse, dry, greenish-brown vegetation dots the landscape. As the cyclist completes the trick and descends the steep slope, the camera, in slow motion, smoothly tilts down and pans right, tracking the mountain biker while maintaining a deep focus to keep both the biker and the expansive landscape sharp. The camera angle shifts to a more level perspective, keeping the cyclist largely centered in the middle ground. The observers' position in the frame shifts slightly more towards the center and higher as the camera moves, although they remain stationary on the mountainside. The scene captures an outdoor setting on a rugged, arid mountainside during what appears to be daytime.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a yellow helmet, a black long-sleeved top, and black pants performs a backflip on a black bicycle down a steep, light brown, rocky slope. Further down the slope, to the right, two other people are visible. One, positioned lowest, wears a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark pants.

    "Motion": "A cyclist performs a backflip in mid-air, then lands on a steep, light brown, rocky slope and rides downwards. Further down the slope, two observers stand and watch the cyclist.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a rugged, arid mountainside characterized by steep, layered rock formations in shades of brown and tan. Sparse, dry, greenish-brown vegetation dots the landscape. During what appears to be daytime, a mountain biker is seen performing a trick on a high ridge before descending a steep, uneven slope. Two people are visible at the base of the incline, observing from below.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
