  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a dynamic cityscape at dusk, captured with mild barrel distortion. Initially, a tall building with reflective glass and red accents dominates the left side of the frame, extending from bottom to top in the foreground to middle ground. A large construction crane is positioned on the right in the foreground, silhouetted against a dramatic sky transitioning from teal to warm hues of orange and pink, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The drone, maintaining a smooth movement with minimal shaking, begins at an aerial level with a level camera angle and moves forward slightly over the city. The camera then executes a rapid clockwise rotation and appears to ascend, tilting upward to a worm's-eye view while ascending into the sky. As it moves, the building on the left exits the frame, and the crane initially on the right shifts to the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The surrounding cityscape is initially visible at the bottom of the frame and then shifts to the right side as the camera moves. The camera is positioned at the same height as the crane and the tall building, utilizing a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. Several large construction cranes, with their intricate metal lattice structures, are visible against the sky, enhancing the sense of scale and movement. The absence of a singular main subject emphasizes the overall urban environment, the atmospheric quality of the light and sky, and the immersive experience of the city's architecture and ambiance.",

    "Camera": "The video, captured with mild barrel distortion, begins at an aerial level with a level camera angle. The drone, maintaining a smooth movement with minimal shaking, moves forward slightly over the city at dusk. It then tilts upward to a worm's-eye view while ascending into the sky, utilizing a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, featuring a rotating perspective that sweeps across tall, modern buildings with reflective glass facades and prominent construction cranes silhouetted against a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a significant element, transitioning from a cool teal to warm hues of orange and pink, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The absence of a singular main subject is due to the shot's emphasis on the overall urban environment, the atmospheric quality of the light and sky, and the sense of scale and movement, which collectively create an immersive experience of the city's architecture and ambiance rather than focusing on any individual element.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a slightly distorted view of a cityscape at dusk. A tall building is visible on the left, and a large construction crane dominates the right side of the frame. The sky displays a mix of teal and warm sunset colors, and there is no discernible motion of the subjects.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic perspective of an urban construction site at sunset. A tall building with a red wall and glass windows initially appears on the right side of the frame and then exits as the camera moves. Several large construction cranes, with their intricate metal lattice structures, are visible against a teal sky tinged with vibrant pink and orange hues from the setting sun. The drone's movement creates a sense of rapid ascent and rotation, with the surrounding cityscape and cranes appearing to shift and blur.",
    "Spatial": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a dynamic cityscape. Initially, a tall building with reflective glass and red accents dominates the left side of the frame, extending from bottom to top in the foreground to middle ground. A large construction crane is positioned on the right in the foreground, silhouetted against the sky. The sky itself, with teal, orange, and pink hues, occupies the background. The camera then executes a rapid clockwise rotation and appears to ascend. As it moves, the building on the left exits the frame. The crane initially on the right shifts to the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The surrounding cityscape is initially visible at the bottom of the frame and then shifts to the right side as the camera moves. The camera is positioned at the same height as the crane and the tall building."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
