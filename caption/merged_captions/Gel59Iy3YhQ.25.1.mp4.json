  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a side-view perspective, level with the action on the ground, in a monochromatic, pixel-art depiction of a dense, urban street. Initially, a large metal gate occupies the center midground, set within a brick wall that stretches across the frame, bearing Cyrillic text. In the foreground, a crouched ninja, wearing a dark outfit with dark hair, is positioned on the right side of the ground. As the scene progresses, two SWAT trucks, with \"SWAT\" written in white capital letters on their sides, enter from each side, each carrying two or three SWAT officers in dark, bulky tactical gear and helmets. Simultaneously, a character with light-colored hair styled in twintails and a flying device on their back appears in the center left of the screen and moves horizontally along the top of the wall toward the center. The ninja and multiple SWAT officers converge in the foreground, with the ninja character leaping and moving left while engaging in combat, creating white, pixelated motion effects across the lower portion of the frame. The SWAT officers fall one by one, leaving the ninja in the center of the ground. At this point, the character with the flying device is directly above the ninja, who then jumps up to engage in battle with him. The camera exhibits significant shaking and instability, particularly noticeable when the character is moving. Behind the wall, multi-story buildings with East Asian-style roofs and numerous signs in Cyrillic create a crowded cityscape. A small food stall with a noodle bowl icon is visible on the right. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"PRESS TO EJECT\" next to a controller button icon.",

    "Subject": "In a black-and-white, pixelated scene, a small character resembling a ninja is depicted wearing a dark outfit with dark hair. This figure is positioned near several other characters who appear to be SWAT officers, identifiable by their dark, bulky tactical gear and helmets. In the center of the screen, a character with light-colored hair styled in twintails is piloting a flying vehicle. Also present are two armored trucks, rendered in the same pixelated style, with the word \"SWAT\" written in white capital letters on their sides. During the battle, the SWAT officers fall one by one.",
    "Motion": "In a pixelated, black-and-white scene, a ninja is positioned on the right side of the ground. As the scene unfolds, two SWAT trucks arrive from opposite directions, and several SWAT officers disembark from each vehicle. Concurrently, a character with light-colored hair and a flying device appears on the middle left of the screen, moving horizontally toward the center along the top of the wall. The ninja and several SWAT officers converge on the ground below to engage in combat. The ninja first moves to the right, eliminating the SWAT officer there, then jumps and moves to the left to defeat the SWAT officer on that side. Ultimately, all the SWAT officers are defeated, leaving the ninja in the center of the ground. At this point, the character with the flying device is directly above the ninja, who then jumps up to engage in battle with him.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a monochromatic, pixel-art depiction of a dense, urban street. The midground features a brick wall with a large, central metal gate bearing Cyrillic text. Behind this wall, multi-story buildings with East Asian-style roofs and numerous signs, also in Cyrillic, create a crowded cityscape. Two armored SWAT trucks are parked on either side of the gate, and a small food stall with a noodle bowl icon is visible on the right. Throughout the clip, small, pixelated characters move quickly across the scene. One character is floating along the top of the wall with a flying vehicle on his back, while other characters, including ninjas and many special police officers, engage in combat on the ground, creating white motion effects. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"PRESS TO EJECT\" next to a controller button icon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
