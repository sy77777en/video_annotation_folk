  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a mustard yellow jacket and dark pants, capturing him from the waist up. Positioned in the center of the middle ground, he holds a blue corded phone to his ear with his right hand while his left hand rests on the door frame. To the left of the frame, a vintage-style, light blue wall-mounted telephone adds a retro touch. The background includes a partially visible room with blinds letting in natural light, casting soft shadows. The narrow hallway with pale-colored walls is shown on both sides. A woman with a towel wrapped around her head, wearing light-colored clothing, is visible in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, effectively utilizing a shallow depth of field to keep the middle ground and background in focus, although the foreground and the blue telephone in the middle ground appear slightly blurred. The man, engaged in a conversation, then uses his left hand to close the door, and both individuals are no longer visible as the door shuts completely. The shot then shifts to a static view of the closed door, now centered in the frame, with the wall-mounted telephone remaining in the same position on the left side. The camera maintains its level position throughout, staying at the subject's height initially and then focusing solely on the door and surrounding area after the subject exits. The environment features pale-colored walls and a vintage-style, light blue wall-mounted telephone with a coiled cord, adding a retro element to the scene. The video depicts an indoor setting, specifically a narrow hallway with a light wood-colored door at the end.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a mustard yellow jacket and dark pants. He is holding a blue corded phone to his ear, standing in a doorway with one hand on the door frame, appearing to be engaged in a conversation. In the background, there is a woman with a towel wrapped around her head, wearing light-colored clothing. As the video progresses, the man closes the door, making him not visible in the frame.",
    "Motion": "A man is seen talking on a blue corded phone, holding it with his right hand near his left ear, while standing in a doorway. His left hand is on the door frame. A woman is standing in the background. The man then uses his left hand to close the door, and both individuals are no longer visible as the door shuts completely.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting, specifically a narrow hallway with a light wood-colored door at the end. The environment features pale-colored walls and a vintage-style, light blue wall-mounted telephone with a coiled cord, adding a retro element to the scene. Initially, the door is open, allowing a view of the blinds in the room beyond, with natural light filtering through and casting soft shadows. A man interacts with the telephone and subsequently closes the door, transitioning the scene to a quieter, empty hallway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
