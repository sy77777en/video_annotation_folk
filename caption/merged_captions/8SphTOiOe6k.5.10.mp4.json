  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a street-side sign in the center, displaying information about fortune telling, with part of a red bicycle visible on the left. The bicycle and sign booth are positioned in the foreground. The camera starts with a handheld, slightly shaky view at eye level, initially static and capturing a display board from a high angle. It then pans left while tilting up to a level view, revealing the entrance of a ramen restaurant in the middle ground, with a person walking out from the left side of the frame. As the camera continues to pan left, it reveals a glass display case filled with model food items, including bowls and plates of different dishes. A man in a dark shirt and mask is seen walking out of the door, leaving the shop. More people walking past the display case come into view, including a woman in a white dress and black boots, and another woman in a brown jacket and black shorts. The people are positioned in the middle ground, with some moving from the right to the left of the frame and some moving from the left to the right. The storefront with hanging lanterns is in the further middle ground, adding depth to the scene. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the video, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The environment features a small, traditional storefront with wooden elements and paper lanterns, creating an authentic cultural atmosphere. The scene captures a lively urban environment with a mix of modern and traditional elements, reflecting a typical day in a busy Japanese neighborhood.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
