The faceless figure, composed of flat, geometric planes, presents only the general form of a head and shoulders facing forward. In the foreground, several blurry images of fast food items, including hamburgers, a red carton of french fries, and a red cup, are scattered around the central figure, positioned at the center-top left, center-top right, center-bottom left, and center-bottom right of the frame. An overlay text in the bottom left corner reads \"[1,2]: McDonald's Germany.\" The low-polygon digital bust exhibits slight movement or shaking, while the surrounding blurry images of fast food items remain completely stationary throughout the video. The camera, positioned at a level angle, eye-level, smoothly and slowly moves backward, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the low-poly human figure in the midground.",

    "Subject": "A light gray, low-polygon digital bust of a person is positioned centrally. The figure, composed of flat, geometric planes, is faceless and lacks any detailed features such as hair or eyes, presenting only the general form of a head and shoulders facing forward. In front of this digital figure are several blurry, out-of-focus images of fast food items. These include multiple hamburgers, a red carton of french fries, and a red cup, all appearing to float in the space before the bust.",

    "Scene": "In an abstract, digital scene with a blurry gray background, a low-polygon, gray, faceless humanoid figure is positioned in the center. Several fast food items, including hamburgers, french fries, and a drink, appear to be floating in front of the figure. Text in the bottom left corner reads \"[1,2]: McDonald's Germany.\"",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a light gray, low-polygon digital bust is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. In the foreground, several blurry images of fast food items are scattered around the central figure, positioned at the center-top left, center-top right, center-bottom left, and center-bottom right of the frame. An overlay text is visible in the bottom left corner. The entire scene is set against a blurry gray background. The camera slowly pulls back while remaining positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
