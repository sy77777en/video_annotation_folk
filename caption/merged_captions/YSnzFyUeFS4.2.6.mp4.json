  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a street-level perspective: a white car is parked in the left middle ground, one man stands in the center-left middle ground, another man walks from the center middle ground towards the viewpoint, and a woman walks away in the right middle ground, with storefronts lining the right side of the street. The framing then incorporates a first-person view, as hands holding a black camera enter the extreme foreground, occupying the lower half of the screen. The camera's lens is positioned in the bottom-center foreground, pointed at the street, and its active LCD screen is also in the foreground, displaying the same scene. While the hands adjust the camera, the man who was approaching exits the video frame from the right side, and the woman moves further into the background. The camera is maintained at an eye-level, first-person perspective throughout, with a fixed Dutch angle and deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed but is slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The video presents a first-person view of a pair of light-skinned hands holding and adjusting a black camera with a visible lens and controls. The camera is directed at a sunlit city sidewalk where several individuals are present. A man with short, dark-colored hair, wearing a white tank top and dark pants, walks towards the viewpoint. A woman with light-colored hair, dressed in a grey top and dark pants, carrying a shoulder bag, walks in the opposite direction and is seen only from the back as she moves along the sidewalk. In the center-left of the screen, another man with dark hair, wearing a black t-shirt and dark shorts, stands near a parked white sedan. Storefronts, including one with a sign for \"Artistic PIZZA\" and another for \"ACE Hardware Benjamin Moore\", line the street, with long shadows cast by the bright sunlight.",

On the sidewalk, a man in a white tank top walks towards the camera's viewpoint, while a woman in a grey top walks away from it. Another man in a black t-shirt stands still near a parked white car.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a sun-drenched city street. Long shadows stretch across the sidewalk where several pedestrians are walking. On the left, a white car is parked along the curb. To the right, storefronts line the street, including one with a sign for \"Artistic PIZZA\" and another displaying \"OPEN\" with food advertisements. Brick buildings with fire escapes rise on both sides of the street, and trees provide some shade. In the foreground, a pair of hands holds and adjusts a camera, with its lens visible, framing the street scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
