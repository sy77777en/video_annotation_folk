  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a bright green Rose-ringed parakeet positioned in the center of the frame, perched on a dark, molded window frame. The parakeet, with a prominent, hooked, yellow beak and a distinct black ring encircling its neck with a yellow band just below it, is part of the foreground, while dense, green foliage fills the background. The scene is set on a bright, sunlit day, viewed from an indoor perspective looking out through the window. Initially, the parakeet faces forward, looking directly ahead, before it slowly turns its head to its left, pausing to reveal its profile and a dark eye with a light-colored iris. The bird then turns its head back toward the front before turning it to the left side again, observing its surroundings through the glass, while its body remains stationary throughout the video. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level, capturing the parakeet in a high-angle shot with a fixed but slightly unsteady focus, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The parakeet's vibrant green body and visible feet gripping the surface it is standing on are clearly in focus, emphasizing the bird's presence against the blurred backdrop.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle shot is captured with a fixed but slightly unsteady camera. The focus is on the green parrot in the foreground, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background.",
    "Subject": "A bright green Rose-ringed parakeet is shown in a full shot, perched on a window frame and looking through the glass. The bird has a prominent, hooked, yellow beak. A distinct black ring encircles its neck, with a yellow band just below it. The parakeet initially faces forward, looking directly ahead, before turning its head to the side to reveal its profile and a dark eye with a light-colored iris. Its body is a uniform vibrant green, and its feet are visible gripping the surface it is standing on.",
    "Motion": "A green parakeet, perched on a window frame, initially looks directly forward. It then slowly turns its head to its left, pausing to look to the side. The bird turns its head back toward the front before turning it to the left side again, looking around its environment while its body remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "From an indoor perspective looking out through a window, the scene is set on a bright, sunlit day with a background of dense, green foliage. A bright green parrot with a yellow beak and a dark ring around its neck is perched on the exterior of a dark, molded window frame. The parrot looks directly forward before turning its head from side to side, observing its surroundings through the glass.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a green parakeet positioned in the center of the frame, perched on a window frame. Both the parakeet and the dark window frame are part of the foreground. Green foliage fills the background. The parakeet, initially facing forward, turns its head to its left, shifting its profile to face the right side of the frame. It continues to look around before turning its head back toward the center, while its body remains stationary throughout the video. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
