  "merged_caption": "The video is a stop-motion animation featuring a claymation scene with a medium shot of a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone, positioned in the center of the frame. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest in a dimly lit room with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, initially zooming in smoothly on the girl before remaining static. The girl is in the foreground, facing slightly to the left, with the chest to her left in the middle ground. She picks up a golden pocket watch from the chest and holds it up to her face, examining it closely. Her facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile, indicating interest and satisfaction. The room's walls have circular cutouts that allow soft light to filter through, creating a cozy ambiance. The vintage lantern is positioned to the left of the chest, adding to the rustic setting. The overall color palette is earthy and muted, enhancing the intimate and nostalgic feel of the setting. The girl raises the watch higher, still smiling, maintaining focus on the object. The spatial composition emphasizes the intimate interaction between the girl and the chest's contents, with the camera's shallow depth of field keeping the focus on her. The scene is characterized by a sense of discovery and curiosity, with a focus on the interaction with the chest and its intriguing items. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking, capturing the girl's gentle smile as she continues to look at the watch, highlighting the intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
