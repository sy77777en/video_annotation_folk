  "merged_caption": "This video opens with an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a city harbor at dusk, filmed by a drone. Initially, a small section of beach is visible in the lower right corner, adding a touch of natural beauty. The foreground and middle ground are filled with dark, rippling water, where numerous fishing boats are scattered and clustered across the horizontal center of the frame. Some boats are anchored alone, while others are grouped together, gently bobbing on the water. As the camera slowly and smoothly ascends, offering an expanding view of the harbor, the beach section gradually disappears from view. The distribution of boats shifts: small boats become more prominent, docked near the harbor in the middle left, while others appear clustered in the lower left and middle right areas. In the background, a modern city skyline stretches across the horizon, featuring a prominent reddish-brown building on the left and a group of tall, light-colored skyscrapers on the right, rising against a pale, lightly clouded sky. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground boats to the distant buildings sharp. As the camera tilts upward, the skyline remains at a constant position in the frame, emphasizing the juxtaposition of traditional maritime life with contemporary architecture. The elevated, static perspective conveys the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban waterfront. The camera concludes with a slight pan to the left, enhancing the view of the water and the city, capturing the tranquil harbor against the backdrop of a modern metropolis.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, aerial-level shot taken from a level angle, looking out over a harbor toward a city skyline. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground boats to the distant buildings sharp. Throughout the video, the camera slowly and smoothly pedestals upward, concluding with a slight pan to the left, while keeping the skyline at a constant position in the frame.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing a tranquil harbor at dusk against the backdrop of a modern metropolis. At the start, a small section of beach is visible in the lower right corner of the frame, adding a touch of natural beauty to the scene. The foreground is a calm body of water dotted with numerous small fishing boats, some clustered in groups while others move slowly across the surface. As the camera tilts upward, the beach area disappears, revealing a prominent skyline in the distance. Several tall, sleek skyscrapers pierce the hazy, pale sky, emphasizing the juxtaposition of traditional maritime life with contemporary architecture. The elevated, static perspective conveys the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban waterfront.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a city harbor at dawn or dusk. The calm water is filled with numerous fishing boats, some clustered in groups and others anchored alone. In the background, a modern city skyline with several prominent skyscrapers rises against a hazy sky, creating a striking contrast between the traditional maritime activity and the urban development.\n\nThe camera slowly ascends, offering an expanding view of the harbor. All of the boats are stationary, gently bobbing on the water.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide view of a coastal city harbor at dusk. The scene features a large body of dark, rippling water dotted with numerous boats, many of which are clustered together in small groups and remain stationary on the water's surface. In the background, a modern city skyline with several tall, light-colored skyscrapers and a prominent reddish-brown building rises against a pale, lightly clouded sky. A curved coastline with a pier separates the water from the urban landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
