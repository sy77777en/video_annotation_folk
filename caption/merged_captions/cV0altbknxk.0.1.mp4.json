  "merged_caption": "This screen recording of video editing software displays a video preview window in the top half of the frame and control panels in the bottom half. Within the preview, a static, fast-motion close-up of a trench coat sleeve with a rectangular patch featuring a red and white Union Jack design and the word \"TRENCH\" in white is positioned prominently in the center foreground, while another part of the collar with a circular logo containing a red and blue design and a white letter 'R' inside is visible to the right in the middle ground. Initially, the bottom of the screen shows a Color Wheels panel on the left and a Scopes panel on the right. White digital tracking points appear around the patch in the preview window, subtly jiggling and adjusting their positions before transforming into blue crosses. The Color Wheels panel is then replaced by a Tracker-FX panel. A cursor clicks a \"track forward\" button in the software interface, initiating a forward tracking operation as indicated by a red playhead line moving from left to right across a timeline graph in the bottom-left panel. The camera filming the video of the trench coat moves towards the trench coat, enhancing the close-up view of the collar and upper sleeve. The interface features a Parade waveform scope displaying red, green, and blue channels, and the tracking tool is used to select the patch, with digital tracking points connected by blue crosses forming a rectangle that conforms to the patch's shape.",

    "Subject": "A close-up shot shows the collar and upper sleeve of a beige trench coat. A rectangular patch with a dark blue border is affixed to the upper sleeve by two black buttons. The patch features a red and white Union Jack flag design, with the word \"TRENCH\" embroidered in white across its center. Digital tracking points appear around the patch and are connected by blue crosses, forming a rectangle that conforms to the patch's shape. To the right, another section of the collar shows a circular logo with a red and blue design and a white letter 'R' inside.",

The interface features a video preview window, color wheels, and a Parade waveform scope displaying red, green, and blue channels. In the preview window, a close-up shot of a beige trench coat sleeve is being edited. The sleeve has a rectangular patch with a Union Jack design and the word \"TRENCH\" in white. A tracking tool is used to select this patch, and a forward tracking operation is initiated within the software's tracker panel.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
