  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a white golf ball is initially located in the bottom right foreground, flying toward a stationary, whole, oblong watermelon with a shiny, striped green rind, positioned in the center of the frame and resting atop a brown cardboard box with clear tape on its top flaps and a small yellow sticker on its side. The scene is set in an outdoor environment with a soft-focus background of green trees, brightly lit, and the camera remains static, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on the watermelon in the midground. As the golf ball strikes the watermelon, the video showcases a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to a slightly slower motion upon impact. The watermelon explodes from its center, with the green rind cracking and peeling back in several pointed, star-like sections, forming a jagged, star-shaped opening. Simultaneously, a spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, flying upwards and outwards in a cloud of small particles, sending a spray of pink flesh and pieces of white and green rind flying outward. The watermelon becomes the focus in the foreground as it breaks apart, revealing the bright red interior.",

    "Camera": "This video showcases a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to a slightly slower motion when the ball hits the watermelon. The camera remains static, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on the watermelon in the midground.",
    "Subject": "A whole, oblong watermelon with a shiny, striped green rind sits atop a brown cardboard box. A small, white golf ball flies toward it and makes contact. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. A spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, while the green rind peels back in several pointed, star-like sections, revealing the bright red interior.",
    "Motion": "A white golf ball flies toward a stationary watermelon resting on a cardboard box. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. The green rind cracks and peels back in several pointed sections, forming a star-like shape. Simultaneously, a spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, flying upwards and outwards in a cloud of small particles.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting with a soft-focus background of green trees, a whole watermelon with a green striped rind rests on a brown cardboard box. The scene is brightly lit. A golf ball strikes the watermelon, causing it to explode from the center, sending a spray of pink flesh and pieces of white and green rind flying outward. The force of the explosion creates a jagged, star-shaped opening in the top of the fruit. The cardboard box has clear tape on its top flaps and a small yellow sticker on its side.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a golf ball is initially located in the bottom right foreground. It then strikes a watermelon positioned in the center of the frame, resting on top of a cardboard box. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes from its center, with the rind peeling back and pulp spraying outward. The watermelon becomes the focus in the foreground as it breaks apart. The background is filled with out-of-focus green trees, and the camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
