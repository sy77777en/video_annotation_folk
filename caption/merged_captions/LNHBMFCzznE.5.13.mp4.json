  "merged_caption": "A medium shot shows a middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length, straight brown hair, wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern, standing in the center foreground. She is positioned against a large, vibrant blue backdrop composed of abstract, geometric shapes with sharp angles and intersecting planes, creating a modern and dynamic visual. The lighting is focused on the stage, making the blue background appear bright and saturated. The woman, wearing a delicate necklace with a small pendant and a hoop earring in her right ear, stands and speaks with a serious and engaged expression. A thin-wire microphone is positioned near her chin. She gestures with her hands, holding a small black object, possibly a presentation remote, in her right hand, while using her left hand to point and make other expressive motions to emphasize her speech. She occasionally turns her head and upper body from side to side as she addresses the audience. The camera captures this scene with a smooth, eye-level shot and a shallow depth of field that keeps the speaker in the foreground in focus. Initially, the camera remains static at the woman's level, but then it pans to the right to follow her movement, maintaining the medium shot as she continues to engage with the audience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
