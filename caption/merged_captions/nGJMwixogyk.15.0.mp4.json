  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a group of people approaching the camera from the foreground and middle ground center, eventually disappearing from the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire street scene sharp. It moves forward and slightly upward along a narrow outdoor street lined with small shops and traditional-style buildings under a clear blue sky in the late afternoon, gently trucking to avoid pedestrians and panning to adjust its facing. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Two women in kimonos are visible on the right side of the street, walking side by side from the middle ground toward the camera, and eventually exiting the frame on the right. The street is paved with textured stone and flanked by storefronts featuring awnings in shades of beige, orange, and yellow, with some displaying colorful merchandise and signs in Japanese. Shops and buildings line both sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth and leading lines that draw the viewer’s eye toward the background, where green hills are visible above the rooftops. Several people walk along the sunlit street, moving in both directions. Some pause briefly to look at shop displays or interact with items near storefronts, while others continue walking at a steady pace. In the final scene, the hills transition to the middle ground as the perspective shifts, while the blue sky remains in the background throughout. Near the end of the video, a man in a patterned shirt is visible further along the street, entering the frame from the left foreground. The overall setting is brightly lit with warm sunlight, and the scene captures a sense of movement and daily activity.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire street scene sharp. It moves forward and slightly upward along the road, gently trucking to avoid pedestrians and panning to adjust its facing. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a man in yellow clothing on the far right, wearing a towel on his head and a mask. As the camera moves forward, he exits the frame. Initially, a man and a woman walk towards the camera in the center; the woman on the left wears a white dress and a mask, while the man on the right is in a black top with a white pattern and dark pants. He exits the frame from the left side. Behind them, a man in a black short-sleeved shirt and blue shorts pushes a stroller with a young girl, accompanied by a woman in black clothing and green pants, also wearing a mask. Further back, two women holding umbrellas walk towards the camera. After they exit the frame from the left, two women in kimonos appear, walking side by side on the right side of the street. As the camera continues forward, the street becomes less crowded, with only a few pedestrians visible.",
    "Motion": "Several people walk along a sunlit street lined with shops, moving in both directions. In the foreground, a group of two individuals walks together toward the camera, while others stroll individually or in pairs further down the street. Some people pause briefly to look at shop displays or interact with items near storefronts, while others continue walking at a steady pace. The overall motion consists of pedestrians moving leisurely along the street, occasionally stopping or changing direction as they navigate the area.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow outdoor street lined with small shops and traditional-style buildings under a clear blue sky in the late afternoon. The street is paved with textured stone and flanked by storefronts featuring awnings in shades of beige, orange, and yellow, with some displaying colorful merchandise and signs in Japanese. The buildings are constructed from wood and concrete, with sloped roofs and a mix of natural and painted finishes. Shadows stretch across the ground, indicating the low angle of the sun. In the background, green hills rise behind the buildings, and as the perspective gradually moves closer, the hills transition from the background to the middleground, becoming more prominent in the scene. The overall setting is brightly lit with warm sunlight. People walk along the street, some carrying bags or umbrellas, and their placement adds a sense of movement and daily activity to the setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a group of people approaching the camera from the foreground and middle ground center, eventually disappearing from the left side of the frame. Two women in kimonos are visible on the right side of the street, walking side by side from the middle ground toward the camera, and eventually exiting the frame on the right. The camera moves forward along the street with noticeable shaking, causing the foreground subjects to shift out of view while middle and background elements gradually become more prominent, moving toward the camera. Shops and buildings line both sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth and leading lines that draw the viewer’s eye toward the background, where green hills are visible above the rooftops. In the final scene, the hills transition to the middle ground as the perspective shifts, while the blue sky remains in the background throughout.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
