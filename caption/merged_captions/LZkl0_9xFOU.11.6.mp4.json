  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames an animated boy without visible facial features in the center-left of the foreground. He is depicted from the chest up, with short, styled brown hair, wearing a white t-shirt that appears greenish due to the room's green lighting. The boy sits in a dark green chair, turned slightly to his right, holding a green mobile phone with a dark outline to his right ear with his right hand, his head tilted down as if listening intently. His arms have visible joints at the elbow and wrist, giving him a mannequin-like appearance. He remains completely still, seated at a wooden desk that occupies the right side of the foreground, with two pieces of electronic equipment on it: one with a grid of buttons and small red lights, and another slightly angled to the right. In the background, a dark wooden cabinet with glass frames on the upper part of its doors stands against the green wall on the right, while a blank white rectangle with a small triangular section missing is mounted on the left wall. A hanging lamp is visible in the top left corner. The camera starts at an eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the person in the foreground. It performs a slightly unsteady crane shot, moving upward in an arc, which transitions the view from a level to a high angle. White subtitles are positioned in the lower left corner of the screen, displaying \"[27]\". The scene is illuminated by a strong green light cast from an unseen source and the single hanging lamp, creating a unique atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
