  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman on the left and a man on the right, both positioned in the foreground. The woman has dark hair styled in an updo held back by a purple headband, fair skin, and wears a purple dress with a white high collar and silver buttons. The man is bald on top with dark hair on the sides, a short dark beard, and wears a khaki suit jacket over a lighter khaki vest, a white collared shirt, and a burgundy tie. In the background, a small painting is centered in the camera's frame, with a larger painting to its right. Dark wood wainscoting is visible at the bottom of the frame. The indoor scene is set within a room featuring light-colored walls and dark wood wainscoting. On the wall, two landscape paintings in dark wooden frames are visible, depicting outdoor scenes in muted, earthy tones. The space is evenly lit by a warm, artificial light source. The man in the suit speaks, moving his mouth and gesturing with both hands, while the woman in the purple dress stands opposite him, remaining still as she listens. This is a level, eye-level shot with a deep focus that keeps both the man and woman in the scene sharp. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the two characters as they converse.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
