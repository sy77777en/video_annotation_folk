  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat, capturing its upper body and head prominently in the frame. The kitten occupies the center of the image initially, with its head positioned slightly towards the top right. It rests on a flat, black, textured surface, possibly a suitcase, located in the foreground. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a calm, quiet atmosphere. The background features blurred, muted colors, indicating walls or furniture, but lacks distinct details. The kitten's front paw extends forward, hanging off the edge of the surface. As the video progresses, the kitten slowly moves towards the left side of the frame, gently sliding down the rounded edge of the black surface. The kitten stretches its right front paw towards the camera, then begins to slide down the edge of the surface. Its head is slightly tilted, and its ears are pointed and upright, with whiskers visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The camera maintains a steady position at the kitten's level, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the kitten within the frame, aside from its gradual movement to the left. The overall posture and expression convey a sense of calm and restfulness. The video features a static camera at a level angle, focusing on the sleeping cat in the foreground with an extremely shallow depth of field. The overall composition conveys a sense of tranquility and stillness, with the kitten's relaxed posture as the central focus.",

    "Subject": "The video features a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat. The kitten is resting on a flat, black surface, possibly a cushion or bag.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
