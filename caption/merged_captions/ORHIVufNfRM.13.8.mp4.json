  "merged_caption": "The video offers a first-person perspective of an underwater scene, with the camera positioned at the diver's eye level, creating an immersive experience. In the initial frame, two large rock formations are visible: one on the left side and another on the right side, extending into the center, dominating the middle ground. Smaller glowing creatures float in the foreground, adding depth. The vibrant flora, illuminated in shades of green and blue, is scattered throughout the middle ground and background, enhancing the scene's complexity. The camera starts with a high angle, shifts to a level angle, and returns to a high angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly forward while initially tilting upward, then continues its forward motion while panning left to explore the underwater environment. As the video progresses, the diver's hands become visible in the foreground, consistently moving from the center outward, suggesting an effort to propel forward while swimming. A spiky blue object initially appears in the middle ground on the right side and gradually shifts to the foreground on the right side of the frame before eventually disappearing from view. The camera maintains a steady height, allowing for a clear view of the underwater landscape, while an overlay effect resembling a diving mask frames the scene, subtly tinging the edges with red and black. The overall composition shifts slightly as the diver navigates through the environment, revealing more of the luminous flora and fauna in the middle ground and background. The sandy seabed is dotted with patches of seaweed and small, luminescent clusters, and the water is clear, allowing for a wide view of the underwater landscape. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and serene, with the interplay of light and shadow creating a captivating visual experience.",

    "Camera": "The video features a first-person perspective of a diver in a 3D video game. The camera is underwater, starting with a high angle, shifting to a level angle, and returning to a high angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly forward while initially tilting upward, then continues its forward motion while panning left to explore the underwater environment.",
    "Subject": "The video presents an underwater scene viewed from a first-person perspective, as if through the eyes of a diver. The surroundings are partially obscured by the diver's mask, enhancing the immersive experience. Large, towering rock formations and pillars are covered in luminescent flora, casting a soft glow in shades of green and blue. Small, glowing creatures or particles float gently through the water, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Initially in the background, a distinct, spiky, blue object or creature gradually approaches the camera as the diver swims forward, eventually exiting the frame from the lower right corner. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and serene, with the interplay of light and shadow creating a captivating visual experience.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of an underwater environment, featuring large rock formations and glowing flora. The camera moves forward, revealing more of the underwater landscape, including floating particles and a glowing blue object in the distance. As the camera continues to move, the glowing flora and particles remain visible, and the diver's hands can be seen moving from the center to the sides, propelling the diver forward and to the left. The camera then pans left, but the glowing blue object disappears from the right side of the frame, leaving only floating particles and some fish visible. The video concludes with the underwater environment in view, highlighting the distinct spiky features of the landscape against the backdrop of the underwater scene.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, exploring an underwater environment. The setting is a vibrant, alien-like ocean floor, featuring towering rock formations and scattered coral structures. The scene is illuminated by bioluminescent marine life, casting a soft glow across the surroundings. Various aquatic plants and creatures, some glowing in shades of green and blue, add to the otherworldly atmosphere. The sandy seabed is dotted with patches of seaweed and small, luminescent clusters. The water is clear, allowing for a wide view of the underwater landscape. Overlay elements include a red framing at the top and bottom of the screen, suggesting a helmet or visor, enhancing the immersive experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
