  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot from a vehicle-mounted point-of-view, the silver, mud-caked roll cage of the camera vehicle occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A tan off-road race truck with a boxy body and red and black accents, featuring the word \"TOYOTA\" in white on its front panel, is positioned in the middle ground, initially centered as it drives along a wide, brown dirt track under a clear blue sky. The camera, mounted on the rear of a race car, captures the truck following closely behind, racing beneath a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written in white text. As the truck moves toward the archway, it launches into the air, rising vertically in the center of the frame before descending and continuing to move toward the camera. The camera's angle, influenced by the car's movement, begins as a high angle while the car ascends a slope, transitions to a level angle, and then to a low angle as it descends, maintaining a deep focus on the entire dirt track and the car ahead. Several tall, purple, teardrop-shaped flags with \"COOPER\" branding are visible on the right side of the track before the archway. Green, grassy hills and scattered trees form both the middle ground and background, with tents and other structures visible in the distance. The camera remains at the truck's level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic motion as the truck, heavily caked in brown mud, continues to drive straight ahead after landing back on the track. The camera moves backward smoothly with minimal shaking, occasionally shifting to both sides, and exhibits mild barrel distortion due to its hip-level mounting.",

    "Camera": "This point-of-view shot is captured from a hip-level camera mounted on the rear of a race car, resulting in mild barrel distortion. As the car moves forward, the camera moves backward smoothly with minimal shaking, occasionally shifting to both sides. The camera's angle, which has a varying Dutch angle caused by the camera rolling and influenced by the car shaking, begins as a high angle while the car ascends a slope, transitions to a level angle, and then to a low angle as it descends. A deep focus keeps the entire dirt track and the car ahead in sharp view.",
    "Subject": "This video, filmed from a fixed point of view mounted on the rear of a race vehicle, shows a tan off-road race truck driving on a dirt track. The truck, heavily caked in brown mud, features a boxy body with red and black accents and the word \"TOYOTA\" written in white on its front panel. In the foreground, the silver, tubular metal roll cage of the camera vehicle is visible. The truck drives toward and jumps under a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written across it in white lettering. Several tall, purple, teardrop-shaped flags on poles are positioned along the side of the track before the archway.",
    "Motion": "A fixed point-of-view camera mounted on the rear of a race vehicle captures a tan off-road race truck following closely behind. The truck races beneath a large purple archway, launches into the air, and then descends to land back on the dirt track, continuing to drive straight ahead.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a vehicle, the scene captures a race on a wide, brown dirt track under a clear blue sky during the daytime. The track is flanked by green, grassy hills and scattered trees, with tents and other structures visible in the distance. A mud-splattered race car is seen from the front as it speeds along the track before launching into the air as it passes under a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written in white text. Several purple, teardrop-shaped flags with \"COOPER\" branding are positioned along the side of the course before the archway. A portion of the silver, mud-caked roll cage of the camera's vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot from a vehicle-mounted point-of-view, the silver, mud-caked roll cage of the camera vehicle occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A black and red race truck is positioned in the middle ground, initially centered as it drives along a dirt track. The camera follows the truck as it moves toward a large purple archway, which transitions from the foreground to the middle ground. As the truck passes under the archway, it launches into the air, rising vertically in the center of the frame before descending and continuing to move toward the camera. Several purple flags are visible on the right side of the track before the archway. Green hills and trees form both the middle ground and background. The camera remains at the truck's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
