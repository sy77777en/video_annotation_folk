  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of four people in a cozy, rustic living room with wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace. The man in a yellow patterned sweater vest over a white shirt and dark trousers is near the center-right of the frame. The woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white plaid dress, is slightly left of center, assisting a young girl with dark hair in a red hat and patterned dress, initially standing on the left side of the frame. The woman in a light yellow dress with a towel wrapped around her head enters later from behind the right wall, moving in front of the man in the yellow sweater. As the video progresses, all four individuals move quickly towards the camera, with the woman in the checkered dress leading into the foreground. The child becomes obscured by her, while the woman in the robe is partially visible behind them, and the man in the yellow sweater is visible only from the shoulders up. Throughout this movement, all four remain centered in the frame, with the woman in the checkered dress in the foreground and the others in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves smoothly backward, leading the group of people from the front with minimal shaking. In the background, a sofa with a blue-green plaid blanket, a decorative painting, and a floor lamp are visible on the left side of the frame, contributing to the warm, inviting atmosphere enhanced by natural light and soft, orange glows from the lamps.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
