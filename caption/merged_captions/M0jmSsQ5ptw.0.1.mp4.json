  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm, adorned with a yellow wristband and clad in a black and white vertically striped sleeve, occupies the bottom left foreground, looking down upon a vast, paved area on a sunny day. The ground, composed of cracked concrete slabs with yellow painted lines, is set up with various ramps and obstacles. In the middle ground, a large blue quarter-pipe is positioned on the left next to a white building, a circular landing target with a white outer ring and a black center is in the top center, and other smaller black and blue ramps are scattered across the center. The paved area is surrounded by dry, brown earth. As the perspective moves forward and descends, the arm exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute appears on the ground in the right side of the frame, moving towards the center and bottom as the viewpoint gets closer to the ground. The shadow travels across the concrete, moving towards the ramps, as the parachutist continues to descend toward the landing area. The entire scene on the ground shifts from the top of the frame towards the bottom due to the forward and downward movement. This video is filmed from a slightly unsteady, first-person point of view, showing a parachute landing. It features noticeable fisheye distortion, which curves straight lines. The camera begins at an aerial height with a bird's-eye view, descending to an overhead, high-angle perspective. During the descent, the camera briefly rolls counterclockwise and tilts up just before landing. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm, adorned with a yellow wristband and clad in a black and white vertically striped sleeve, is visible in the foreground. The view looks down upon a large, paved concrete area set up as an extreme sports course. The course includes a large blue quarter-pipe, a smaller blue and black ramp, several small black wedge ramps, and a circular landing target with a white outer ring and a black center. As the perspective moves, the distinct shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute is cast upon the ground, indicating that the viewpoint is that of a parachutist descending toward the course.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera descends and moves forward over a large, paved area configured as an extreme sports course. As the descent continues, the shadow of a person with a rectangular parachute becomes visible on the ground. The shadow travels across the concrete, moving towards the ramps, as the parachutist continues to descend toward the landing area.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down from a high altitude onto a vast, paved area on a sunny day. The ground, composed of cracked concrete slabs with yellow painted lines, is set up with various ramps and obstacles. On the left, a large blue ramp sits next to a white building. Other smaller black and blue ramps are scattered across the lot, along with a circular white landing target with a black center. The paved area is surrounded by dry, brown earth. As the perspective moves, the shadow of a person attached to a parachute becomes visible on the ground below.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm occupies the bottom left foreground, looking down upon a paved area that fills the frame. In the middle ground, a large blue ramp is positioned on the left, a circular target is in the top center, and other smaller ramps are scattered across the center. As the perspective moves forward and descends, the arm exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the shadow of a parachutist appears on the ground in the right side of the frame, moving towards the center and bottom as the viewpoint gets closer to the ground. The entire scene on the ground shifts from the top of the frame towards the bottom due to the forward and downward movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
