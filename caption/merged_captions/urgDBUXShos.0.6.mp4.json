  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a close-up, positioning the woman's profile on the left side of the frame and the man's profile on the right, with both subjects in the foreground. The man, with white face paint, smeared red lipstick, dark eye makeup, and messy, shoulder-length, greenish-yellow hair, wears a dark purple jacket and dark brown gloves. He uses his left hand to support the woman's neck while his right hand presses a small, sharp blade to her cheek. The woman, with brown hair styled in an updo, wears a dark green sleeveless top and has her head tilted back. In the background, blurred figures of other people are visible, suggesting a formal gathering in a large, dimly lit room. The camera, from a level, eye-level perspective, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the man, initially showing him on the right. As the camera moves behind the man, his back momentarily obscures the woman from view. The camera continues its rotation to his right side, settling into a medium close-up where the subjects' positions within the frame have swapped: the man is now on the left and the woman is on the right. Throughout this movement, a shallow depth of field keeps the focus sharply on them in the foreground, emphasizing the tension between the two central figures.",

    "Subject": "A man with white face paint, smeared red lipstick, dark eye makeup, and messy, shoulder-length, greenish-yellow hair stands in close proximity to a woman with brown hair styled in an updo. The man, wearing a dark purple jacket, uses his left hand, covered in a dark brown glove, to support the woman's neck while his right hand, also gloved in dark brown, presses a small, sharp blade to her cheek. The woman, wearing a dark green sleeveless top, has her head tilted back. The perspective shifts, circling around the man, initially showing him on the right and the woman on the left, before his back momentarily obscures her, and the view settles with the man on the left and the woman on the right.",
    "Motion": "The camera's perspective circles around a man holding a woman. Initially, the man is on the right, pressing a blade to the woman's cheek. The camera then moves behind the man, whose back momentarily obscures the woman, before settling into a new position where the man is on the left and the woman is on the right.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors within a large, dimly lit room. The background is intentionally blurred, revealing the indistinct silhouettes of numerous people, suggesting a formal gathering. In the foreground, a man with green-tinted, wavy hair, white face paint, and smeared red lipstick is dressed in a purple jacket and dark brown gloves. He holds a small, silver blade with a black handle to the face of a woman with brown hair who is wearing a dark green top. The overall lighting is low, with the primary focus on the two central figures.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a close-up, positioning the woman's profile on the left side of the frame and the man's profile on the right, with both subjects in the foreground. In the background, blurred figures of other people are visible. The camera then rotates in a counterclockwise arc around the man, moving from his left side to his back, which momentarily blocks the woman from view. The camera continues its rotation to his right side, settling into a medium close-up where the subjects' positions within the frame have swapped: the man is now on the left and the woman is on the right. Throughout this movement, the camera remains at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
