  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a single room in a 2D video game, framed by heads-up display elements as overlays at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners. The room has fleshy, veiny, reddish-brown walls and a beige floor stained with splatters of red blood and a patch of green liquid. In the center of the floor is a large, dark brown, cross-shaped object. A demonic head character with dark brown skin, white eyes, and curved, spiral-shaped ram horns starts in the center-left, with a small black cat-like figure with pointed ears and white eyes slightly above and to the left of it, and a pale, round-headed creature with a large smile and dark pink, vein-like hair to its left. Another purple, round-headed creature with a large smile and similar hair occupies the right side. The demonic head moves up to the upper-center of the frame and fires a long, wavy red effect rightward, making the purple face creature disappear. The pale, round-headed creature moves from the left side of the screen toward the top and is then surrounded by several small red orbs. Following this, the demonic head character moves down to the bottom center, firing another long, wavy red effect upward, making the pale face creature disappear. As this happens, the cat-like creature keeps following the demonic head as it moves around the room. A small, red, regular hexagonal weapon surrounds the demonic head, and a round, black bomb with a lit fuse briefly appears near the center at the end of the video. The camera remains completely static throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "In a room with a fleshy, veined border, several atypical creatures are present. The main figure is a dark brown, demonic head with white eyes and curved, spiral-shaped ram horns, surrounded by a small, red, regular hexagonal weapon. There are also two round-headed creatures: the larger one has a purple face, and the smaller one has a pale face. Both have large smiles, and their heads are surrounded by dark pink, vein-like hair. At one point, the smaller round-headed creature, while attacking, is surrounded by several small, red orbs. A small, black, cat-like figure with pointed ears and white eyes is also visible. A round, black bomb with a lit fuse appears briefly. The scene is marked by splatters of red and green liquid.",
    "Motion": "The creature with curved, spiral-shaped ram horns moves to the upper part of the room and fires a long, red, wavy effect toward the right, causing the purple, round-headed creature to vanish as it passes by. The pale, round-headed creature moves from the left side of the screen toward the top and is then surrounded by several small red orbs. Following this, the demonic head character moves to the lower-center right, leaving a wavy red effect upward toward the pale creature, making it vanish. A black bomb briefly appears near the center. Meanwhile, the small, black, cat-like figure follows the creature with ram horns and moves around the room.",
    "Scene": "A 2D gaming video shows a single, square room with fleshy, veiny, reddish-brown walls. In the center of the beige floor is a large, dark brown, cross-shaped object. The floor is stained with splatters of red blood and a patch of green liquid. Several small, pixelated figures, including a brown sheep-like creature with curved, spiral-shaped ram horns, two pink round-headed creatures, and a cat-like creature, move within the space. Overlay elements frame the scene. In the top-left corner, a heads-up display shows an hourglass, heart icons, and numerical values for coins, bombs, and keys. In the top-right corner, a map-like square is visible. In the bottom-right corner, the text \"1 - The Magician\" is visible, and a white snake icon is in the bottom-left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
