  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an RV park during the daytime under a partly cloudy sky. A large fifth-wheel RV, painted with tan, white, and black swooping graphics, occupies the middle ground, positioned from the left to the center of the frame. In the foreground, a curved retaining wall constructed from brown, textured blocks stretches across the bottom of the frame, with a patio on top holding a black grill next to a white propane tank on the left and a small black metal table with matching chairs and two Adirondack chairs in the center, creating an inviting outdoor living space. Small green bushes are planted along the retaining wall. A large tree with green leaves in the immediate foreground on the left partially frames the view. A paved road runs from the bottom-right into the background, where other RVs are visible on the right. The camera, positioned at eye-level, pans from left to right across the campsite, providing a broader view of the surroundings. The slightly unsteady camera then pans slightly to the left, making the framing tree on the left and the road on the right more prominent. The deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the large RV in the middle ground and other RVs in the background, sharp. The focus is on the environment itself, establishing a sense of a peaceful and comfortable outdoor setting.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a scenery shot of a modern RV park, capturing a specific campsite in detail. A large recreational vehicle with a beige, black, and white swooping design is parked on a grassy patch, shaded by a large tree. In front of it sits a raised patio area built with brown retaining wall blocks, furnished with a black grill, a small metal table and chairs, and two Adirondack chairs, creating an inviting outdoor living space. The camera pans to the right, revealing more of the campground, where other RVs are parked further down the paved road under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the environment itself, establishing a sense of a peaceful and comfortable outdoor setting.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dynamic scenery shot of a large recreational vehicle parked at a campsite. The site features a landscaped patio with a retaining wall, outdoor furniture, and a grill. The setting is a peaceful RV park with trees and the rear ends of other RVs visible in the background. The camera pans to the right and then slightly to the left, providing a broader view of the surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an RV park during the daytime under a partly cloudy sky. A large fifth-wheel RV, painted with tan, white, and black swooping graphics, is parked at a campsite. The site is elevated on a curved retaining wall constructed from brown, textured blocks. On this raised patio area, there is a black grill next to a white propane tank, a small black metal table with matching chairs, and two outdoor lounge chairs. Small green bushes are planted along the retaining wall. A paved road runs alongside the campsites, where other RVs are visible in the background. A large tree with green leaves stands in the foreground, partially framing the view of the main RV as the perspective slowly zooms out.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
