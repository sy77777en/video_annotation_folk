  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures the interior of a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic walls. In the foreground and extending all the way to the plastic film in the background, several black irrigation pipes are laid in parallel lines across a bed of dark, tilled soil. A single, small green plant with large, broad leaves is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the left of center. In the middle ground, four scattered wooden planks are visible, with two on the left and two on the right. In the middle ground on the left, several black plastic pots filled with pink and white flowers sit on wooden planks. The camera remains static, captured from a fixed but slightly unsteady, eye-level, high-angle perspective, utilizing a deep focus to ensure the entire scene remains sharp. This time-lapse video captures the dynamic interior of the greenhouse, where subtle movements of the black pipes can be observed. The plant on the left shows noticeable growth over time, and in the middle ground on the far left, plants are transplanted from small pots to larger ones. Occasionally, scenes outside the plastic film become visible. The scene is brightly and evenly lit, with the translucent walls and metal frame of the greenhouse visible behind the potted flowers.",

    "Subject": "Inside a greenhouse with a translucent plastic covering and a metal frame, a single, small green plant with large, broad leaves is planted in a bed of dark, tilled soil. Several black irrigation pipes are laid out in parallel lines across the soil, running from the foreground to the background. In the middle ground on the left, several black plastic pots filled with pink and white flowers sit on wooden planks. Additional wooden planks are laid across the soil in various places.",

    "Scene": "Inside a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic walls, the tilled soil is prepared for planting. Several black irrigation hoses run in parallel lines across the dark soil, with wooden planks laid across them at intervals. A single, small green plant with large leaves grows in one of the rows. In the middle ground on the left, several black pots hold pink and white flowering plants. The scene is brightly and evenly lit.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
