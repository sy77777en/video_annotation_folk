  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with no single main subject. The focus is on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. Initially, a grassy clearing occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is composed of rolling green hills and some trees, from which a vibrant rainbow emerges at the bottom right-center and arcs towards the top left. The camera, held at eye level, captures a wide landscape with deep focus, keeping the foreground and distant hills sharp. It performs an unsteady, shaky pan to the left while tilting slightly upward to follow the arc of the rainbow, transitioning the view from a level to a low angle. As the camera smoothly pans left, then upward and downward, it effectively traces the full arc of the rainbow against a dramatic sky filled with both blue patches and dark, heavy clouds. During this movement, a large tree enters from the left, becoming a prominent foreground element that frames the view of the rainbow and the distant hills. The camera is initially positioned at a level angle, and as it follows the rainbow, it tilts more upward and then slightly downward, looking out over the expansive scenery. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. The camera pans to the left while tilting up and down, effectively capturing the dynamic movement and enhancing the viewer's experience as it follows the curve of the rainbow rising from behind a hill and extending high into the cloudy expanse, with the tops of green trees visible throughout.",

    "Camera": "Held at eye level, the camera captures a wide landscape with a deep focus, keeping the foreground and distant hills sharp. The camera performs an unsteady, shaky pan to the left while tilting slightly upward to follow the arc of a rainbow, transitioning the view from a level to a low angle.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant rainbow arching across a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment, emphasizing the ephemeral spectacle of the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
    "Motion": "This video showcases a scenic landscape with a vibrant rainbow. The camera smoothly pans left, then upward and downward, effectively tracing the full arc of the rainbow against a dramatic sky filled with both blue patches and dark clouds. The view overlooks rolling hills covered in lush green trees and vegetation.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a lush, green landscape of rolling hills covered in dense trees under a dramatic sky. A vibrant rainbow arches across the sky, which is a mix of blue patches and dark, heavy clouds. The foreground consists of a grassy, unkempt clearing with small trees. The camera pans to the left while tilting up and down, effectively capturing the dynamic movement and enhancing the viewer's experience as it follows the curve of the rainbow rising from behind a hill and extending high into the cloudy expanse, with the tops of green trees visible throughout.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
