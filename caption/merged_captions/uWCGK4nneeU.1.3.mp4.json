  "merged_caption": "This medium shot focuses on a sandy-yellow, weathered airplane's cockpit, which initially occupies the center of the frame against a clear blue sky. The plane's fuselage features visible rivets and worn paint, with the word \"RESCUE\" stenciled in black capital letters on the fuselage in the bottom-left foreground. Inside the cockpit, a woman with dark skin and short, dark, curly hair is seated in the pilot's position, wearing a dark tank top. She is visible in the center-right of the frame, sitting sideways and looking down towards the window beside the cockpit on her left. A portion of the plane's wing can be seen in the top background. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the woman in the cockpit while simultaneously ascending, transitioning from a low angle looking up at the aircraft to a high angle looking down into the cockpit. This motion causes the perspective to shift from the left front of the plane to a position slightly to the right of the front, with the cockpit moving towards the left side of the frame by the end of the clip. Inside, the woman turns the steering wheel to her left, causing both the airplane's body and her own body to tilt leftward. The camera tracks the plane, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus sharp on the woman in the foreground as the aircraft moves over a sunlit, arid environment. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, capturing the utilitarian cockpit through the large, multi-panel glass canopy.",

    "Camera": "At an aerial level, the camera smoothly arcs clockwise while increasing in height around the girl flying the plane. This motion transitions the perspective from a low angle looking up at the aircraft to a high angle looking down into the cockpit. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the focus sharp on the girl in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A sandy-yellow, weathered airplane with visible rivets along its seams is shown in a close-up view of its cockpit. The word \"RESCUE\" is stenciled in black capital letters below the side window. Inside the cockpit, a woman with dark skin and short, dark, curly hair is seated in the pilot's position. She is wearing a dark tank top, and her upper body is visible as she sits sideways, looking down towards the window beside the cockpit on her left.",
    "Motion": "The camera arcs counterclockwise around the woman in the cockpit while simultaneously ascending, moving across the exterior of the airplane's cockpit. Inside, a woman in the pilot's seat looks down and to her left, turning the steering wheel in that direction, which causes both the airplane's body and her own body to tilt leftward.",
    "Scene": "A close-up view shows a weathered, yellow aircraft in flight against a clear blue sky. The plane's sandy-colored fuselage features visible rivets and worn paint, with a black \"RESCUE\" stencil located below the large, multi-panel glass canopy. Through the glass, the utilitarian cockpit is visible, containing a person in the pilot's seat as the aircraft moves over a sunlit, arid environment.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot focuses on a yellow airplane's cockpit, which initially occupies the center of the frame. The pilot is visible inside, positioned in the center-right. A portion of the plane's wing can be seen in the top background, while the word \"RESCUE\" is stenciled on the fuselage in the bottom-left foreground. The camera tracks the plane, rotating clockwise around it and shifting its perspective from the left front of the plane to a position slightly to the right of the front. This movement causes the cockpit to move towards the left side of the frame by the end of the clip. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
