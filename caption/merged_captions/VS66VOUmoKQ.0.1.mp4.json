  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot, with the camera positioned at a high angle above the subjects, employing a shallow depth of field. A pair of light-skinned hands occupies the foreground, positioned centrally within the frame, holding and manipulating a light blue, matte-finished watch band with a distinctive wavy, scalloped edge. The band features a series of small, dark, circular holes along its edges and more oval-shaped holes on the top and bottom. Initially, the band is shown with its wavy edges and circular side holes facing the camera. The hands then flex the band by bending it into a U-shape and straightening it slightly, revealing its top and bottom oval-shaped holes, while the band remains in the central foreground. The scene is brightly lit, focusing on the texture and flexibility of the watch band. In the extremely blurred background, a few colorful, thin, cylindrical objects are visible in the top left corner, a darker object is situated in the top right background, and what appear to be additional white bands are located in the bottom-center background.",

    "Camera": "The camera is static, positioned at a high angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the light blue, perforated watch band held in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds and flexes a light blue, matte-finished band. The band features a distinctive wavy or scalloped edge on both sides. Along the edges, there is a series of small, dark, circular holes, while the top and bottom of the band have more oval-shaped holes. The hands manipulate the band, demonstrating its flexibility.",
    "Motion": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds a light blue band, then flexes it by bending it into a U-shape and then straightening it slightly.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, shows a pair of hands holding and flexing a light blue, perforated watch band. The band has a distinctive wavy, scalloped edge and features a series of small, circular holes running along its length. In the blurred background, a few colorful, thin, cylindrical objects are visible in the upper left corner, along with a darker object in the top-right corner and what seem to be additional white bands in the bottom-center of the frame. The scene is brightly lit, focusing on the texture and flexibility of the watch band.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot, with the camera positioned above the subjects. A pair of light-skinned hands occupies the foreground, positioned centrally within the frame. These hands hold and manipulate a light blue watch band, which serves as the central point of focus. The band is initially shown with its wavy edges and circular side holes facing the camera, then it is slightly rotated and flexed, revealing its top and bottom oval-shaped holes, while remaining in the central foreground. In the extremely blurred background, a few colorful objects are visible in the top left corner. A darker object is situated in the top right background, and what appear to be additional white bands are located in the bottom-center background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
