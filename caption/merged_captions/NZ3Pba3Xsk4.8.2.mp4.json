  "merged_caption": "At the beginning of the video, shot from a first-person POV at the subjects' level, a man and a woman are in the foreground at the bottom right, while another man and woman are positioned in the center of the middle ground. The camera follows these groups as they walk along a wooden boardwalk that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. The scene is framed by lush green trees on the top, left, and right. To the left of the boardwalk, a rocky animal enclosure with a small body of water is situated in the middle ground, and a dirt path runs parallel to the boardwalk in the right middle ground. A tree is visible in the middle ground on the right side. In the background, a light blue roller coaster track is visible above the trees on the left. As the video progresses, the man and woman initially in the bottom right foreground move to the middle ground, while the man and woman originally in the center of the middle ground shift towards the left side of the frame, eventually reaching the left foreground and then exiting the frame on the left. The camera moves steadily forward, maintaining a consistent distance from the group as they walk away from the viewer. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, trucks slightly to the right and then pans left to focus on a rock, shifting attention away from the group. A deep focus is used, keeping both the rock and the surrounding zoo environment sharp. The man on the right has short dark hair and wears a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt and black pants. The woman next to him has shoulder-length brown hair and is dressed in a beige long-sleeved top and a long teal skirt, carrying a large navy and white tote bag. Three of the individuals are clearly wearing white face masks.",

    "Camera": "From a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera follows a group of people walking through a zoo.

    "Subject": "This video, shot from a first-person perspective, follows a group of four young adults in a park. The two central figures are a man and a woman walking away from the camera. The man, on the right, has short dark hair and wears a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt and black pants. The woman next to him has shoulder-length brown hair and is dressed in a beige long-sleeved top and a long teal skirt, carrying a large navy and white tote bag. To their left, another man with short, dyed-blond hair wears a white shirt, a brown vest, and dark green pants while holding a white plastic bag. On the far left, a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair stands wearing a blue denim jacket and grey pants, holding a green tote bag and looking at her phone. Three of the individuals are clearly wearing white face masks, while it is unclear if the woman with the large navy and white tote bag is also wearing one.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera captures a dynamic scene along a wooden path in a park-like setting. On the right side, a man and a woman walk away from the camera, while on the left, another man and woman approach. The woman on the left carries a green tote bag and holds her phone in both hands, poised to take photos at any moment. Meanwhile, a man with a white plastic bag pauses to take a photo towards the left side of the frame before continuing to walk towards the camera and eventually exiting the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward along a wooden boardwalk in an outdoor park-like setting during the daytime. The path is lined with lush green trees, and to the left, a railing with glass panels overlooks a rocky enclosure containing a small body of water. In the background, a light blue roller coaster track is visible above the trees. Several people wearing face masks are seen walking along the boardwalk and an adjacent dirt path.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
