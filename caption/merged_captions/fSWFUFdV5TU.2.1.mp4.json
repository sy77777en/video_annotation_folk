  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a static, slightly unsteady shot from an eye-level, level angle, focusing on a cityscape at night with a shallow depth of field. A light-colored ledge is visible in the middle ground, and a large, dark building is positioned in the background, with other city lights, including a single red one, visible further back. Light snow falls against the dark skyline. The camera then performs a rack focus to the midground, bringing into sharp focus a man with short, dark, curly hair, wearing a dark denim jacket, as he walks into the frame from the right. He is seen from behind as he moves toward the center and stops at a balcony railing in the center middle ground, looking out over the cityscape. The man stands with his back to the camera, observing the cityscape at night. The camera remains positioned at the man's level, capturing the scene as he pauses to take in the view, with the large, multi-story building's dark facade punctuated by a few warmly lit windows in the center of the frame.",

    "Subject": "A man with short, dark, curly hair is revealed as he walks into the frame from the right. He is seen from behind, wearing a dark denim jacket, and he stops to look out over a cityscape at night.",
    "Motion": "A man, seen from behind, is revealed as he walks into the frame from the right and stops at a balcony railing, looking out at the cityscape at night.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point overlooking a city at night, light snow falls against a dark skyline. A large, multi-story building stands in the center, its dark facade punctuated by a few warmly lit windows. In the middle ground, a person wearing a dark jacket walks up to a light-colored ledge and stands with their back to the camera, observing the cityscape. Distant building lights, including a single red one, are visible in the background.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at night, featuring a light-colored ledge in the middle ground. A large, dark building is positioned in the background, with other city lights visible further back. A man then enters from the right side of the frame, and the shot transitions to a medium shot of him from behind. He walks toward the center and stops in the center middle ground, looking out at the cityscape. The camera is positioned at the man's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
