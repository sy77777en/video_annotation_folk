  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a close-up shot of a pair of hands manipulating a deck of playing cards, with the left hand holding the cards on the left side of the frame and the right hand moving dynamically between the right side and the center of the frame. The right hand places a few cards face down into the stack on the right, then organizes both the stack and the cards in the left hand. Subsequently, the right hand picks two cards in turn from the stack and combines them with the cards in the left hand for display. The hands, with light skin tone, are actively engaged in holding and sorting through the cards, which include various suits such as hearts, spades, and diamonds. The cards are standard playing cards, with visible numbers and suit symbols. To the right, a stack of cards lies on a flat surface with one card face-up showing a colorful design, partially visible. The hands and cards remain the primary focus throughout, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled high, looking down at the hands. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the cards in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The background consists of a neutral, light-colored surface, providing a simple backdrop that keeps attention on the card handling. The spatial composition varies slightly, with the hands shifting positions, while the stack of cards stays in the background on the right. The setting is indoors, with even lighting suggesting a well-lit room, emphasizing the interaction with the deck. The video is in slow motion, enhancing the detailed view of the card handling process.",

    "Motion": "The video features a pair of hands interacting with a deck of playing cards. The left hand holds a stack of cards while the right hand places a few cards face down into the stack on the right. The right hand then organizes both the stack and the cards in the left hand. Subsequently, the right hand picks two cards in turn from the stack and combines them with the cards in the left hand for display. The background is a plain, light-colored surface, and there is a stack of additional cards on the right side of the frame. The hands continue to shuffle and arrange the cards throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of a person holding and examining a hand of playing cards. The setting is indoors, with a neutral, light-colored surface serving as the backdrop. The cards are standard playing cards, featuring a mix of red and black suits, with visible numbers and symbols. A deck of cards is placed on the table, partially visible, with a card face-up next to it. The lighting is even, suggesting a well-lit room, and the focus remains on the hands and cards, emphasizing the interaction with the deck.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
