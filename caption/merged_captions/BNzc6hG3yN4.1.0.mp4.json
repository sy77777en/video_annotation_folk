  "merged_caption": "Initially, in a full shot, the main subject, a Black man wearing a black puffer jacket over a colorful graphic t-shirt, a necklace, and black pants, stands on the seat of a custom ATV in the center-left foreground, with his right leg on the seat and his left leg on the wheel. He points his left hand upward. To his right, another Black man in a bright yellow puffer jacket sits on a blue ATV positioned in the middle ground. Directly behind the main subject, two other men in long overcoats and a black and yellow dirt bike with gold-colored rims are in the center middle ground, near an orange plastic traffic barrier. The scene is set outdoors on a large, gray paved area adjacent to a body of water, bordered by a low concrete wall. The camera begins at an eye-level, level angle on the man standing on the ATV, then smoothly cranes up in a wide arc around the group, transitioning to an overhead height and a bird's-eye view. As the camera shifts to a high-angle view, the main subject lowers his arm and raises both arms, bending his elbows to bring his clenched fists together in front of his chest while appearing to speak. Meanwhile, a man in a long coat behind him steps slightly forward, waving his arms. In this final framing, the main subject is positioned towards the lower-center-left with the ATV on the left side of the frame, while the other subjects and vehicles are not visible. The camera finishes at an upside-down high angle, using deep focus to keep all subjects and vehicles in sharp detail throughout the movement.",

    "Subject": "The main subject is a Black man who is standing on the seat of a custom ATV, with his right leg stepping on the seat and his left leg stepping on the wheel. He is wearing a black puffer jacket over a colorful graphic t-shirt, a necklace, and black pants. Initially, he points his left hand upwards and then raises both arms with elbows bent inward, bringing clenched fists together in front of his chest. The ATV he is on is primarily black and purple, featuring a purple seat, purple-rimmed rear wheels, and a body covered in vibrant, graffiti-style stickers. To his right, another Black man wearing a bright yellow puffer jacket sits on a blue ATV. In the middleground behind the first man, there is a man in a long, dark plaid overcoat and a dark head covering with graffiti-style stickers. Additionally, a fourth man in a long overcoat is standing behind in the middleground. A black and yellow dirt bike with gold-colored rims is parked on the right side of the scene.",
    "Motion": "A man standing with one foot on the seat of a custom ATV initially points his left hand upward. As the camera shifts to a high-angle view, he lowers his arm and then raises both arms, bending his elbows to bring his clenched fists together in front of his chest while appearing to speak. While the other individuals and vehicles in the scene remain mostly stationary, a man in a long coat behind him steps slightly forward, waving his arms.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a large, gray paved area adjacent to a body of water, bordered by a low concrete wall. Several vehicles are present, including a custom ATV in the foreground with a purple and black frame, vibrant graphic decals, and purple-rimmed wheels. In the middle ground, a blue ATV is visible, along with a black and yellow dirt bike parked near an orange plastic traffic barrier. Four men are positioned around the vehicles on the pavement. The camera perspective transitions from a level-angle view to an inverted high-angle shot, looking down but not directly on the group and their vehicles.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, in a full shot, the main subject stands on an ATV in the center-left foreground. To his right, another man sits on a blue ATV positioned in the middle ground. Directly behind the main subject, two other men and an orange barrier occupy the center middle ground, while a dirt bike is parked in the right middle ground. The scene is framed with the camera at the subjects' level. The camera then cranes upward, transitioning to an inverted high-angle perspective that looks down on the group. In this final framing, the main subject is positioned towards the lower-center-left with the ATV on the left side of the frame, while the other subjects and vehicles are not visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
