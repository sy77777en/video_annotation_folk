  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, eye-level view of a pixelated computer interface that fills the entire frame, resembling a screen recording on a computer. Initially, the central area of the screen displays the \"Home Page of Dylan Merchant,\" featuring green text on a dark background discussing an audio player called \"DM_Tunebox\" and a \"SECRET PROJECT,\" with a thick green border on the left and right sides of the text. A white arrow cursor is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the text. The view then transitions to a search results page within the same window frame, where the cursor moves from the upper-left area to the center to click on a link. The system's top bar shows the date as \"1999.11.05.\" The final view shows a new page where the words \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" are centered in the upper-middle portion of the frame. Below this text, three animated, pixelated images of young, light-skinned girls dressed as angels, each in a different pose, are arranged horizontally across the lower-middle part of the screen. The girl on the far left holds a basket of flowers in her right hand, the one in the middle holds a dove in each hand, and the girl on the far right has her hands gently lowered at her sides. The cursor moves from the upper-middle area down to the lower-right corner, stopping on the black area of the screen. Throughout the video, the main window remains fixed, with only its internal content changing. Tags such as \"hypnospace,\" \"illegalcontent,\" and \"badguy\" are visible in a sidebar on the different pages.",

    "Subject": "This video showcases a user navigating a pixelated computer interface with a purple-blue border and a black inner page, reminiscent of a late 1990s operating system. The user explores a fictional internet called \"Hypnospace Explorer,\" moving from a personal homepage to a search results page after searching for \"badguy.\" This leads to a page with the heading \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" in red, pixelated text. On this page are three animated, pixelated images of young, light-skinned girls standing in a row, each dressed as an angel. They all have golden hair, white halos, and large white wings, and are wearing long, flowing gowns. The girl on the far left holds a basket of flowers in her right hand, the one in the middle holds a dove in each hand, and the girl on the far right has her hands gently lowered at her sides. The page also displays text that sarcastically identifies the creator and provides a name and address.",
    "Motion": "The cursor scrolls down a webpage, then the view switches to a search results page. The cursor moves to this page and clicks on a slim text box in the upper middle part of the screen. A new page appears, and the cursor slightly moves down and to the right, stopping on a black area of the screen.",
    "Scene": "A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a user navigating a retro, pixelated operating system with a purple and blue border and a black interior page. The main window, titled \"HYPNOSPACE EXPLORER,\" initially displays the \"Home Page of Dylan Merchant,\" which features green text on a dark background discussing an audio player called \"DM_Tunebox\" and a \"SECRET PROJECT,\" with a thick green border on the left and right sides of the text. A white arrow cursor navigates the screen, performing a search for the term \"badguy.\" The search results lead to a new page with a red and brown header indicating \"NO VIOLATION POINTS\" and \"MODEL CITIZEN.\" Below this, the page displays the words \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" in large red letters above three pixelated images of angels on a black background. The system's top bar shows the date as \"1999.11.05.\" Tags such as \"hypnospace,\" \"illegalcontent,\" and \"badguy\" are visible in a sidebar on the different pages.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
