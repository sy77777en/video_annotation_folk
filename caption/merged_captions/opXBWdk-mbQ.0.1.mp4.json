  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames three men sitting in a row at a long, white counter in a brightly lit, modern indoor setting. The main subject, a light-skinned man in his late 20s or early 30s with short, neat brown hair, is positioned in the middle ground on the left, wearing a maroon polo shirt and eating a salad from a clear, rectangular plastic container with a fork. The camera is static at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on this man. Initially, he looks down at his food before lifting a forkful of salad to his mouth, eating it, and then looking up and straight ahead. To his left in the center background, a second light-skinned man in his 30s, wearing a dark green t-shirt, sits and reaches into a brown paper bag. This man turns his head to look at the first man. To the right of him, a third light-skinned man in his 30s, wearing a white collared shirt, is positioned in the right background and also turns his head slightly to look in the same direction. The background is softly blurred, showing the interior of a contemporary space, with a blurred wooden corner visible in the bottom right foreground.",

    "Subject": "Three men are sitting in a row at a long white counter, eating lunch. The man in the middle ground, who is the most in focus, is a light-skinned man in his late 20s or early 30s with short, neat brown hair. He is wearing a maroon polo shirt and is seen in profile, eating a salad from a clear plastic container with a fork. To his left, the right side of the framet, slightly out of focus, are two additional light-skinned men in their 30s. One is wearing a dark green t-shirt and is taking food out of a brown paper bag, while the other is wearing a white collared shirt. Both of these men turn their heads to look at the man in the middle ground.",
    "Motion": "The man in the middle ground lifts a forkful of salad from a container to his mouth, eats it, and then looks up and straight ahead.

    "Scene": "In a brightly lit, modern indoor setting, three men are seated in a row at a long, white counter, eating their lunch. The man in the middle ground wears a maroon polo shirt and eats a salad from a clear, rectangular plastic container with a fork. Next to him, another man in a black t-shirt reaches into a brown paper bag, while a third man in a white shirt sits further down the counter. The background is softly blurred, showing the interior of a contemporary space.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames three men sitting in a row at a long counter. The main subject is positioned in the middle ground on the left, eating from a container. To his left in the center background, a second man sits, and to the right of him, a third man is positioned in the right background. The man in the middle ground initially looks down at his food before lifting his head and looking straight ahead.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
