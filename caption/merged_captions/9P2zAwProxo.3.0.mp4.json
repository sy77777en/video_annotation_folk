  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium selfie POV shot, positioning a person from the thighs up on the right side of the frame, wearing a black varsity-style jacket with long white sleeves and a white vertical stripe on the right side of their waist. The snowy ground and background trees occupy the left. This is a first-person shot of a skier filming himself with a selfie stick, starting at eye level with a level angle. As the person falls backward into the snow, the camera, which they are holding, tumbles with them, tilting down and shifting to an upside-down high angle looking down at the snow, incorporating a changing Dutch angle due to the rolling motion. The movement is unsteady, culminating in a violent shake upon impact. As the person falls, a brown circular patch on the jacket becomes visible. The frame shakes and tilts, causing the perspective to shift, and the person moves out of the frame. The shot settles into a high-angle view of the ground, where a black selfie stick is positioned in the center foreground. In the top right middle ground, a portion of a board with a person's foot in a black shoe or boot on it is visible, with the rest of the scene filled by the snowy ground. The scene is set in a snow-covered outdoor area during the day, with white snow blanketing the ground, dotted with a few small twigs. The bare trunks of trees are visible in both the background and middleground, suggesting a winter forest. A black, cursive text overlay reading \"Travel Feed\" appears near the center of the view, with a black \"Travel Feed\" logo in a script font overlaid on the video.",

    "Camera": "This is a first-person shot of a skier filming himself with a selfie stick. The camera starts at eye level with a level angle. As the skier falls, the camera tilts down and shifts to an upside-down high angle looking down at the snow, incorporating a changing Dutch angle due to the rolling motion. The movement is unsteady, culminating in a violent shake upon impact. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a person seen from the thighs up, wearing a black varsity-style jacket with long white sleeves. A white vertical stripe is visible on the right side of their waist. As the person falls, a brown circular patch on the jacket becomes visible. The focus then shifts to objects on the snowy ground. In the foreground, a long, black, cylindrical selfie stick is visible, with a black \"Travel Feed\" logo in a script font overlaid on the video. Nearby, a board with a white and beige surface is seen, with a person's foot in a black shoe or boot resting on it.",
    "Motion": "A person falls backward into the snow, and the camera, which they are holding, tumbles with them. The view then settles on a shot of a selfie stick and a snowboard lying on the snowy ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene begins with a selfie POV shot at eye level, descending to the ground as the person lowers themselves. Set in a snow-covered outdoor area during the day, the white snow blankets the ground, dotted with a few small twigs. The bare trunks of trees are visible in both the background and middleground, suggesting a winter forest. The person, wearing a black jacket with a white sleeve, falls backward into the snow, causing the camera to shake as it moves forward. A black, cursive text overlay reading \"Travel Feed\" appears near the center of the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
