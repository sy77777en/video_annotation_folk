  "merged_caption": "This medium shot centers on a cartoon cat named Tom, dressed in a red devil costume, positioned in the foreground. The cat's body is entirely red, with a lighter pinkish-white patch on its chest and belly, small red horns on its head, a red cape with a high collar, a pointed red tail, and a small gold ring-shaped ornament on a red collar around its neck. It holds a red trident in its left white hand. The camera is at the subject's level, maintaining a level-angle shot that keeps Tom in sharp focus against a significantly blurred real-world background, creating a striking contrast. In the background, blurred city structures and out-of-focus bokeh lights fill the frame, set outdoors at night in a city. The cat, holding a red trident in its left hand, initially pulls its right hand close to its chest. It briefly tilts its head down before raising its upper body and head toward the left side of the frame, simultaneously extending its right arm and opening its hand in a welcoming gesture toward the left. The cartoon cat gestures with its right arm continuously before placing its right hand near its chest while its head moves backward. It then extends its right arm outward twice while smiling and talking, with its facial expression shifting and its mouth moving as if speaking throughout the sequence. The camera remains mostly static, with only very minor, smooth movement. The background features indistinct, dark structures seemingly part of two tall buildings and numerous circular, white bokeh lights. The cat's eyes are yellow, and it has a white muzzle.",

It then extends its right arm outward twice while smiling and talking, with its facial expression shifting and its mouth moving as if speaking throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors at night in a city. The background is intentionally blurred, featuring indistinct, dark structures seemingly part of two tall buildings and numerous circular, white bokeh lights. A cartoon cat in a red devil costume, holding a matching red trident, is positioned in the foreground against this urban backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
