  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot of a woman with dark brown hair styled in braids and wearing red lipstick, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. She is dressed in a multi-colored cropped long-sleeved top featuring yellow, red, black, and white sections with graphic designs, worn over a black high-neck underlayer, and a long black skirt with a black belt that has a silver buckle. Her hands are in the pockets of her skirt. The scene is set in a spacious stone courtyard during the golden hour, with a large, classical-style building with a light-colored stone facade, multiple stories, and a series of arched windows in the background. A low stone balustrade runs along the front of the building, separating it from the gravel-covered ground of the courtyard. The camera captures this slow-motion video from a smooth, hip-level perspective, starting at a level angle. As the woman begins to walk towards the camera with her hands in her pockets, the camera slowly tilts upward, transitioning to a low angle and maintaining a steady focus on the central figure against the architectural backdrop. This movement transitions the shot to a medium shot, with the woman remaining centrally framed and the camera positioned at her level. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus sharp on the woman in the foreground while blurring the building behind her.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
