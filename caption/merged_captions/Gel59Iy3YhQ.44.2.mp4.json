  "merged_caption": "This wide, side-view shot captures the action in a 2D format. Initially, a humanoid figure with a golden head and a floating, fiery orb above it, wearing a brown tunic and dark-blue pants, is positioned near the center of the frame, standing on a platform. The character is shown with two red glowing armguards on their forearms. Several light-blue, spiked balls swing from chains above. Additional platforms are visible on the lower left and lower right, with the right platform featuring a row of sharp, upward-pointing spikes. The scene is set within a dark, cavernous environment with a hazy, reddish-brown background, composed of dark green and brown stone-like structures. UI elements are positioned in the bottom-left, bottom-right, and right-side corners against the hazy background: the bottom-left corner displays a green health bar, ability icons, and numbers; the bottom-right corner features a minimap, a blue orb count of 12, and a gold coin count of 2795; and the right side shows a pause timer reading \"1m 06s.\" The humanoid figure stands on a platform and swings its fists to shatter obstacles, causing debris to fly and creating a burst of red and white particle effects in the center of the scene. The character, surrounded by these particle effects, jumps up and to the right, arcing through the air above the spiked platform. The camera follows the character, initially tracking to the right and then moving downward, briefly pausing before continuing to follow the character's actions. Due to the camera tracking the subject, the character remains near the center of the frame. The video stops with the character still in midair, appearing to land to the left of a lower platform covered in spikes.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, is set within a dark, cavernous environment with a hazy, reddish-brown background. The scene is composed of dark green and brown stone-like structures, including several platforms. Swinging from the ceiling on chains are multiple light-blue, spiked balls. On a lower platform, a row of sharp, upward-pointing spikes is visible. A character creates a burst of red and white particle effects in the center of the scene. Overlay elements are present on the screen: the bottom-left corner displays a green health bar, ability icons, and numbers; the bottom-right corner features a minimap, a blue orb count of 12, and a gold coin count of 2795; and the right side shows a pause timer reading \"1m 06s.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
