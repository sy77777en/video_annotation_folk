  "merged_caption": "The video captures an urban scene with a full shot. Initially, the main subject, a young man wearing a white t-shirt over a black long-sleeved shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie, is positioned on the left side of the frame, closer to the middle ground, moving towards the center. He places his skateboard on the ground and steps onto it, beginning to skate up a ramp while maintaining his balance with his arms outstretched. In the background, a woman in a long beige coat and a man in a dark jacket, with the man wearing a mask, walk towards the camera, positioned behind the skateboarder. Several other people stand near a bus stop structure in the center and right background. A set of stairs with a metal railing occupies the right foreground and middle ground. The skateboarder moves diagonally across the frame from the left towards the right middle ground, ascending a slope alongside the stairs. He comes to a stop near the center middle ground, crouching beside the railing. The camera, at eye level with a level angle, dynamically zooms out, pans right, and slightly tilts upward to track the skateboarder's movement, exhibiting slight unsteadiness with some shaking. The environment includes a modern cityscape with concrete structures, glass windows and doors, and a small tree in the background. The buildings are characterized by clean lines and neutral colors, with metal railings and stone surfaces. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed views of the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the skateboarder's movement contrasting the stillness of the other pedestrians.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus. It tracks a skateboarder by zooming out, panning right, and slightly tilting up as the skateboarder ascends a slide. The camera exhibits slight unsteadiness with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a young man wearing a white t-shirt over a black long-sleeved shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie, holding a skateboard. He is initially seen walking on a sidewalk, surrounded by several people in the background, including a woman in a long beige coat and a man in a dark jacket, with the man being the only one wearing a mask. Both individuals in the background have their faces blurred. The young man then moves towards a set of stairs, where he is seen crouching after skateboarding up a slope. The focus remains on his actions and attire, with other individuals present but less prominently featured.",
    "Motion": "A young man, dressed in a white t-shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie, places his skateboard on the ground and steps onto it. He begins to skate up a ramp, maintaining his balance with his arms outstretched. The background shows several people, including a woman in a beige coat and a man in a dark jacket, with the man wearing a mask. The young man continues to skate up the ramp, crouching slightly as he approaches the top. The environment includes a modern building with a glass facade and a small tree in the background.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a modern cityscape with a mix of concrete structures and glass windows and doors. The scene includes a sidewalk with a small grassy area and a bus stop, where several people are present, some wearing masks. A skateboarder is seen navigating the environment, moving along the sidewalk and up a slope. The buildings are characterized by clean lines and neutral colors, with metal railings and stone surfaces. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed views of the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the skateboarder's movement contrasting the stillness of the other pedestrians.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
