  "merged_caption": "This wide shot features a large, multi-leveled purple structure occupying the right side of the scene in a 2D video. A small, white, pixelated character with a round body and a rectangular head, having three black dots on its face and a red dot on top, is positioned near the center of the frame, climbing a patch of green, pixelated vines on the structure's face. Other small, white, pixelated creatures with a blocky, bird-like shape are located on ledges above the main character, exhibiting subtle hopping movements. In the background, a dark, starry sky sets the scene, with floating, purple, block-like structures and thin, vertical waterfalls cascading down the main structure's side. As the main character climbs vertically up the vines, the camera moves upward with minor trucking to the right, following the character's movement. Upon reaching the top of the vines, the character jumps to a ledge on the right. The camera continues to track the character, revealing the upper sections of the main structure, a new floating platform with a chest in the top-left, and another platform in the top-right, while the lower levels move out of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, maintaining a smooth side-tracking motion.",

    "Camera": "In a very smooth shot, the camera side-tracks the avatar, moving upward with minor trucking to the right to follow it as it climbs.",
    "Subject": "A small, white, pixelated character with a round body and a rectangular head is depicted climbing a patch of green, pixelated vines. The character has three black dots on its face representing the eyes and mouth, and a red dot on top of its head. On ledges above this character, there are other small, white, pixelated creatures with a blocky, bird-like shape. These creatures are not entirely motionless; they exhibit subtle hopping movements. All the figures are rendered in a simple, two-dimensional, blocky art style.",
    "Motion": "A small, white, squarish character climbs up a patch of green vines on the side of a purple structure. Upon reaching the top of the vines, it jumps to a ledge on the right. On the ledges, other small, white, bird-like creatures perform subtle, stationary hopping movements.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a collection of floating, purple, block-like structures against a dark, starry night sky. These multi-leveled structures are made of purple blocks with some mossy green patches and are adorned with small tufts of grass along their flat tops. A large patch of green, pixelated vines runs vertically up the face of the main structure, and thin, vertical waterfalls cascade down its side. In the background, other smaller, disconnected platforms float in the dark expanse. A small, white, bipedal character climbs the vines, and the camera moves upward while tracking to the right to follow its movement, revealing more of the towering structure and a small, floating platform with a chest on it.",

Other small, white creatures are located on ledges above the main character. In the background, a dark, starry sky sets the scene. As the main character climbs vertically up the vines, the camera moves upward while simultaneously trucking to the right, revealing the upper sections of the main structure, a new floating platform with a chest in the top-left, and another platform in the top-right, while the lower levels move out of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
