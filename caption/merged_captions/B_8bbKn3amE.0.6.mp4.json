  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot begins with a person wearing a dark blue top with a red hood and dark shorts positioned at the bottom center-left of the frame, walking steadily along the narrow, sharp crest of a steep, reddish-brown mountain ridge that extends from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, occupying the foreground and middle ground. A vast mountain range with red and dark brown hues fills the background under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera, from a smooth, aerial perspective, tracks the climber on the mountain ridge with a counter-clockwise arc. Initially, the camera is at a level angle and then tilts down into a high-angle view, while also rolling to create a dynamic Dutch angle. The shot uses deep focus to keep the expansive mountainous landscape sharp. As the camera continues its arc, it concludes with a slight forward movement toward the climber, reframing the ridge to stretch diagonally and revealing the expansive landscape. This movement causes the person to appear larger within the vast scene, and the bright sunlight casts long shadows across the rugged terrain.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a dark blue top with a red hood and dark shorts walks along the narrow crest of a steep, reddish-brown mountain ridge. The individual is seen from a distance, moving steadily along the sharp, rocky edge.",
    "Motion": "A person walks steadily along the narrow, sharp crest of a steep, reddish-brown mountain ridge. The camera tracks the climber on the ridge with a counter-clockwise arc, concluding with a slight forward movement toward the individual, revealing the expansive mountainous terrain from various aerial perspectives.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a sweeping view of a vast, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera tracks a climber on a narrow, sharp ridge composed of reddish-brown, stratified rock, moving in a counter-clockwise arc and concluding with a slight forward movement toward the climber. In the background, a range of mountains with red and dark brown hues extends across the horizon. A single person is visible walking along the crest of the ridge, and the scene is illuminated by bright sunlight that casts long shadows across the rugged terrain.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme wide shot begins with a person positioned at the bottom center-left of the frame, walking along a sharp mountain ridge that extends from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, occupying the foreground and middle ground. A vast mountain range fills the background. The camera, positioned above the subject, tracks the climber on the mountain ridge with a counter-clockwise arc, concluding with a slight forward movement toward the climber. This movement reframes the ridge to stretch diagonally, revealing the expansive landscape and causing the person to appear larger within the vast scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
