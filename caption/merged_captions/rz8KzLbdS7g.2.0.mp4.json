  "merged_caption": "The video captures a quiet residential street in a suburban neighborhood, with the street running from the bottom left foreground to the left background. Traditional Japanese houses line both sides of the street, featuring sloped, tiled roofs and wooden exteriors. In the foreground on the right, a black car is parked beside a driveway, with a small, neatly trimmed tree nearby. The garage, initially visible in the middle ground, is open, revealing two vehicles, some boxes, and children's bicycles inside. As the camera moves along the street, elements like the garage shift into the foreground and eventually exit the frame. Utility poles and wires run along the right side of the street, extending into the background, enhancing the suburban atmosphere. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, oriented at a 45-degree angle to the right side. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The handheld camera moves forward with slight panning motions, resulting in a slightly unsteady image with some shaking. The setting is outdoors on a sunny day, with clear blue skies and bright sunlight casting distinct shadows. Four large rectangular blue boxes are placed against the low wall of another house, with one box half open. An orange street corner mirror is positioned next to these boxes. The scene remains tranquil, with no visible movement, highlighting the serenity of the neighborhood. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the atmosphere and scale of the neighborhood, showcasing a blend of architectural styles with wooden and tiled structures, neatly trimmed greenery, and a clear blue sky, highlighting the peaceful and orderly setting rather than any specific object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
