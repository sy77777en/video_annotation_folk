  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames a bed in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame from left to right. A wall-mounted lamp is positioned in the middle ground on the center-left, casting a warm, orange glow onto the unmade bed with white sheets and pillows, highlighting the rumpled texture. A red pillow is partially visible behind the white ones. Above the bed, a long, rectangular framed picture hangs on the beige wall in the top left. In the center, an open doorway in the middle ground reveals a more brightly lit hallway in the background, where a toilet and a chair can be seen. Another framed picture is visible on the wall in the top right. The camera begins at an eye-level, level angle and arcs counterclockwise while tilting downward, resulting in a high-angle view. This movement causes a painting on the right wall and the open doorway to gradually move out of the frame, centering the focus more on the bed and the wall above it. Consequently, the bed, lamp, and the picture above the bed shift towards the right side of the frame, while the doorway also moves further right, slightly altering the perspective of the background hallway. The camera movement remains noticeably shaky throughout, and a shallow depth of field ensures that the bed in the foreground stays in focus. At the beginning of the video, a painting is visible on the right wall before it moves out of the frame. The rest of the room is enveloped in shadow, enhancing the dimly lit atmosphere of the bedroom.",

    "Subject": "A dimly lit bedroom is shown, with the main focus on a bed made with white sheets and pillows. A small, circular, wall-mounted lamp next to the bed casts a warm, orange glow across the bedding, highlighting the rumpled texture of the sheets. A red pillow is partially visible behind the white ones. At the beginning of the video, a painting is visible on the right wall before it moves out of the frame. On the beige wall above the bed, there is a long, rectangular framed picture. An open doorway to the right of the bed reveals a view into a more brightly lit hallway.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly arcs counterclockwise around the bed and tilts downward, causing a painting on the right wall and an open doorway to gradually move out of the frame, centering the focus more on the bed and the wall above it.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a dimly lit bedroom. The primary light source is a small, circular lamp on the wall, which casts a warm, orange glow onto an unmade bed with white sheets and pillows. A red pillow is visible next to the white ones. Above the bed, a long, rectangular framed picture hangs on the beige wall. An open doorway offers a view into a lit hallway, where a toilet and a chair can be seen in the background. Another framed picture is on the wall to the right of the doorway. The rest of the room is enveloped in shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
