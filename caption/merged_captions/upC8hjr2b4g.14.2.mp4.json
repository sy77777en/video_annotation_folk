  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot looking down a narrow, dimly lit hallway with light-colored tiled floors and walls. A door labeled \"13\" is positioned in the center of the frame in the background, at the far end of the corridor. A rectangular light fixture is located in the top center, directly above the door, initially casting an intense, ominous red glow that illuminates the entire scene and reflects off the tiles. On the left wall, a multi-paned window emits a contrasting cool, white light. The camera is positioned at eye level and smoothly moves backward, pulling away from the red-lit hallway, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene, from the foreground walls to the door at the end of the hall, in sharp detail. The red light above the door flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the hallway into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is the faint, cool light filtering through the window on the left, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. An overlay displays \"[23]\" in the bottom left corner. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease. The overall mood is suspenseful and unsettling.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot of a desolate hallway. At the far end, a closed door stands beneath a light fixture that initially bathes the entire corridor in an intense, ominous red glow. This alarming light flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is a faint, cool light filtering through a paned window on the left wall, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease.",
    "Motion": "This is a smooth, backward-moving shot of a dark, ominous hallway. A red light above a door labeled \"13\" illuminates the corridor before it flickers and turns off, leaving the scene in near-total darkness. The overall mood is suspenseful and unsettling.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a narrow, dimly lit hallway with light-colored tiled floors and walls. At the far end of the corridor, a single door with a vertical window is positioned centrally. Above this door, a rectangular light fixture casts an intense red glow, illuminating the space and reflecting off the tiles. On the left wall, a multi-paned window emits a contrasting cool, white light. The scene transitions as the red light abruptly turns off, plunging the hallway into darkness, with only the faint, cool light from the window remaining. An overlay displays \"[23]\" in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot looking down a hallway. A door is positioned in the center of the frame in the background, at the far end of the corridor. A light fixture is located in the top center, directly above the door, and a window is on the left wall in the middle ground. Initially, the light fixture casts a red glow that illuminates the entire scene. The red light then turns off, leaving the hallway in near-complete darkness, with only a faint light emanating from the window on the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
