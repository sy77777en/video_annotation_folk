  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a pair of hands holding a teal cylindrical spray can in the midground, slightly to the right of the center; the can is initially somewhat blurred. A portion of a person's dark grey short-sleeved shirt is visible on the right edge of the frame in the foreground. In the background, an open white cabinet with blurred items on its shelves occupies the left side and extends towards the center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and uses a shallow depth of field, initially out of focus. As the shot progresses, the hands bring the can slightly forward and rotate it, where it comes into sharper focus, still in the midground, through a rack focus. The can features pink and white markings, including a depiction of Hello Kitty with a pink bow on its side. The cabinet and the person's shoulder maintain their respective positions. The camera angle is initially level, then changes to a high angle due to camera motion. The camera shows some minor, unsteady movement with noticeable shaking, but no clear or intentional movement. The scene takes place indoors, in front of a white, open cabinet whose shelves are stocked with various blurred items. The overall lighting is dim.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level. The camera angle is initially level, then changes to a high angle due to camera motion. The camera uses a shallow depth of field and is initially out of focus, but achieves focus on the teal stick object in the middle ground through a rack focus. The camera shows some minor, unsteady movement with noticeable shaking, but no clear or intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "A person with light skin, wearing a dark grey short-sleeved shirt, is holding a teal cylindrical spray can. The can features pink and white markings, including a depiction of Hello Kitty with a pink bow on its side.",
    "Motion": "A person's hands hold a teal cylindrical spray can, examining it closely while rotating it to view all sides as it comes into sharper focus.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors, in front of a white, open cabinet whose shelves are stocked with various blurred items. A pair of hands, belonging to a person in a dark grey shirt, holds a teal-colored cylindrical can. This can is adorned with pink and white markings, including a white cartoon character. The overall lighting is dim.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
