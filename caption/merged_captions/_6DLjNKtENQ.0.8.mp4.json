  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a middle-aged Black man with a mustache is positioned in the center middle ground, wearing a military camouflage uniform with a \"RANGER\" tab visible on his left sleeve and a US flag patch on his right. His face is illuminated from the front in a dimly lit environment, with a serious, focused expression as he looks forward and slightly down. The scene is set within a dimly lit room, with a cool-toned light source from above casting the surroundings into deep shadow, while an additional light source in front of the man highlights his features. In the background, two flags are visible on stands: one is an American flag, and the other is white, both positioned on the right side of his head, towards the left side of the frame. A beam of reflected light is visible at the top of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in focus, with some unintentional shaking in the movement. The framing remains static throughout the shot. In the foreground, from the bottom center to the left, there is an out-of-focus square object, which appears to be a display screen. The man in the military uniform remains still, his gaze fixed forward and slightly downward, while he speaks.",

An additional light source in front of the man illuminates him, highlighting his features.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
