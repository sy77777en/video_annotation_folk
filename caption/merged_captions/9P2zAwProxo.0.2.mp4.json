  "merged_caption": "A man is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame, wearing winter sports gear including a black helmet, large blue-tinted ski goggles reflecting the sky, a black neck gaiter, a black jacket with white buttons and white sleeves, and black gloves. The camera is held at his level, creating a self-shot perspective as he skis forward down a wide, snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. The slope is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees under an overcast sky, with more trees visible in the background on the rolling terrain. The packed snow shows tracks. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The unsteady camera, held by the skier using a selfie stick, leads him from the front. It begins at an eye-level, level angle before moving down to a hip-level, low-angle perspective. A Dutch angle is present and varies as the camera rolls. As the man and camera move forward, the background scenery scrolls past, with the trees on the sides moving backward, while the man remains consistently centered. As the skier moves downhill, the camera moves backward, and at the end, it moves downward while tilting up with a slight counterclockwise roll. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "A man is featured on a snowy slope, looking directly at the camera from a level angle, suggesting a self-shot perspective. He is dressed for winter sports, wearing a black helmet and large, blue-tinted ski goggles that reflect the sky. A black neck gaiter covers his neck. He is wearing a black jacket with white buttons and white sleeves. He is also wearing black gloves.",
    "Motion": "Filmed from a selfie POV perspective, a man skis forward down a snowy slope, holding a selfie stick and looking directly ahead as he moves.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed using a selfie stick, captures them moving down a wide, snow-covered ski slope during the day. The slope is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees under an overcast sky. The person is dressed in winter gear, including a black helmet, blue-tinted goggles, a black jacket with white buttons and white sleeves, and black gloves. The packed snow shows tracks, and more trees are visible in the background on the rolling terrain.",
    "Spatial": "A man is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. The camera is held at his level, creating a self-shot perspective as he moves forward down a wide, snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. A forest of bare trees lines the slope in the middle ground and background on both the left and right sides of the frame. As the man and camera move forward, the background scenery scrolls past, with the trees on the sides moving backward, while the man remains consistently centered."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
