  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a lioness with tawny-brown fur, positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, amidst tall, green and dry grass. Her lighter, whitish fur around her muzzle and below her amber-colored eyes is visible, along with her rounded, alert ears. The environment features a mix of green and dry, yellowish grass, with thin, bare branches visible in the soft-focus background, all bathed in warm, natural light. Tall grass occupies the foreground and middle ground, surrounding the lower portion of her body. In the background to the left, out-of-focus branches are visible. Initially, the lioness is seen with her head slightly lowered and eyes closed. The camera, positioned at the lioness's level, employs a shallow depth of field and performs a smooth, subtle pan from left to right. As the camera pans, the lioness opens her eyes and lifts her head to look directly at the camera, remaining still.",

    "Camera": "From a level, ground-level position, the camera focuses on the lioness in the midground, employing a shallow depth of field. The camera performs a smooth, minor pan from left to right.",
    "Subject": "A lioness with tawny-brown fur is lying down in tall, green and dry grass. She has lighter, whitish fur around her muzzle and below her amber-colored eyes. Her rounded ears are visible and alert. Initially, her eyes are closed, but she then opens them and looks directly at the camera.",
    "Motion": "A lioness lies in the grass with her eyes closed. She then opens her eyes and stares directly at the camera, remaining still.",
    "Scene": "A lioness with tawny fur rests in an outdoor setting amidst tall, grassy vegetation. The environment is characterized by a mix of green and dry, yellowish grass, with thin, bare branches visible in the soft-focus background. The scene is bathed in warm, natural light. The lioness is initially seen with her eyes closed before opening them to look forward.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a lioness positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. Tall grass occupies the foreground and middle ground, surrounding the lower portion of her body. In the background to the left, out-of-focus branches are visible. The lioness, initially with her head slightly lowered and eyes closed, lifts her head and opens her eyes to look directly at the camera.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
