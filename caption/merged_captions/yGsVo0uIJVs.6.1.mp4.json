  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a long, sunken object resembling either a crocodile-like creature or a metallic structure is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The sandy ocean floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. From the top of the frame, beams of light filter down through the water, partially illuminating the textured exterior, reminiscent of rocky terrain, and highlighting its rough, scaly surface. A prominent, jagged dorsal ridge runs along the top, while the left side extends outward, tapering to a point. The right side is broad and flat, with visible ridges on the top, giving it a prehistoric appearance. Extended structures protrude slightly near the middle, conveying a sense of stillness and ancient presence. The camera is underwater, positioned at a high angle, looking down at the submerged object. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly dollies backward while arcing counterclockwise around the object, moving slowly without any shaking. The dimly lit environment is enhanced by beams of light filtering through the water, creating a serene and mysterious atmosphere. The structure, likely a shipwreck, is adorned with marine growth, showcasing a rugged texture with a blend of rusted metal and encrusted surfaces. The clear water offers a view of the sandy seabed, illuminated by dappled light. The setting is tranquil, with no visible movement, highlighting the stillness of the underwater world. An overlay element, positioned in the bottom left corner, displays \"[2]\" without obstructing the view, ensuring it remains unobtrusive within the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a large, submerged crocodile-like creature or possibly a sunken metallic structure resting on the ocean floor. Its surface is textured and mottled with shades of gray and brown, resembling rocky terrain. The elongated form is partially illuminated by beams of light filtering through the water, highlighting its rough, scaly appearance. A prominent, jagged dorsal ridge runs along the top, and its left side extends outward, tapering to a point. The right side is broad and flat, with visible ridges on the top, giving it a prehistoric appearance. There are extended structure that stick out slightly near the middle of the object, and the overall scene conveys a sense of stillness and ancient presence.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an underwater scene featuring a sunken metallic structure resting on the ocean floor.

    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a long, sunken object is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The sandy ocean floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. From the top of the frame, beams of light filter down through the water. The camera is positioned above the object, providing a high-angle perspective of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
