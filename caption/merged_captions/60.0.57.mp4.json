  "merged_caption": "In a low-angle full shot, a large black bag occupies the bottom foreground, with a pair of bright, fluorescent yellow sneakers visible inside at the bottom center. A woman with long, dark, curly hair and a light-to-medium skin tone, wearing a shiny red zip-up jacket, is positioned in the center middle ground, leaning forward over the bag. She is actively holding the black bag with her left hand and removing the pair of bright yellow sneakers with her right hand. On the right of the frame, another woman with light skin and dark hair in a high ponytail sits on a bench in the middle ground, wearing a light blue sports bra, black shorts, white socks, and black sneakers. She is tilting her head and appears to be putting on earrings, as both her hands are placed on her right ear. A white Nike swoosh logo is superimposed over the center of the frame. In the background, two other women with dark hair are seated on the left, both wearing pink shirts, visibly wiping sweat, indicating movement throughout the scene. The locker room features light blue, glossy tiled walls and a wooden bench where several young women are seated. Clothing and a red backpack are hung on hooks in the background, with the locker room wall extending across the entire background and a red backpack in the top left corner. The scene is illuminated by cool, blue-toned lighting. The camera, positioned at the same height as the subjects, captures the scene from a low, ground-level angle with a static but slightly unsteady frame, maintaining deep focus to keep everything sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
