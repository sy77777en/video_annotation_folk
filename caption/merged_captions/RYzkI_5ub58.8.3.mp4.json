  "merged_caption": "This close-up, static shot centers on a weevil resting on a vibrant green leaf. The weevil's head and prominent snout occupy the foreground in the center of the frame, while its body extends toward the top of the frame into the middle ground. The vibrant green leaf it sits on fills the entire frame, serving as the surface in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is focused on the midground, capturing the weevil's head and snout in sharp detail with an extremely shallow depth of field. The weevil remains completely still on the leaf, except for a slight movement in the elbowed antennae on the left side. The insect has a dark, textured body with a mottled pattern of yellowish-gold scales, particularly on its head and thorax. A long, dark snout, or rostrum, extends downward from its head. On either side of the head are large, dark, compound eyes. A pair of elbowed antennae with clubbed ends protrudes from the snout. The weevil's dark, segmented legs are visible, positioned on the surface of the leaf. The leaf beneath it is smooth, with a few small white specks visible on its surface. The scene is illuminated by bright, direct light, which creates distinct highlights on the weevil's body and legs.",

    "Subject": "A close-up, macro view shows a weevil resting on a bright green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured body with a mottled pattern of yellowish-gold scales, particularly on its head and thorax. A long, dark snout, or rostrum, extends downward from its head.

    "Scene": "A macro view captures a weevil positioned on a vibrant green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured exoskeleton with a golden-brown coloration and a pitted surface. Its head features large, dark compound eyes and a long, prominent snout extending downwards. The leaf beneath it is smooth, with a few small white specks visible on its surface. The scene is illuminated by bright, direct light, which creates distinct highlights on the weevil's body and legs.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
