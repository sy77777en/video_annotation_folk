  "merged_caption": "A group of male soldiers in desert camouflage uniforms predominantly fills the frame, positioned on a tan-colored armored vehicle in an outdoor daytime setting. The central soldier, a man with a darker complexion, is in the center foreground, wearing a dark green helmet with large headphones and holding a rifle. Behind him, two rows of soldiers are present, all wearing tactical vests and green camouflage helmets. In the right mid-ground, three soldiers face rightward and towards the camera, with one speaking into a radio handset. Another soldier wears sunglasses, and one, facing away from the camera, has a cigarette in his mouth. Behind them, another row of soldiers is facing away from the camera, located in the left mid-ground. The tan vehicle extends into the middle ground, with a large, circular, tan-colored hatch open behind the central soldier. In the background, a slatted structure and some green foliage are visible. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, maintains a deep focus, keeping the soldiers and their vehicle clear. It performs a slightly unsteady move or tilt downward. The group of soldiers remains mostly stationary throughout the video, except for the central soldier, who initially raises his left hand to adjust his communications gear before lowering it to rest on his weapon. The other soldiers exhibit no distinct movements, simply swaying naturally with the vehicle's motion while remaining securely seated. The entire scene is overlaid with a horizontal scanline effect, and text in the bottom-left corner reads, \"[15, 22]; PBS Frontline - Once Upon a Time in Iraq (2020)\" in white text.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
