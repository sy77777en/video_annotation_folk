  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman with short, dark hair and a fair skin tone, wearing a white, form-fitting outfit with orange stripes and a hood that covers most of her head, leaving her face visible. She is positioned in the left center foreground of the frame, with her body oriented towards a large, white, rectangular object with a black panel and metallic controls located on the right side of the frame. The setting is indoors, featuring a minimalist environment with plain, white walls and bright, even lighting from an artificial indoor light source. Initially, her gaze is directed towards the object, placing her attention on the right object. The woman approaches the white object, raises her gloved hands to her mouth, and appears to speak into it. As she continues speaking, she lowers her hands and turns her head to face the camera, shifting her gaze from the right side of the frame to the front right of the frame. The camera remains at her eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movements without any clear or intentional motion. The background consists of plain, white walls, which remain static and unchanging. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera movement, keeping the focus on the woman and her interaction with the object.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
