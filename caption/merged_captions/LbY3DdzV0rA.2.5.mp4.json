  "merged_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide scenery shot captured from an aerial-level camera, using a level angle and deep focus to keep the entire scene in sharp detail. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a vast sky of dark, turbulent blue and purple storm clouds, contrasting with a fiery orange and red sunset positioned in the center of the frame along the horizon. Sheets of rain are visible in the distance, illuminated by the setting sun. Two parallel highways originate in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom right corners, extending through the middle ground and converging toward the central vanishing point at the sunset. The dark landscape fills the lower portion of the frame, flanking the highways on the left and right from the foreground into the background, with distant mountains silhouetted against the bright sky. A time-lapse captures the flow of traffic, with the headlights and taillights of cars and trucks creating streaks of light as they travel in both directions along the highway. The streaks of light move away from the camera on the right highway and towards the camera on the left highway, emphasizing the sense of journey through the epic scene. The composition is dominated by the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, with the highway serving to guide the eye through the dramatic landscape.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video captured from an aerial-level camera. The shot uses a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the highways below to the distant storm clouds, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with deep blue and purple storm clouds, which contrast sharply with a fiery orange and red sunset glowing on the horizon. Sheets of rain are visible in the distance, illuminated by the setting sun. Below, two parallel highways stretch through the darkened, expansive terrain, converging toward the distant light. Headlights and taillights of cars and trucks blur into streaks of light as they travel along the roads. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, with the highway serving to guide the eye and provide a sense of journey through the epic scene.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, level-angle shot of a highway stretching towards a dramatic sunset. Dark, stormy blue clouds fill the upper sky, contrasting with the fiery orange and red glow on the horizon where rain can be seen falling. Cars and trucks are visible driving along the two separate roadways.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle perspective, a divided highway cuts through a vast, dark landscape, its parallel asphalt roads converging toward the horizon. The sky above is filled with turbulent, deep blue clouds. Below this dark cloud cover, a vibrant sunset casts a fiery orange and yellow glow across the horizon, illuminating distinct shafts of rain falling in the distance. The surrounding terrain and distant mountains are visible as dark silhouettes against the bright sky. A time-lapse captures the flow of traffic, with the headlights and taillights of cars and trucks creating streaks of light as they travel in both directions along the highway.",
    "Spatial": "This is a static, extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level angle perspective, looking down on the landscape. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a vast sky of dark clouds in the background. A vibrant sunset with visible rain is positioned in the center of the frame along the horizon, also in the background. Two parallel highways originate in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom right corners, extending through the middle ground and converging toward the central vanishing point at the sunset in the background. The dark landscape fills the lower portion of the frame, flanking the highways on the left and right from the foreground into the background, with distant mountains silhouetted in the background. The time-lapse captures traffic as streaks of light moving away from the camera on the right highway and towards the camera on the left highway."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
