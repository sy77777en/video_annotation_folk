  "merged_caption": "This is a static, over-the-shoulder shot where a person, visible from the chest up, occupies the blurred foreground on the left side of the frame. A portion of a vehicle with a pinkish-red fin is also in the foreground, extending from the bottom right toward the bottom center. Initially, there is an open trunk lid in the foreground center, which then slowly closes as the person in the foreground stands up, looking out at the cityscape. The only movement in the scene is the continuous, gentle fall of rain. The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field to keep the futuristic cityscape in the background sharp, while the foreground appears slightly blurred. In the middle ground, a digital billboard is positioned slightly left of center, with a large, spotlighted structure to its right. The billboard prominently displays the white text \"OFF WORLD\" and \"30 MIN. LEFT\" next to a graphic of a palm tree. The background is filled by a vast, in-focus cityscape that stretches across the entire frame, illuminated by countless pinpricks of white and blue light from buildings and vehicles, with large spotlights beaming into the dark, rainy sky. The sprawling metropolis is densely packed with towering structures that fade into the hazy distance. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a fixed perspective on the scene.",

    "Subject": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person with short, dark hair is seen from the back in the blurred foreground, looking out at a vast, futuristic cityscape at night. The sprawling city in the background is in sharp focus, illuminated by countless pinpricks of white and blue light from buildings and vehicles, with large spotlights beaming into the dark, rainy sky. Prominently displayed in the midground is a large, brightly lit digital billboard that reads \"OFF WORLD\" and \"30 MIN. LEFT\" in white text, alongside an image of futuristic architecture on the left and a palm tree on the right.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene overlooks a vast, futuristic cityscape at night during a downpour. The dark, sprawling metropolis is densely packed with towering structures that fade into the hazy distance, all illuminated by thousands of twinkling white and blue lights. In the mid-ground, a large, open-trussed structure is lit by powerful blue spotlights that project beams into the rainy sky. A prominent white digital billboard displays the black text \"OFF WORLD\" and \"30 MIN. LEFT\" next to a graphic of a palm tree. The foreground is defined by the character's silhouette and the partial view of a vehicle with a pinkish-red fin and glowing red lights.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
