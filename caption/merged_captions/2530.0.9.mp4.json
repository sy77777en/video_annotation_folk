  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, focuses on the lower legs and feet of a group of basketball players standing on a light-colored ground. A player wearing shiny, metallic blue basketball shoes with yellow soles is positioned in the center middle ground. To the left, another player stands in the middle ground, wearing silver and black shoes, while a third player's legs, clad in black leggings, are in the right foreground. Positioned behind these three players, other players are visible, extending from the middle ground to the background. All the players are arranged in neat, organized rows, forming a grid pattern. The players dribble basketballs in unison on a grey paved surface outdoors, with the basketballs bouncing up and down simultaneously in a rhythmic, coordinated drill. The players' legs remain largely stationary, bending slightly at the knees in time with the dribbling. One ball creates a prominent motion blur in the right foreground. The bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of the players and the bouncing balls onto the ground before them, stretching toward the bottom of the frame. From a smooth, hip-level high angle, the camera moves forward and to the left through the group, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the players' legs and the dribbling balls in sharp detail. The high-angle view emphasizes the players' lower bodies, with multiple orange basketballs in motion, being dribbled by the players. The scene captures the dynamic energy of the drill, with the players' dark shadows cast on the surface in front of them, creating a visually striking pattern on the bright, sunny day.",

    "Scene": "From a hip-level high angle on a bright, sunny day, a group of people stands on a grey paved surface outdoors. The scene focuses on their lower legs and athletic shoes as they rhythmically dribble basketballs in unison. The bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of the players and the bouncing balls onto the ground. A pair of shiny, metallic blue basketball shoes with yellow soles is visible in the center, while the basketballs are in constant motion, some appearing as blurs.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
