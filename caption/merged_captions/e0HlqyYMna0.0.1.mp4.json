  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the tip of a snowboard occupies the bottom foreground, initially positioned slightly left of center. The snowboarder's shadow is cast into the bottom right foreground. The vast, snowy slope fills the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, where a single track is visible in the center-left. In the background, large, snow-covered mountains are visible across the top of the frame. As the camera moves forward and down the slope, the snowboard shifts toward the bottom center of the frame, passing by two adjacent exposed rocks located in the right middle ground. The unsteady, first-person point-of-view shot is captured from an eye-level camera looking down from a high angle. The camera moves forward and down, following the snowboarder's descent, with a varying Dutch angle created by the camera rolling with the rider's movements. A deep focus keeps the entire snowy mountain landscape sharp. The snowboarder begins to slide forward, descending a vast, snow-covered mountain slope. The snowboarder glides smoothly down the mountain, following tracks in the snow that vary in depth. The snowboarder's legs, clad in dark pants and boots, are visible at the bottom of the view, strapped to a snowboard that has a black and white graphic design. The board is pointed down a steep, wide slope of white snow, which is textured with ripples and several tracks leading downward. The snowboarder's shadow on the snow reveals that the person is wearing a beanie with a small pom-pom on top, along with winter clothing and gloves. The surrounding environment consists of immense, snow-covered mountains and rocky outcrops under a light blue sky.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a descent down a vast, snow-covered mountain on a clear, sunny day. The bright sunlight casts a distinct shadow of the individual onto the pristine white snow ahead. The landscape is a wide, open expanse of deep snow, with multiple tracks of varying depth leading down the steep slope. In the distance, towering, jagged mountain peaks, also blanketed in snow, form the horizon. A few dark, rocky outcrops emerge from the otherwise uniform white terrain. The tip of a dark-colored snowboard with white graphics is visible at the bottom of the view as it glides over the textured snow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
