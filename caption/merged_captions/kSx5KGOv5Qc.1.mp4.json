  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from a high angle, focusing on the scenery with no single main subject. Initially, a rocky hillside with green trees occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The middle ground features the deep blue Adriatic Sea, with the large, green, forested island of Lokrum in the upper-left to center and a historic walled city with orange-red terracotta roofs in the bottom right. A large white cruise ship is visible in the middle ground to the left. The camera, from a high aerial angle, captures the scene with deep focus, keeping both the foreground hillside and the distant city and island sharp. It smoothly tilts down and pans right, gradually shifting the view from the island of Lokrum to focus more on the historic walled city of Dubrovnik below. This slow, scenic pan shot moves from left to right, tilting downward slightly to reveal a stunning aerial view of the coastal city and nearby island. The shot captures the serene beauty of the landscape, though there is a slight unsteadiness in the camera movement. As the camera moves, it reveals the dense cluster of buildings enclosed by massive, light-colored stone walls and a bustling harbor with numerous docked boats nestled against the city. The camera's movement shifts the walled city and its harbor to the center and right of the frame, while the island moves to the top left. The foreground hillside expands to fill more of the bottom of the frame, and a tower structure appears in the bottom right corner by the end of the shot. A watermark for 'Xscion.org' with the word 'COPYRIGHT' is consistently positioned in the top left corner.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping panoramic landscape and cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high vantage point on a rocky, pine-dotted hillside. The view encompasses a historic walled city with a dense cluster of terracotta-roofed buildings nestled on a peninsula, complete with a bustling harbor filled with boats. Beyond the city lies the deep blue expanse of the sea, where a large, verdant island sits prominently offshore, accompanied by a few scattered boats, including a large ship and several smaller boats. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the grand scale and picturesque setting of the location. The focus is on the harmonious composition of the natural and man-made elements. The camera's slow pan across the vista emphasizes the expansive environment rather than a specific entity.",

    "Scene": "From a high, rocky vantage point, the video pans slowly to the right across a scenic coastal landscape in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on a clear day. The deep blue Adriatic Sea fills the view, with the large, green, forested island of Lokrum situated prominently offshore. A white cruise ship and several smaller boats are visible on the water's surface. As the camera moves, it reveals the historic walled city, a dense cluster of buildings with orange-red terracotta roofs, enclosed by massive, light-colored stone walls. A harbor with numerous docked boats is nestled against the city. The foreground is a rugged hillside with green pine trees and rocky, brown earth. A watermark for 'Xscion.org' with the word 'COPYRIGHT' is visible as an overlay in the top left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
