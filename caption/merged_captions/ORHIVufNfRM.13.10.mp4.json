  "merged_caption": "This video is framed from a first-person perspective, looking out through the red-edged viewport of a mask or submersible. The scene is set in a dark, underwater environment, with the sandy seafloor occupying the lower half of the frame, sloping down from left to right. In the middle ground, two prominent clusters of glowing organisms are positioned in the top left and bottom right, with the bottom-right group eventually moving out of the frame. Smaller, dimmer clusters and blue crystalline structures are scattered between them. The background consists of dark, deep water. A pair of red-gloved hands enters the frame from the bottom center foreground, waving gently. Throughout the shot, the camera pans slightly, shifting the view across the bioluminescent scenery. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, looking slightly downward at the immediate seafloor and forward into the open water. From a smooth, underwater, first-person perspective, the camera moves slowly forward and pans left to explore the environment. The camera maintains a level angle but rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set underwater in a dark, open environment. The scene is illuminated by clusters of small, glowing blue and white organisms scattered across the sandy ocean floor and attached to rocks, creating a soft, bioluminescent effect. The water appears deep and shadowy, with limited visibility beyond the immediate area. Occasional patches of blue coral-like structures and other marine life are visible, adding texture and variety to the seafloor. The lower edge of the view is partially framed by the dark, rounded outline of a mask or helmet, enhancing the immersive perspective and considered an overlay element, similar to the faint watermark with the text \"Loopy Longplay\" in the lower left corner, which is not part of the underwater scene.",

    "Subject": "This video is a first-person perspective shot from within a diving suit or submersible, framed by the red edges of a mask or viewport. The only visible part of the person is their hands, which are covered in red gloves. The hands appear from the bottom of the frame and simply wave in the water. The small, glowing blue crystalline objects floating in the dark water appear to be groups of fish.",
    "Motion": "Two hands covered in red gloves rise into view from the bottom of the frame and wave gently in the water. Multiple groups of small, glowing blue objects drift slowly through the dark water, moving together in loose clusters.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
