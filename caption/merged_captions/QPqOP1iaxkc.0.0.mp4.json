  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot framed symmetrically from within the light-blue steel truss structure of the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City. An overhead beam with blue graffiti is positioned in the top foreground, while the bridge's supports create a repeating pattern on the left and right, extending from the foreground into the background. Centered in the frame, a silver subway train with a yellow front travels from the middle ground toward the camera on tracks that run down the middle of the scene. To the left and right of the tracks, roadways with cars are visible extending from the foreground into the background, flanked by pink railings. The camera is positioned above the train, looking ahead along the length of the bridge, maintaining a level angle while performing a subtle downward tilt, capturing the train tracks below. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, from the graffiti on the bridge's structure to the approaching train, in sharp detail. The bright sunlight casts long, dramatic shadows across the entire structure, emphasizing the intricate, riveted beams and creating a powerful sense of depth and industrial geometry. The focus is on the grand scale and atmosphere of the urban infrastructure rather than a specific subject; the approaching train is an integral part of the environment, emphasizing the bridge's function and the city's constant motion. The scene extends into the distance toward the city skyline, with the bright, sunny day enhancing the vividness of the colors and the clarity of the details. The video captures the dynamic interplay of movement and structure, with the train and cars in motion against the static, symmetrical backdrop of the bridge.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, mostly static shot taken from an overhead position on a bridge. The camera maintains a level angle while performing a subtle downward tilt, capturing the train tracks below. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, from the graffiti on the bridge's structure to the approaching train, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot from a static, symmetrical viewpoint within the light-blue steel truss structure of a bridge. A subway train with illuminated headlights travels towards the camera on tracks that run down the center of the frame, while cars are visible on roadways to both the left and right. The intricate, riveted beams of the bridge, one of which is marked with blue graffiti, create a powerful sense of depth and industrial geometry, complemented by the pink railings lining the walkways on either side. The focus is on the grand scale and atmosphere of the urban infrastructure rather than a specific subject; the approaching train is an integral part of the environment, emphasizing the bridge's function and the city's constant motion.",
    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view shot from within the steel superstructure of a large bridge, looking down its length. Graffiti is visible on an overhead beam, and below, train tracks run down the center, flanked by roadways and pink railings. A subway train is positioned on the tracks, moving towards the camera, while on both sides of the frame, cars can be seen traveling back and forth. The bright sunlight casts long, dramatic shadows across the entire structure.",
    "Scene": "From a perspective within the framework of the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City, the view looks straight down its length on a bright, sunny day. The light-blue steel truss structure, detailed with rivets, creates a repeating, symmetrical pattern, with an overhead beam marked by blue graffiti. In the center, a silver subway train with a yellow front travels on a set of tracks, moving toward the camera's position. Flanking the tracks are roadways with vehicle traffic, and the outer edges of the bridge are lined with pink safety fencing. The bright sunlight casts strong, linear shadows across the entire scene, which extends into the distance toward the city skyline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
