  "merged_caption": "In this low-quality, greenish-tinted video, a full shot captures a dark-colored dog with a long body, short hair, and tan markings on its underside, suspended in the middle ground at the center of the frame. The dog, wearing a collar, remains completely still with its paws consistently pointing downward. A person's right hand and arm, light-skinned, are positioned in the middle ground to the left, poised to hug the dog but not making contact. The scene is set indoors with a yellowish floor and light-colored walls, featuring a thin, vertical pole effect centrally positioned around which the dog appears suspended. Indistinct furniture, including an object resembling a blackboard, is visible in the background. The video is presented within a black frame. The camera begins with an unsteady, high-angle shot looking down at the dog from above. It then cranes upward in a shaky arc, transitioning from an overhead view to an underbelly view, shifting the perspective from eye level to hip level. The movement concludes with an upside-down, low-angle view looking up at the animal, changing the camera's height from above the subject to below it. Meanwhile, the person's left hand moves through the left foreground as the camera shifts in the middle of the video. A deep focus keeps the entire scene relatively sharp throughout the motion.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady, high-angle shot begins by looking down at a dog frozen in mid-air. The camera then cranes upward in a shaky arc around the dog, transitioning from eye level to hip level. The movement concludes with an upside-down, low-angle view looking up at the animal. A deep focus keeps the entire scene relatively sharp throughout the motion.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of this low-quality, greenish-tinted video is a dark-colored dog with a long body, short hair, and tan markings on its underside. The dog, which wears a collar, remains completely still in the air while the camera performs a vertical circular motion around a central vertical pole. A person, of whom only light-skinned hands and forearms are visible, appears poised to hug the dog but does not touch or manipulate it.",
    "Motion": "The dog appears suspended in the air as the camera cranes upward to provide a different perspective. The dog's paws consistently point downward, and a person's hands are held near the dog's body without making contact.",
    "Scene": "This indoor scene is captured with a grainy, yellowish-green tint characteristic of older video formats. The setting features a yellowish floor and light-colored walls. A thin, vertical pole effect is centrally positioned in the frame, around which a dark-colored dog appears to be suspended in the air. A person, whose hands and arms are partially visible, remains static and poised to hold the dog. In the background, indistinct furniture includes an object resembling a blackboard. The entire video is presented within a black frame.",
    "Spatial": "In this full shot, a dog is suspended in the middle ground at the center of the frame, with a person's right hand and arm positioned in the middle ground to the left. The camera, initially positioned above the dog, cranes upward, shifting the perspective on the stationary dog from an overhead view to an underbelly view, changing the camera's height from above the subject to below it. Meanwhile, the person's left hand moves through the left foreground as the camera shifts in the middle of the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
