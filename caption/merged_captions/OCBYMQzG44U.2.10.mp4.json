  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective, positioned just above the water level. Initially, the bottom half of the frame is occupied by water, which extends from the foreground to the middle ground. A platform with a railing is visible in the right foreground. In the middle ground, two brightly lit, window-like light sources are on the left side of the frame, and a dark, arched doorway is positioned on the right-center of the background. The camera, which features mild barrel distortion, smoothly follows the player moving forward down a set of stairs and into a pool, making slight, mouse-like tilts and pans. It begins at eye-level and transitions to just above the water, maintaining a level angle and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera then moves steadily forward through the water, causing the platform on the right to exit the frame. As the camera advances, the arched doorway enlarges and transitions from the background to the middle ground, while the light sources on the left shift toward the periphery of the frame. The serene indoor pool area features tiled walls and soft natural light streaming through a window, enhancing the tranquil and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.",

    "Camera": "This first-person game camera shot smoothly follows the player moving forward down a set of stairs and into a pool.

    "Subject": "The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water.

    "Motion": "The video features a serene indoor pool area with tiled walls and soft natural light streaming through a window. The water is calm, and there is a dark arched passageway partially submerged at the far end of the room. The camera slowly moves closer to the passageway, enhancing the tranquil and mysterious atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a room partially filled with dark green water. The walls and curved ceiling are covered in a grid of small, light-colored tiles. On the left wall, two arched windows emit a bright, diffuse white light that reflects on the rippling water's surface. Directly ahead, a dark, arched doorway is partially submerged in the water. To the right, a white platform with a simple metal railing stands above the water level. The perspective advances steadily through the water toward the dark archway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
