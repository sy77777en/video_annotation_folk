  "merged_caption": "The video shows a large, classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball, featuring a small green and yellow emblem, positioned on the left side of the frame. To the right, two men in athletic attire are running, with the man in a white jersey with black trim and the number \"7\" on the left, and the man in a red jersey with black trim and the number \"18\" on the right. The green soccer field spans the bottom of the frame. The background features white and black checkered walls at the top, with blue geometric shapes visible on the right. The camera smoothly tracks backward, capturing the animated soccer players running towards the soccer ball, which appears large due to its proximity to the lens. The soccer ball rolls forward on the bright green field, maintaining a consistent distance from the two men. The first man has white, medium-length hair and wears a white jersey with black trim and the number \"7\" in black on the chest, over a black and blue striped long-sleeved undershirt, with white shorts and black shoes with white laces. The second man has black spiky hair with an undercut and wears a red jersey with black trim and the number \"18\" in black on the chest, over a black long-sleeved undershirt, with red shorts and white shoes. The background consists of a large, white, grid-like structure, suggesting an indoor or controlled environment. The scene takes place indoors on a bright green soccer grassland, with the soccer ball rolling across the green surface as the two figures run alongside it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
