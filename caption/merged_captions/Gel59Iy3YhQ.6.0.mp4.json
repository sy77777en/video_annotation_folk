  "merged_caption": "In the wide shot, two animated characters are positioned in the middle ground of a dimly lit, cavernous room with a high, A-frame ceiling. The character with reddish-brown hair is on the left, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket, while the character with bright green hair is slightly to the right and behind, wearing a red long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants. Both characters stand completely still, facing forward towards the two large blackboards on the far wall, which are in the background. The left blackboard features white chalk drawings, including a circle hanging from the end of a horizontal arm. A single reddish-orange lamp above them casts a spotlight, creating a clear focal point on the characters and the blackboards, while leaving the periphery in deep shadow. Banners hang from the exposed wooden beams above. The room is cluttered, with a large, disorganized pile of chairs on the left and a single chair on the right in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a consistent view throughout the scene, with a slightly unsteady shot from an overhead perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear, with the shakiness being the only form of camera movement present. High windows on the far wall show a dark sky, adding to the dimly lit atmosphere. The reddish-orange lamp's spotlight highlights the characters and the blackboards, emphasizing the central area of the room. The camera's deep focus ensures that all elements, including the high ceiling, hanging banners, and cluttered chairs, remain in sharp detail, contributing to the overall composition and environment of the scene.",

    "Subject": "Two animated characters stand in a dimly lit room, facing away from the camera towards two chalkboards.

To the right and slightly behind stands a second character with bright green hair, wearing a red long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants. Both figures are standing still.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit, cavernous room with a high, A-frame ceiling, a single reddish-orange lamp casts a spotlight on the central area, leaving the periphery in deep shadow. Banners hang from the exposed wooden beams above. On the far wall, beneath high windows showing a dark sky, are two large blackboards. The left blackboard features white chalk drawings, including a circle hanging from the end of a horizontal arm. The room is cluttered, with a large, disorganized pile of chairs on the left and a single chair on the right. Two figures, one with reddish hair and another with green hair, stand within the pool of light, facing the blackboards.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
