  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames a man in military gear in the left foreground, who is partially out of focus. The main subject, a middle-aged woman with dark hair styled in a bun, is positioned in the center of the frame, strongly backlit by a bright light originating from the background. She wears a light-colored, button-up jacket over a darker shirt. In the right background, a large, dark helicopter with its side door open and another soldier in military attire are visible. The scene is set outdoors at night in a hazy or dusty environment, with a powerful, bright white light creating illuminated haze and casting long shadows. A faint red light is visible from within the helicopter's cabin. Subtitles are located at the bottom of the frame with the name \"Price\" in green text, followed by \"I'll call you if I need you.\" in white text. The woman, initially standing still and looking toward the man in the foreground, turns to her right and begins to walk away, moving deeper into the background. The man in the foreground, who has a thick, dark beard and is dressed in military gear, including a tactical vest and a dark beanie, turns to his right, walks toward the camera, and eventually exits the frame. Meanwhile, the figure in the background initially stands near the helicopter and then jumps onto it. The camera, at eye level with a level angle and shallow depth of field, smoothly pans right while trucking left to maintain the woman's position in the center of the frame as she turns away.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the woman in the midground in focus. The camera smoothly pans right while trucking left to keep the woman centered in the frame as she turns away.",

    "Scene": "This is an outdoor night scene set in a hazy or dusty environment. In the background, a large, dark helicopter is parked with its side door open. A powerful, bright white light emanates from behind a central figure, creating a strong backlight that fills the air with illuminated haze and casts long shadows. A faint red light is visible originating from within the helicopter's cabin. A man wearing a dark beanie and tactical vest is partially visible in the foreground. A subtitle overlay is present at the bottom of the screen with the name \"Price\" in green text, followed by \"I'll call you if I need you.\" in white text.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot frames a man in military gear in the left foreground, who is partially out of focus. The main subject, a woman, is positioned in the center of the frame, strongly backlit by a bright light originating from the background. In the right background, a helicopter and another soldier are visible. Subtitles are located at the bottom of the frame. The woman, initially facing the man, turns to her right and walks away, moving deeper into the background. The camera pans right while trucking left to maintain the woman's position in the center of the frame as she turns away."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
