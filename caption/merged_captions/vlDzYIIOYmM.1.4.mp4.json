  "merged_caption": "This medium shot initially frames three women from the thighs up in the center foreground on a wet, sandy beach during sunset. The woman on the left has light skin and long, dark hair, wearing a white, long-sleeved cover-up over a pink bikini top and patterned bottoms, with one hand on her hip. In the center, a woman with a medium skin tone wears a wide-brimmed hat and a green t-shirt with sunglasses hanging from the collar, holding a black object, possibly a phone. To her left, a woman with dark skin and long, dark hair, dressed in a sleeveless, lime-green top, leans in to look at the object. The foreground and middle ground consist of the shoreline, with other people scattered in the water and on the sand to both sides. In the middle ground and background, trees and beachside structures are visible. The setting sun is positioned slightly left of center at the beginning, creating a strong glare over the water and reflecting golden light on the wet sand. The camera performs a smooth counterclockwise arc around the three women, moving from an oblique angle to their left side profile, keeping the group in the center of the frame, and eventually moving the sun to the center-right. During this movement, the sun occasionally becomes obscured behind the hat or head of the women. The woman on the left lowers her arm and leans forward, while the woman on the right also leans in closer to view the object. The woman in the middle continues to look at the object and smile along with the others. This slow-motion, eye-level, level-angle video is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire beach scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "Three women stand close together on a wet, sandy beach, their bodies visible from the thighs up. The woman on the left has light skin and long, dark hair. She wears a white, long-sleeved cover-up open over a pink bikini top and patterned bottoms, and she stands with one hand on her hip at first. In the center, a woman with a medium skin tone wears a wide-brimmed hat and a green t-shirt with sunglasses hanging from the collar. She holds a black object, possibly a phone, and looks down at it. To her left, a woman with dark skin and long, dark hair, dressed in a sleeveless, lime-green top, leans in to look at the object as well.",
    "Motion": "Three women stand together on a wet beach, looking down at a black object held by the woman in the center. The woman on the left, initially with a hand on her hip, lowers her arm and leans forward. The woman on the right also leans in closer to view the object. The woman in the middle, holding the object, continues to look at the object and smile along with the others.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a wide, sandy beach during sunset, with the bright sun low on the horizon creating a strong glare over the water. The wet sand at the water's edge reflects the golden light. In the foreground, three young women stand together in the shallow surf. The background and middleground include a line of trees, simple beachside structures, and other people scattered along the shore and in the water. The camera's perspective shifts as it arcs counter-clockwise around the three women, moving from an oblique angle to their left side profile.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
