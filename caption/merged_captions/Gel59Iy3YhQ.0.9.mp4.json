  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a small, cloaked figure resembling a bird on the left and a much larger, imposing figure on the right, both positioned in the middle ground on a light-colored plateau. The smaller figure carries a sword that emits a bright purple glow on its back, while the larger figure, enveloped in a heavy cloak of large, overlapping grey feathers or scales and adorned with horns or antlers, holds a large, simple sword. A floating, dark, rectangular monolith is centered in front of them in the middle ground, set against a backdrop of jagged, dark green mountains under a pale green, cloudy sky. The monolith's surface is covered in a network of glowing red and pink cracks resembling lightning. The camera moves forward slightly with a bit of unsteadiness before pausing. As the monolith trembles and the black pillar in the center falls, both figures turn their heads toward the center, seemingly trying to avoid looking directly at the intense light emitted by the monolith. The camera rapidly zooms in, shaking intensely upon the pillar's impact with the ground. The scene then transitions abruptly, plunging the background into complete darkness. The monolith transforms into a tall, brilliant white, arched doorway from which white lines streak outwards to the edges of the frame, while the two figures remain still, maintaining their respective left and right positions in the middle ground.",

    "Subject": "A small, cloaked figure and a much larger, imposing figure stand side by side. The smaller figure resembles a bird, with a black and white appearance, and carries a sword that emits a bright purple glow on its back. The larger figure is enveloped in a heavy cloak composed of large, overlapping grey feathers or scales, and its head is adorned with horns or antlers. It holds a large, simple sword. A tall, dark, rectangular monolith with a rounded top is positioned in front of them, its surface covered in a network of glowing red and pink cracks resembling lightning. The monolith transitions into a brilliant white light.",
    "Motion": "Two figures, one small and one large, stand on a hilltop before a dark, rectangular monolith that floats in the air as red, lightning-like energy crackles across its surface. As the monolith trembles, both figures turn their heads toward the center, seemingly trying to avoid looking directly at the intense light emitted by the monolith. The scene then abruptly transforms, with the monolith becoming a brilliant white, arched doorway against a completely black background. As this happens, white lines extend from the bright white monolith to the edges of the frame, while the two figures remain still.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set on a light-colored plateau against a backdrop of jagged, dark green mountains under a pale green, cloudy sky. A tall, black, rectangular monolith with a cracked texture floats in the center, with glowing pink energy coursing through its fissures. The scene then transitions abruptly, plunging the background into complete darkness. The monolith transforms into a tall, arched doorway of brilliant white light, from which white lines streak outwards. Two figures, one small and one large, stand on the plateau before this shifting structure.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a small figure on the left and a large figure on the right, both positioned in the middle ground on a plateau. A floating monolith is centered in front of them in the middle ground, set against a background of mountains. The scene then transitions, and while the figures maintain their respective left and right positions in the middle ground, the background becomes black and the central monolith transforms into a tall, bright white doorway from which white lines radiate outwards."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
