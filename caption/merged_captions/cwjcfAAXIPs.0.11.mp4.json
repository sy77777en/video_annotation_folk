  "merged_caption": "From a first-person point of view, a pair of light-skinned hands holding a black, mirrorless-style digital camera occupies the foreground. The left hand is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, supporting the camera from below, while the right hand grips it from the center-right. The camera itself is held in the center of the frame, its flip-out screen displaying a live view of the background scene. In the middle ground, a large tree is silhouetted on the left side by the rising sun, with buildings lining a stone promenade to the left and a river and hillside to the right. A dark pole stands in the left middle ground. The hands and camera remain relatively static with slight adjustments, tilting the camera up and down as if to perfect the composition for a photograph, filmed from the eye level. Shot from a fixed but slightly unsteady eye-level perspective, the video maintains a level view with a slight Dutch angle. Mild barrel distortion is present, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping everything from the photographer's hands in the foreground to the cityscape in the background sharp. The scene captures a person holding a black camera on a stone promenade in Porto, Portugal, during sunrise. The sun is low on the horizon, creating a bright flare and silhouetting a large, prominent tree against a clear blue sky. To the left, traditional European buildings line the waterfront, while across the river, a hillside covered with buildings is visible. The person is composing a shot, and the camera's screen displays a live view of the sunlit scene with the silhouetted tree. The brand name \"SONY\" is visible in white letters on the bottom bezel of the screen.",

    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands holds a camera relatively steady, pointing it toward a sunrise over a city waterfront. The hands make very slight, subtle adjustments, tilting the camera up and down as if to perfect the composition for a photograph.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
