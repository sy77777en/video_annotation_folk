  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot from a low angle, initially framing a large, ornate fountain in the foreground, with its base occupying the immediate front of the scene. The fountain, known as the Fontaine des Mers at Place de la Concorde in Paris, is illuminated by golden and white lights, highlighting its detailed carvings and smooth, reflective surfaces. On the left, a brightly lit Ferris wheel with a circular shape and multicolored lights is positioned in the middle ground, adding a dynamic and festive atmosphere. The camera executes a smooth, counterclockwise arc around the fountain, expanding the frame to reveal more of the environment. As the shot widens, an obelisk becomes visible in the right background, positioned opposite the Ferris wheel. The Eiffel Tower is visible in the far background on the right side at the beginning of the video, contributing to the iconic Parisian skyline. The scene is vibrant, showcasing the city’s landmarks under the night sky, with scattered clouds and artificial lights creating starburst effects around the square. The movement shows more of the foreground platform and surrounding sculptures across the bottom of the scene, which is wet and reflects the lights from nearby sources. This time-lapse video, captured from a low, eye-level angle, presents the scene with a deep focus, ensuring all elements from the foreground fountain to the background Ferris wheel remain sharp. Overlay elements include a static watermark with the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" in white, located in the lower right corner, with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it, which is not part of the scene itself.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment at night. The scene features a grand, ornately decorated fountain with intricate sculptures and golden accents, illuminated by artificial lighting that highlights its architectural details. In the background, a large Ferris wheel adorned with colorful lights adds a dynamic and festive atmosphere, while the night sky and scattered clouds contribute to the overall ambiance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the interplay of architectural elements, lighting, and the lively city atmosphere rather than any specific object or individual. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of scale and vibrancy within the urban setting.",
    "Motion": "This video features a nighttime scenery shot of the Fontaine des Mers at Place de la Concorde in Paris. The illuminated fountain is prominently displayed, with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background at the beginning of the video and a brightly lit Ferris wheel appearing shortly after. The scene is vibrant, showcasing the city’s iconic landmarks under the night sky.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors at night in a city square, featuring a large, ornate fountain with multiple tiers and sculpted figures at its base. The fountain is illuminated by golden and white lights, highlighting its detailed carvings and smooth, reflective surfaces. Surrounding the fountain is a raised platform constructed around it, which is wet and reflects the lights from nearby sources. In the background, a tall obelisk and a brightly lit Ferris wheel with a circular shape and multicolored lights are visible, adding to the urban atmosphere. At the beginning of the video, the Eiffel Tower is also visible in the background. The sky is dark with scattered clouds, and artificial lights create starburst effects around the square. Overlay elements include a watermark with the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" in white, located in the lower right corner, with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it, which is not part of the scene itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
