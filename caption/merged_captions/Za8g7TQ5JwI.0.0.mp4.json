  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of the side of a black, modified off-road vehicle, a Mahindra Thar, with its front fender and wheel positioned on the left side of the frame and the door in the upper right. The vehicle, featuring a hardtop, prominent external door hinges, and custom metal tube side steps, is parked on a sandy, unpaved surface and remains stationary throughout the scene. The camera, from a shaky, hip-level perspective at a level angle, maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the vehicle in focus. It first arcs counterclockwise around the side of the vehicle, capturing the large, knobby tires mounted on black rims with a thin red accent line. The camera then moves backward, away from the vehicle, pulling back to a medium shot that captures the vehicle's full side profile, which initially appears in the middle of the scene and eventually is positioned in the center and upper right side of the frame. On the body panel behind the front fender, there is a silver \"THAR CRDe\" emblem positioned above a white rectangular sticker with an \"ADVISORY\" label. The dusty ground occupies the foreground at the bottom, with sparse green foliage visible in the background against a clear sky. The camera is positioned at the vehicle's level, providing a comprehensive view of the vehicle's features and the sunlit, outdoor setting.",

    "Motion": "A black off-road vehicle appears to be stationary on a sandy, unpaved surface. The camera begins with a close-up of the front part of the vehicle, arcs counterclockwise, and then transitions to a backward movement along the side of the vehicle.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit, outdoor setting, a black off-road vehicle with a hardtop is parked on a dusty, unpaved path. The vehicle is equipped with large, knobby tires on black rims and features a silver \"THAR\" emblem and a black-and-white advisory-style sticker on its side. In the background, sparse green foliage is visible against a clear sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
