  "merged_caption": "A woman is positioned in the foreground of the frame in a medium shot, standing against a black background with a large, blue-lit structure visible to the right in the background. She is seen in profile, looking toward the left side of the frame. The woman, a light-skinned, middle-aged individual with straight, shoulder-length blonde hair, wears a brown, long-sleeved, V-neck top with small, metallic-looking details on the shoulders and a wide, brown belt cinched at her waist. Her left hand is on her hip, and she holds a small black object, possibly a presentation clicker, in her right hand, which also has a dark bracelet on the wrist. The scene is lit to highlight the speaker, while the rest of the environment remains in shadow. The camera captures this at an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, performing a smooth, minor pan from right to left to follow the woman's movement on stage. As she turns to her right and takes small steps forward, the camera continues to pan left, maintaining her position in the frame and ensuring the large, blue-lit structure remains visible in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
