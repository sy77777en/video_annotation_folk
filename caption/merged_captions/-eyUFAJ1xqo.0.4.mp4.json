  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman with light skin and shoulder-length, wavy blonde hair with bangs, wearing a black sleeveless top. She is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, facing forward with a serious expression. The scene takes place inside a crowded, dimly lit nightclub, saturated with vibrant neon lighting, casting a strong contrast of deep red and bright cyan hues. Vertical cyan lights are located in the upper left, and red lighting is on the right. To her left, a man with dark hair and a dark turtleneck is partially visible in profile, also in the middle ground. The background is filled with a crowd, with silhouettes and blurred figures of people dancing and moving, creating a dynamic and energetic atmosphere. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, low, eye-level angle, moves backward, leading the woman through the crowded, neon-lit space. It maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in focus while the background and other people are blurred. The woman stands still, looking forward, then turns her head slightly to the right, looking towards the right side of the frame. She walks toward the camera, moving through the surrounding people who are dancing. Individuals from the crowd consistently appear and move across the foreground. The shot concludes with her facing forward, centrally located and illuminated by blue and teal light, as the camera continues to move backward, maintaining her in focus amidst the ambient red and blue neon lighting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video features a woman with light skin and shoulder-length, wavy blonde hair with bangs as the main subject. She is wearing a black sleeveless top and stands facing forward with a serious expression, centrally located and illuminated by blue and teal light. In the background, a crowded, dimly lit environment, likely a nightclub, is filled with other people. To her left, a man with dark hair and a dark turtleneck is partially visible in profile. Other surrounding figures are less distinct, appearing as silhouettes or blurred forms, some seemingly dancing or socializing amidst the ambient red and blue neon lighting.",
    "Motion": "A woman with blonde hair stands still in a crowd, looking forward. She then turns her head slightly to the right, looking towards the right side of the frame. She walks toward the camera, moving through the surrounding people who are dancing.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a crowded, dimly lit nightclub, saturated with vibrant neon lighting. The environment is cast in a strong contrast of deep red and bright cyan hues. In the background, a series of vertical, glowing cyan light tubes are mounted on a dark wall, while another surface features what appears to be red-lit graffiti. The space is densely packed with the silhouettes and blurred figures of people dancing and moving, creating a dynamic and energetic atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To her left, a man is partially visible, also in the middle ground. The background is filled with a crowd, with vertical cyan lights located in the upper left and red lighting on the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
