  "merged_caption": "This is a static, worm's eye angle medium shot of four people grouped together in the foreground, looking down toward the camera. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping all the characters in the frame sharp and clear. A woman with an eyepatch occupies the left side of the frame, next to a woman with braids in the center-left. A man in a suit is positioned in the center, and another woman is on the right. The background, visible at the top of the frame, consists of a ceiling with exposed wooden beams. The scene is set indoors within a room featuring a ceiling with exposed wooden beams, where the dark, parallel rafters form a grid-like pattern against the warm-toned wood. The four individuals are mostly stationary, gazing down at the camera, but one man slightly moves his head and winks. On the far left is a light-skinned woman with long, straight blonde hair and a black eyepatch over her right eye, wearing a black ribbed top and a wide black belt. Next to her is a woman with a medium-dark skin tone and long, dark braided hair, wearing a black ribbed turtleneck. In the center is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with short dark hair, dressed in a black suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a black tie. On the far right is a light-skinned woman with East Asian features and long, dark, straight hair, wearing a black ribbed top and with her left hand on her hip. The four figures dressed predominantly in black are positioned in a semi-circle, looking down toward the camera's viewpoint.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
