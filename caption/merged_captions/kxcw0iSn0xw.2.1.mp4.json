  "merged_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a man on a gold-colored scooter with turquoise wheels in the center-right middle ground, positioned before a wooden ramp that extends from the middle ground. He wears a black helmet with white lettering, a black short-sleeved t-shirt, light-colored pants, and bright turquoise sneakers. Another man lies on the ground at the end of the ramp, on the left side of the middle ground, wearing blue jeans and dark boots. In the left middle ground, a third man stands near a silver pickup truck, holding up a phone as if to record the stunt, while a parking garage structure occupies the background. The scene takes place on the top level of a concrete parking garage under a clear blue sky on a sunny day, with white painted lines designating parking spaces, including the word \"COMPACT.\" The main subject rides the scooter toward the center, launches off the ramp, and performs a front flip in the center of the frame, moving slightly from right to left in the air before landing. While airborne, he holds onto the handlebars and performs a complete front flip, tucking his body as he and the scooter rotate forward together. He then lands back on the concrete on both wheels and rolls away. The camera, positioned at hip-level with a level-angle shot, smoothly pans left to track the man on the scooter, slowing down as he performs the mid-air trick. A deep focus keeps the entire parking garage scene sharp throughout the shot. In the background, a lower level of the parking structure is visible, containing parked vehicles such as a white van and a black pickup truck, some behind a metal fence and others outside of it.",

    "Camera": "This hip-level, level-angle shot uses a speed ramp effect. The camera smoothly pans left to track a man on a scooter, slowing down as he performs a mid-air trick. A deep focus keeps the entire parking garage scene sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a man performing a stunt on a scooter in a parking garage. He wears a black helmet with white lettering, a black short-sleeved t-shirt, light-colored pants, and bright turquoise sneakers. His scooter has a gold-colored frame, red handlebar grips, and turquoise wheels. The man rides toward a small wooden ramp and launches into the air, performing a front flip while holding onto the scooter. He performs this trick over another man who is lying face-up on the ground at the end of the ramp, wearing blue jeans and dark boots. In the middle ground, a third man stands near a silver pickup truck, holding up a phone as if to record the stunt.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place on the top level of a concrete parking garage under a clear blue sky on a sunny day. The ground is marked with white painted lines designating parking spaces, including the word \"COMPACT.\" A makeshift ramp made of light brown plywood is set up in an open area. In the background, a lower level of the parking structure is visible, containing parked vehicles such as a white van and a black pickup truck, some behind a metal fence and others outside of it. A person on a gold-colored scooter with turquoise wheels rides up the ramp, performs a front flip in mid-air, and lands. Another person lies on the ground at the end of the ramp, while a third individual stands near a silver truck in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
