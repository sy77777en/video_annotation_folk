  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a dynamic and vast scenery without a single main subject. A massive, dark storm cloud formation dominates the top, center, and right portions of the frame, while a smaller patch of white clouds and blue sky is visible in the top left. The foreground and middle ground consist of a flat plain occupying the bottom third of the frame. Along the horizon at the bottom, a band of golden light is visible, with shafts of light or rain descending from the cloud base in the bottom center. In this time-lapse video, the dark, ominous clouds churn and swirl rapidly across the sky, showcasing the storm's immense power and movement. The entire weather system evolves over the flat landscape as light and shadow shift dramatically. The camera, shot from a low angle, pans slowly and smoothly from right to left, capturing the turbulent movement of the clouds. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire dramatic sky and the distant horizon sharp. The sky is dominated by a colossal, swirling mass of dark grey and black clouds that churn and expand, with a small patch of blue sky visible to the left. The horizon is aglow with a bright, golden light from a low sun, which illuminates the base of the storm and casts shafts of light or rain onto the distant landscape. The dark, featureless ground stretches out below, emphasizing the immense scale of the dramatic weather formation in the sky. The movement is irregular and difficult to describe, emphasizing the scale and raw beauty of the natural environment over any single object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of a developing supercell storm over a flat, open plain. The sky is dominated by a colossal, swirling mass of dark grey and black clouds that churn and expand, with a small patch of blue sky visible to the left. Along the horizon, a warm, golden light illuminates the scene, contrasting sharply with the ominous clouds above, and bright shafts of what appears to be rain or sunlight break through the storm's base. There is no main subject in the traditional sense; the focus is entirely on the vast, atmospheric spectacle, emphasizing the scale and raw beauty of the natural environment over any single object.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a massive, rotating supercell thunderstorm. The dark, ominous clouds churn and swirl rapidly across the sky, showcasing the storm's immense power and movement.

    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a massive, turbulent storm system developing over a flat, open plain.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
