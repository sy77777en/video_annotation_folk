  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic Moon, depicted in black and white, positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. The Moon's surface is detailed with craters, forming a human-like face with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A large, dark, cylindrical object, shaped like a bullet or a rocket ship, is lodged directly in the Moon's right eye, which is closed as if in reaction, suggesting discomfort. Dark, swirling, cloud-like shapes frame the scene from the top, bottom, left, and right edges. As the video progresses, the Moon gradually grows larger and moves closer to the camera, subtly expressing discomfort through its facial expressions. The camera remains mostly stationary, though there are some unintentional unsteady movements, resulting in moments of slight shakiness and instability in the frame. The Moon continues to enlarge and move closer, eventually occupying a larger portion of the frame, while the dark clouds maintain their position, framing the image from the edges. The camera is positioned at the subject's height, capturing the Moon's detailed, textured surface and its anthropomorphic features.",

    "Camera": "The camera remains mostly stationary, though there are some unintentional unsteady movements.",
    "Subject": "The central subject is an anthropomorphic Moon, depicted in black and white with a textured, cratered surface that forms a human-like face. This face has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A large, dark, cylindrical object, shaped like a bullet or a rocket ship, is lodged directly in the Moon's right eye, which is closed as if in reaction. The Moon's overall facial expression suggests discomfort.",
    "Motion": "The anthropomorphic moon, with a rocket lodged in its eye, gradually grows larger and moves closer to the camera, subtly expressing discomfort through its facial expressions. While the surrounding clouds are mostly static, there are moments of slight shakiness and instability in the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a black and white, stylized scene, a large, textured moon with an anthropomorphic face is centered against a black background. The moon's surface is detailed with craters, and it features two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A dark, cylindrical, projectile-like object is lodged in the moon's right eye. The entire scene is framed by dark, swirling, cloud-like shapes that encircle the central image.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic moon positioned in the center of the frame, with a projectile lodged in its right eye. Dark, swirling clouds frame the scene from the top, bottom, left, and right edges. The moon then appears to enlarge and move closer to the camera, resulting in a full shot where it occupies a larger portion of the frame. The clouds continue to frame the image from the edges. The camera is positioned at the subject's height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
