  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, low-angle scenery shot of an illuminated basilica and an equestrian statue against a dark night sky. Both the basilica and the statue are positioned in the middle ground, with the basilica occupying the right side of the frame and the statue in the bottom right. The dark sky fills the left and top portions of the frame, acting as the background. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in, causing the basilica and statue to grow larger and fill more of the frame, with the statue shifting slightly toward the center-right. The basilica's white stone facade, featuring intricate carvings, arched windows, and a domed tower, glows against the dark, cloudy sky. The equestrian statue, bathed in a cool, blue-green light, depicts a figure on horseback holding a cross. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" with \"PHOTOGRAPHY\" underneath. The composition emphasizes the grandeur of the location and the moody, reverent atmosphere created by the dramatic lighting and scale.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a slow, smooth zoom-in on a grand, illuminated basilica at night. On the right side of the frame, the building's white stone facade, featuring intricate carvings, arched windows, and a domed tower, glows against the dark, cloudy sky. Positioned in front of the basilica is a large, verdigris-patinated equestrian statue, bathed in a cool, blue-green light, depicting a figure on horseback holding a cross. The focus is on the majestic architectural environment and the moody, reverent atmosphere created by the dramatic lighting and scale. The composition emphasizes the grandeur of the location rather than a specific object or character.",
    "Motion": "This is a low-angle shot of a grand, illuminated basilica at night. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in while maintaining a deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp. An equestrian statue with a green patina is positioned in the middle ground against the dark sky.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, nighttime view captures a section of the illuminated, white-stone facade of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Paris against a dark, cloudy sky. To the right of the frame, a large equestrian statue with a greenish-blue patina stands on a pedestal in front of the building. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in while maintaining deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" with \"PHOTOGRAPHY\" underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
