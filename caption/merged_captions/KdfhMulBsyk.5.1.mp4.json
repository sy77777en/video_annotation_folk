  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a vibrant cityscape at night from a drone's bird's-eye view. Initially, the frame is filled with neon lights in various colors, such as red, purple, green, and yellow, reflecting off surfaces and creating a dynamic atmosphere. The camera begins with a close-up shot of a building, capturing the intricate details of its illuminated facade. As the camera moves upward, it transitions to an extreme wide shot, revealing the illuminated rooftops and windows of buildings. The neon lights and street lamps line the roads, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The movement of cars and lights is visible in the background, contributing to the energy of the city. The camera, likely a drone, continuously ascends, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. During this ascent, it rolls counterclockwise to align a road parallel to the frame, continues its upward movement, and then rolls counterclockwise again, all while maintaining its ascent. The camera movement is very smooth. The scene is further enhanced by the movement of vehicles along the illuminated roads, including one car and one truck traveling from right to left, and another car moving from left to right. Their headlights add to the vibrant array of lights, contributing to the overall dynamic feel of the city. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the urban landscape. The overall blurriness adds a dreamlike quality to the cityscape, blending the middle ground and background into a cohesive visual experience. The video features white overlay bars at the top and bottom of the frame, framing the scene with a cinematic touch.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. Filmed from an aerial, bird's-eye view, the entire scene is blurry. The camera, likely a drone, continuously ascends. During this ascent, it rolls counterclockwise to align a road parallel to the frame, continues its upward movement, and then rolls counterclockwise again, all while maintaining its ascent. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video is a vibrant cityscape scenery shot, capturing the dynamic and colorful essence of an urban environment at night. Neon lights in various hues of red, purple, green, and yellow illuminate the scene, reflecting off surfaces and creating a lively, almost surreal atmosphere. On the road, a car and a truck travel from right to left, while another car moves from left to right, their headlights adding to the dynamic interplay of neon lights. This movement further enhances the vibrant and lively atmosphere of the cityscape. The focus is on the interplay of lights and colors rather than any specific object, emphasizing the bustling energy and scale of the city. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall ambiance and the intricate patterns formed by the lights and structures.",
    "Motion": "The video features a vibrant, colorful cityscape at night, with neon lights and blurred motion effects creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere. The scene is further enhanced by the movement of vehicles along the illuminated roads, including one car and one truck traveling from right to left, and another car moving from left to right. Their headlights add to the vibrant array of lights, contributing to the overall dynamic feel of the city.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures a vibrant urban scene at night. The setting is an outdoor cityscape, characterized by a kaleidoscope of neon lights in vivid colors such as red, purple, green, blue, and yellow. These lights illuminate the streets and buildings, creating a dynamic and colorful atmosphere. The architecture features modern structures with sleek lines and reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic feel. The streets below are bustling with movement, as vehicles navigate the illuminated roads, their headlights adding to the array of lights. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the urban landscape. Additionally, the video features white overlay bars at the top and bottom of the frame, framing the scene with a cinematic touch.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
