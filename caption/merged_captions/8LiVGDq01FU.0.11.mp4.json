  "merged_caption": "In this close-up shot, a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a loose bun is initially positioned in the center of the foreground, with her head and shoulders visible. She is wearing a brown jacket over a blue collared shirt and is looking towards the left side of the frame with a focused expression. The video is set inside a dimly lit room, emphasizing her profile and clothing details. In the background, a wall with a light switch is visible on the left, while indistinct elements occupy the right background. The camera starts at the woman's eye level, capturing her as she turns to the right and slightly shakes her head while maintaining her gaze in that direction. After a brief moment, she begins to rise from her seated position, causing her upper body to move upwards and partially out of the frame. As she stands, the camera shifts to her hip level, remaining fixed on her despite being slightly unsteady. The lower part of her brown jacket, which occupies the center and right portions of the frame in the foreground, comes into closer view, revealing a pocket detail and a small, square logo patch. The background remains dark and indistinct, focusing the viewer's attention on the woman's actions and the details of her jacket.",

    "Camera": "The video starts with the camera positioned at the woman's eye level. As the scene unfolds and the woman stands up, the camera shifts to her hip level. Despite being slightly unsteady, the camera remains fixed on her throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a loose bun. She is wearing a brown jacket over a blue shirt. Her expression appears focused as she looks to her right. The video captures her in a seated position initially, and then she begins to stand up, with the focus shifting to her jacket as she moves. The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing her profile and clothing details.",
    "Motion": "The woman, wearing a brown jacket over a blue shirt, is turned to the right, looking to her right. She then shakes her head slightly while maintaining her gaze in that direction. After a brief moment, she starts to rise from her seated position. The background is dark and indistinct, with minimal visible details, focusing the viewer's attention on the woman's actions.",
    "Scene": "The video is set inside a dimly lit room. A woman with brown hair tied back is visible, wearing a blue collared shirt beneath a brown canvas jacket. A wall with a light switch can be seen in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
