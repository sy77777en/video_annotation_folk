  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a level-angle shot focusing on an extremely muscular, light-skinned man's lower torso and arms. He has long, reddish-brown hair, a prominent jawline, and a smug expression with squinted eyes. His red-gloved fists are positioned at the top left and top right of the frame. The man is wearing a tight-fitting black short-sleeved shirt with white bands on the sleeves, black pants, and a pair of red boxing gloves on his hands. The scene is set indoors within a long, narrow aisle flanked by two towering, dark brown wooden bookshelves, densely packed with books that extend high towards the ceiling. Overhead, rectangular fluorescent lights are recessed into the ceiling, casting a bright, downward glow. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium shot that frames his upper body and head in the center, revealing his torso and smirking face as he stands prominently in the center of the aisle. The muscular man stands stationary as the camera transitions from a level-angle view of his legs to a low-angle view of his torso and face, revealing his moving mouth as he speaks. Tall bookshelves are visible on the left and right sides, while fluorescent lights are positioned at the top of the frame. This is a smooth tilt-up shot, starting from a level angle on a muscular man's gloved fists before transitioning to a low angle to reveal his torso and smirking face.",

He is wearing a tight-fitting black short-sleeved shirt with white bands on the sleeves, black pants, and a pair of red boxing gloves on his hands.

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a long, narrow aisle flanked by two towering, dark brown wooden bookshelves, densely packed with books that extend high towards the ceiling. Overhead, rectangular fluorescent lights are recessed into the ceiling, casting a bright, downward glow. The camera's perspective initially captures a level angle, looking directly at a muscular figure in red boxing gloves. It then tilts upwards to a low angle, effectively framing the individual's upper body as he stands prominently in the center of the aisle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
