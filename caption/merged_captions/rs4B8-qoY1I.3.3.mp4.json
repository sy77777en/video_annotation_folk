  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames the scene from an isometric perspective, presenting a retro arcade game with a distinct pixel-art aesthetic. The main subject, a small triangular aircraft with an orange body, yellow wings, and pink tail fins, starts in the bottom left and moves forward through a dark blue, maze-like area that occupies the center of the frame. The maze is bordered by a tall wall on the top left and a shorter wall on the bottom left, with various obstacles such as red-and-white striped barrels, gray pipe-like obstacles, and small dark craters scattered throughout. The floor is marked with a grid of lighter blue lines forming a labyrinthine path. The user interface elements are fixed around the gameplay area: scores are at the top left, an altitude meter labeled \"H\" and \"L\" is on the left, a fuel gauge is at the bottom center, and an enemy counter is in the bottom right. As the aircraft navigates the maze, it fires green projectiles that cause yellow and red starburst explosions on the ground. The aircraft then moves towards a long gray brick wall, firing at it until a section flashes and disappears, continuing to maneuver through the corridors and destroying gray ground-based targets. Bright yellow and red explosions erupt on the floor at times. The camera smoothly tracks the aircraft throughout the video, moving up and to the right as the plane navigates the level. The scene includes a heads-up display with several overlays, such as a \"TOP\" score and a \"1UP\" score at the top, \"FUEL\" gauge and aircraft icons on the bottom left, \"ENEMY PLANE = 00\" on the bottom right, and \"© SEGA 1982\" at the bottom center.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a retro arcade game with a distinct isometric, pixel-art aesthetic. The player's craft is a small, triangular aircraft with an orange body, yellow wings, and pink tail fins. The game's interface features a score displayed in a white pixelated font at the top, a horizontal orange bar representing a fuel gauge at the bottom center, and an enemy plane counter at the bottom right. On the left side of the play area, a vertical meter marked with \"H\" and \"L\" indicates altitude. Within the game world, red-and-white striped barrels and other abstract gray obstacles are positioned on a dark blue, maze-like floor, which is bordered by gray brick walls. Explosions are rendered as yellow and red starbursts, while the bullets fired by the aircraft are depicted as short green lines.",

    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a maze-like environment from a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set within a structure with light blue and gray walls, some of which have a brick texture. The floor is dark blue, marked with a grid of lighter blue lines that form a labyrinthine path. Scattered throughout the maze are red-and-white striped barrels, gray, pipe-like obstacles, and small, dark craters on the floor. A small, yellow and pink aircraft navigates the corridors, and at times, bright yellow and red explosions erupt on the floor. The scene includes a heads-up display with several overlays. At the top, a \"TOP\" score and a \"1UP\" score are displayed. On the bottom left, a \"FUEL\" gauge and aircraft icons are visible. The bottom right shows \"ENEMY PLANE = 00\", and the bottom center displays \"© SEGA 1982\". A vertical bar labeled \"H\" and \"L\" is on the left side of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
