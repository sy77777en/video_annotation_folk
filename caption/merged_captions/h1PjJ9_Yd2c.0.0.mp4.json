  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a young woman with fair skin and long, brown hair from behind, positioned in the center-right foreground. She is wearing a white and grey athletic jersey with red and blue accents. A polished gymnasium floor with white and yellow lines and small white cones extends from the foreground into the middle ground and background. The scene is set inside a gymnasium with plain, neutral-colored walls under bright, diffuse indoor lighting. The camera, initially positioned slightly above the subject, captures a high-angle view as the girl bends down, raising both hands to her head to tighten her ponytail. As she stands up, the camera tilts upward to a level angle, using a shallow depth of field with focus tracking to keep her head in focus. After the woman straightens her back, she turns towards her left. The view then transitions to a close-up of her face in profile, which remains in the center-right foreground. Her brown eyes and focused expression are highlighted as she looks toward the left side of the frame, with the gym floor out of focus in the background. The camera moves to her eye level by the end of the shot, maintaining focus on her face as she looks intently across the length of the court.",

    "Camera": "This is a shot from an extremely unsteady, eye-level camera. It begins with a high-angle view of a girl bending down. As she stands up, the camera tilts upward to a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field with focus tracking to keep the girl's head in focus.",
    "Subject": "A young woman with fair skin and long, brown hair is shown from behind, wearing a white and grey athletic jersey with red and blue accents. Her hair is already in a ponytail, and she uses both hands to tighten it. The view then shifts to a close-up of her face in profile, highlighting her brown eyes and focused expression as she looks to her left.",
    "Motion": "A young woman on a basketball court, seen from behind, raises both hands to her head to tighten her ponytail. The camera then transitions to a close-up profile view of her face as she straightens her back, turns her head towards her left, and looks.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a gymnasium with a polished, light-brown wooden floor marked with white and yellow lines. Several small, white cones are spaced out across the court's surface. The background consists of plain, neutral-colored walls under bright, diffuse indoor lighting. A young woman with long brown hair is briefly seen from behind before she turns towards her left in profile, looking intently across the length of the court.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
