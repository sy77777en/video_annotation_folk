  "merged_caption": "A medium shot captures a young, faceless person with short, black, curly hair and light gray skin, wearing a blue t-shirt and dark pants, positioned at the center-left foreground of a group of static, low-polygon human figures. These figures, rendered in a uniform gray, geometric style, are posed as if running in unison from left to right, with arms and legs mid-motion, but remain static. The individual running immediately to the right of the main subject is also captured in a medium shot. The more polygonal figures are positioned behind the main subject, with those directly behind visible from the knees up, while the full bodies of the crowd members further back are visible within the frame. The group appears posed as if running toward the bottom left of the frame. In the background, a misty, cliff-like structure with scattered vegetation is visible, suggesting a dawn setting. The camera, initially at eye level with a shallow depth of field focused on the person in the blue shirt, maintains a consistent side-on perspective of their collective stance. As the scene progresses, the camera smoothly cranes up while arcing slightly clockwise around the person, tilting downward as it transitions the view to a high angle, enhancing the impression of forward motion towards the bottom left of the frame. The ground is uneven and resembles a brown, earthy surface, while the massive, natural wall-like structure with patches of greenery is shrouded in fog, adding to the misty, blue-gray environment. The entire group, including both male and female forms, is depicted in the act of running forward together, with their clothing integrated into their angular forms, all facing the same direction.",

    "Camera": "At eye level, the camera maintains a shallow depth of field focused on the person in the blue shirt. The camera then smoothly cranes up while arcing slightly clockwise around the person, tilting downward as it transitions the view to a high angle.",
    "Subject": "A young, faceless person with short, black, curly hair and light gray skin is shown running in the foreground. This individual is wearing a short-sleeved blue t-shirt and dark pants. Surrounding and running alongside this person is a crowd of other human figures. These figures, which include both male and female forms, are all rendered in a uniform gray, low-polygon, geometric style, making them appear like statues. They are also faceless and lack any detailed features, with their clothing integrated into their angular forms. The entire group is depicted in the act of running forward together.",
    "Motion": "A group of stylized, low-polygon human figures is posed as if running in unison from left to right, but they remain static. A central figure, distinguished by a blue t-shirt and dark pants, is positioned in the foreground, surrounded by other gray, geometric figures. All individuals in the crowd are arranged to suggest a synchronized running gait, with arms and legs posed mid-motion. The camera maintains a consistent side-on perspective of their collective stance, giving the impression of forward motion towards the bottom left of the frame.",
    "Scene": "In a misty, blue-gray environment, a group of low-polygon figures is posed to look like they are running forward. The figures in the crowd are monochrome gray and semi-translucent, all facing the same direction. A single figure near the front is distinguished by a blue t-shirt and black pants. The ground is uneven and resembles a brown, earthy surface. In the background, a massive, natural wall-like structure with patches of greenery is shrouded in fog, and the lighting suggests a dawn setting.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot, relative to the main subject, captures a person in a blue shirt positioned at the center-left foreground of a group of static figures. The individual running immediately to the right of the main subject is also captured in a medium shot. The more polygonal figures are positioned behind the main subject, with those directly behind visible from the knees up, while the full bodies of the crowd members further back are visible within the frame. The group appears posed as if running toward the bottom left of the frame, but they remain static throughout the video. In the background, a misty, cliff-like structure with scattered vegetation is visible. As the scene progresses, the camera pulls back and moves upward to a higher angle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
