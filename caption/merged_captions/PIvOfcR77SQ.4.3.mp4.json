  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle shot of a snow-covered path in the center, which recedes from the foreground into the background. A snow-covered structure is on the left, and a large snowbank is on the right in the middle ground, with a forest of evergreen trees lining the background. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing this snowy landscape with a deep focus and large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera slightly rolls clockwise before transitioning to a high angle as it quickly tilts downward, revealing a person's hand gripping a black, circular steering wheel of a sled. The person's legs are visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners, and the front of the sled, featuring a metallic frame and a logo with a blue background and white text, is positioned in the bottom center, pointing down the snowy path that now fills the majority of the frame. The person, wearing a dark jacket, appears poised to move but remains stationary for the moment. The camera slightly tilts upward as the person turns the steering wheel, maintaining smooth movement with minimal shaking. The serene winter landscape is characterized by a snow-covered road flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a quiet and expansive environment. The ground is blanketed in thick snow, with visible tracks indicating recent movement, and the sky is overcast, contributing to the cold, wintry atmosphere. The road curves gently through the forested area, and the camera's first-person perspective emphasizes the person's readiness to navigate the snowy path.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, capturing a level angle view of a snowy landscape. The camera then slightly rolls clockwise before transitioning to a high angle as it quickly tilts downward to focus on a person’s hand steering a sled. It slightly tilts upward as the person turns the steering wheel. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is shot from a first-person point of view, showcasing a snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees lining the sides of a snow-covered path. The person is seen operating a sled with a steering wheel. The person is wearing a dark jacket, and their hand is visible on the black, circular steering wheel. The sled has a metallic frame and features a logo with a blue background and white text. Although the sled is stationary, the person appears to be preparing to move along the snowy path.",
    "Motion": "The video opens with a first-person view of a snow-covered path flanked by tall evergreen trees, with tire tracks etched into the snow. The camera tilts downward, offering a clearer perspective as it reveals the person's hand gripping the steering wheel of the sled. The person sits on the sled, which features a metallic frame and a logo on the right side, poised to move but remaining stationary for the moment.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting during the day. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a serene winter landscape. The ground is blanketed in thick snow, with visible tracks indicating recent movement. The sky is overcast, contributing to the cold, wintry atmosphere. As the camera tilts down, a hand is seen gripping the steering wheel of a stationary sled. The environment is quiet and expansive, with the road curving gently through the forested area.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle shot of a snow-covered path in the center, which recedes from the foreground into the background. A snow-covered structure is on the left, and a large snowbank is on the right in the middle ground, with a forest of evergreen trees lining the background. The camera then shifts to a high angle as it tilts downward. In this new framing, a person's hand holding a black steering wheel occupies the center foreground, suggesting a first-person perspective. The person's legs are visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners. The front of the sled is positioned in the bottom center, pointing down the snowy path that now fills the majority of the frame. The camera is positioned from the person's perspective, looking down at the sled and forward along the path."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
