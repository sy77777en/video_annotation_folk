  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man with light brown skin, a buzz cut, and a graying goatee is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He wears a cream-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with a zip-up front and black and white vertical patterns on the chest. The shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the blurred silhouette of another person visible in the left foreground. The scene is set within a dimly lit indoor establishment, likely a bar or diner at night, characterized by warm, muted lighting with prominent green and yellow hues, and a soft red light glowing in the top-center background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using an extremely shallow depth of field to focus on the man while blurring the foreground and background. The camera remains slightly unsteady and static throughout the clip. The man sits and speaks, moving his head slightly and raising his right hand to point his index finger upward as he talks. Throughout most of the video, he looks towards the blurred individual, gesturing with his right index finger. Towards the end of the video, he subtly lowers his head and turns it to his left. In the background, other indistinct figures are seated, including one in a multi-colored striped shirt. At the bottom of the frame, yellow overlay text reads: \"Wet your finger man. Don't drool on it just lick it man. Come on.\" The environment is softly blurred, enhancing the focus on the man in the midground.",

    "Subject": "A man with light brown skin, a buzz cut, and a graying goatee sits and speaks, appearing to converse with someone who is blurred on the left side of the frame. He is wearing a cream-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with a zip-up front and black and white vertical patterns on the chest.

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder point of view, the scene is set within a dimly lit indoor establishment, likely a bar or diner at night. The environment is characterized by warm, muted lighting with prominent green and yellow hues, and a soft red light glows in the background. A man wearing a cream-colored collared shirt with black geometric patterns sits at a red booth. The background is softly blurred, showing the indistinct figures of other patrons, including one in a multi-colored striped shirt. Yellow subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen, displaying the dialogue: \"Wet your finger man. Don't drool on it just lick it man. Come on.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
