  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot where a person's upper body, seen from the back with arms outstretched, is positioned in the middle-left bottom of the foreground, with their arms extending towards the left and right edges of the frame. The person wears a brightly colored, patterned shirt featuring hues of blue, red, and orange in a floral or abstract design, and a red and white patterned knit cap with a hint of blue. A white strap is visible over his left shoulder. The ground, a light yellow-brown grassland or wheat field, is visible at the bottom of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground, while blurred dark trees form the background across the top. The scene unfolds outdoors on a sunlit day, with a house and a visible blue sky partially seen behind the trees. The framing then transitions to a medium shot as the person, now positioned in the middle-right of the foreground, becomes smaller within the frame, consequently revealing more of the ground and the background vegetation. The person rotates slightly to his right while also shifting slightly to the right within the frame, making a slight jump and landing motion, contributing to the unstable and blurry visual. Throughout this transition, the camera maintains a position at the subject's level and rotates counterclockwise, causing the frame to tilt accordingly. The eye-level camera is at a level angle but also has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field, rolls counterclockwise, and zooms out, with unsteady movement and noticeable shaking. The overall visual quality is characterized by motion blur and a somewhat hazy appearance.",

    "Camera": "The eye-level camera is at a level angle but also has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera rolls counterclockwise and zooms out, with unsteady movement and noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "A person, seen from the back with arms outstretched, wears a brightly colored, patterned shirt featuring hues of blue, red, and orange in what appears to be a floral or abstract design. A white strap is visible over his left shoulder. On his head, he wears a red and white patterned knit cap that includes a hint of blue and a unique structure. From his outstretched arms, it is evident that he has dark skin.",
    "Motion": "The person, with arms outstretched, rotates slightly to his right while also shifting slightly to the right within the frame, making a slight jump and landing motion, which contributes to the unstable and blurry visual.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds outdoors on a sunlit day, featuring a field of autumnal golden-brown grass or wheat. Indistinct natural vegetation, possibly dark-colored trees, forms a blurred backdrop. A house and a visible blue sky can be partially seen behind the trees. A figure, dressed in a brightly patterned coat with blue, red, and orange hues and a red and white patterned head covering, is captured in dynamic motion with outstretched arms. A white strap is visible across the figure's left shoulder and left side of the torso. The overall visual quality is characterized by motion blur and a somewhat hazy appearance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
