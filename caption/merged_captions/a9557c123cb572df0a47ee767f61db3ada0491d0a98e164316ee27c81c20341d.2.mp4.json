  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot is framed from a central perspective looking down a dark, textured tunnel composed of multiple concentric rings with a diamond-plate surface. The rings fill the entire frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the middle ground, a bright white circle is positioned in the exact center of the frame, surrounded by a spiraled or rifled texture. Several metallic bolts with hexagonal heads are arranged in a circular pattern in the middle ground, with some extending into the foreground, pointing inward toward the surface of the rings. Some bolts are not fastened and appear to float, while others are already fastened to the structure. The camera cranes down through this tunnel-like structure, initially arcing slightly counter-clockwise and briefly zooming out midway through the movement. The surrounding bolts, whether floating or fixed, rotate continuously in a clockwise direction. The concentric rings remain stationary, while the central rifled core rotates initially in a counter-clockwise direction, pauses, and then switches to a clockwise rotation by the end of the video. The camera is positioned near the center of the structure, craning down and looking downward, capturing the slow, spiraling rotation of the innermost rifled core of the tunnel located in the middle ground, while the outer rings remain static. The scene provides a view of a dark, mechanical structure, with the rifled core shifting with an alternating motion, first spinning counterclockwise, pausing, and then spinning clockwise. The innermost part of the structure leads to a bright, white, circular smooth plane at the center of the rings, with most of the light gray, metallic bolts evenly distributed across the innermost two concentric rings.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, computer-generated shot where the camera cranes down. As it descends, it arcs slightly counter-clockwise and briefly zooms out midway through the movement.",
    "Subject": "A dark gray structure is composed of multiple concentric rings, each with a textured, diamond-plate surface. The innermost part of the structure has a different, spiraled or rifled texture, leading to a bright, white, circular smooth plane at the center of the rings. Most of the light gray, metallic bolts with hexagonal heads are evenly distributed across the innermost two concentric rings. Some bolts are not fastened and appear to float, while others are already fastened to the structure, positioned straight against the surface of the rings.",
    "Motion": "The camera cranes down through a dark, textured, tunnel-like structure. The surrounding bolts, whether floating or fixed, rotate continuously in a clockwise direction. The concentric rings remain stationary, while the central rifled core rotates initially in a counter-clockwise direction and then switches to a clockwise rotation by the end of the video.",
    "Scene": "The scene provides a view of a dark, mechanical structure composed of stable concentric rings. The rings are made of a dark gray material with a textured, diamond-plate surface. Some silver-colored bolts with hexagonal heads are embedded in the rings, while others appear to be floating in the air, pointing inward toward the surface of the rings. The center of the structure features a spiraling texture and culminates in a bright, white, circular plane. The rifled core of the structure shifts with an alternating motion, first spinning counterclockwise, pausing, and then spinning clockwise.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot is framed from a central perspective looking down a dark, textured tunnel. The tunnel's concentric rings fill the entire frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the middle ground, a bright white circle is positioned in the exact center of the frame. Several metallic bolts are arranged in a circular pattern in the middle ground, with some extending into the foreground, pointing inward toward the surface of the rings. The only movement is the slow, spiraling rotation of the innermost rifled core of the tunnel, located in the middle ground, while the outer rings remain static and the bolts rotate themselves clockwise. The camera is positioned near the center of the structure, craning down and looking downward."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
