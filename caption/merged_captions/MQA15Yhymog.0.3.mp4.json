  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A woman with light skin and long blonde hair, wearing a dark-colored bikini top and bright yellow bikini bottoms, stands on a yellow surfboard occupying the center foreground, viewed from behind, with the board extending from the bottom of the frame toward the middle. The camera is securely mounted on the yellow surfboard, providing a stable and immersive perspective as it moves through the ocean. The shot is captured from a fixed camera mounted above the water on a surfboard, following the woman from behind as she surfs. The camera moves forward with the board and is slightly unsteady, rolling with the water's motion, which creates a varying Dutch angle. The shot features mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping both the surfer and the background cityscape in clear view. To her left in the foreground, the nose of a white surfboard is visible. In the middle ground to the right, a man with light skin, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and black shorts, stands on his own blue and white surfboard. The camera, mounted on the woman's board, moves forward through the water, while the surfboard of the man on the right moves from the middle ground to the foreground and exits the frame on the right side after the man falls into the water, creating a splash. The scene unfolds on a sunny day under a blue sky with white clouds, with a city skyline of numerous high-rise buildings lining the coast of Waikiki in the background. The greenish-blue water features white foam and small waves as the board glides forward, and another person on a different surfboard is visible nearby.",

    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a woman with light skin and long blonde hair, viewed from behind. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini top and bright yellow bikini bottoms. She is standing on a yellow surfboard, with her arms held out to her sides for balance. In the middle ground, a man with light skin, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and black shorts, is also standing on a surfboard. The blue and white surfboard in the middle ground belongs to him, while a white surfboard is visible in the water to the left of the woman.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on POV, level-angle perspective on a surfboard, a woman stands and rides a wave toward a city shoreline, holding her arms out to her sides for balance. In the middle ground, a man also surfs in the same direction on a separate board but falls backward into the sea. As the woman glides forward, another surfboard passes by on the left, creating a splash.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
