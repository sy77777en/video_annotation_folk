  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level angle, presenting a breathtaking maritime scenery shot from the bow of a massive container ship on the open ocean at night. In the foreground, the tops of red and dark-colored shipping containers occupy the bottom third of the frame, leading from the bottom of the foreground toward the center of the middle ground. The dark ocean extends from the middle ground into the background, situated horizontally across the scene. In the background, the sky occupies the top two-thirds of the frame, with a band of dark clouds positioned just above the horizon and a vast, star-filled sky visible above the clouds, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way. A distant thunderstorm flashes intermittently, illuminating the cloud formations from within and casting a faint glow on the horizon. This is a stunning, greatly accelerated time-lapse video, captured from an elevated position between an aerial and overhead level. The camera maintains a level angle, creating an extremely wide shot with mild barrel distortion. It moves forward quickly, with some slight unsteadiness and shaking. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the container ship in the foreground to the starry sky, in sharp detail. The shot lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the awe-inspiring juxtaposition of the serene, star-filled cosmos and the dynamic, stormy weather over the vast, dark sea. The ship itself serves primarily as a vantage point, with the tops of its containers in the foreground guiding the viewer's gaze into the epic scene. A text and logo overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner, displaying a red YouTube logo next to the white text \"JEFFHK\".",

    "Motion": "This is a stunning time-lapse video capturing a dramatic night scene from the perspective of a large container ship at sea. The sky is filled with a brilliant display of the Milky Way and countless stars. Below the star-filled expanse, flashes of lightning illuminate clouds on the horizon, creating a powerful contrast over the dark ocean.",
    "Scene": "Aboard a container ship at night, the scene captures stacks of red and dark-colored shipping containers extending toward the open sea. Above, a vast, star-filled sky displays the Milky Way. Low on the horizon, dark clouds are intermittently illuminated from within by flashes of lightning. The sea is dark, with a few distant lights visible on the horizon. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a red YouTube logo next to the white text \"JEFFHK\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
