  "merged_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, a firearm with a holographic sight occupies the bottom half of the frame in the immediate foreground. Initially, a large hay bale is positioned in the center middle ground, with additional hay bales visible nearby. The background is filled with the silhouettes of pine trees across the top of the frame. The view slowly pans to the right, bringing more hay bales into view on the right and revealing more of the open space between them. Throughout the pan, the firearm remains fixed in its foreground position relative to the camera. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the scene, with a vertical bar on the left and ammunition information in the bottom right corner, both remaining static within the frame. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The view pans slightly to the right, and the firearm is raised at the beginning of the scene, moving closer to align the holographic sight with the eye. The view then holds steady. The scene is set in a nighttime rural, wooded area, viewed through a green night vision filter. The digital heads-up display features a white crosshair in the center, a vertical bar with changing numbers on the left, and ammunition counters and icons in the bottom right corner, indicating an ammunition count of 13 in the magazine and 90 in reserve. The person is positioned near a large, cylindrical hay bale in a dark, outdoor setting. In the background, additional hay bales and the silhouettes of several pine trees are visible. The camera intermittently pans to the right and slightly moves to the left, zooming in to aim at enemies.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, eye-level first-person perspective, the camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera intermittently pans to the right and slightly moves to the left, zooming in to aim at enemies.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision display, a person wearing white gloves holds a dark-colored firearm. The weapon is equipped with a large, boxy holographic sight on its top rail. A digital heads-up display is superimposed on the view, indicating an ammunition count of 13 in the magazine and 90 in reserve. The person is positioned near a large, cylindrical hay bale in a dark, outdoor setting. In the background, additional hay bales and the silhouettes of several pine trees are visible.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the view pans slightly to the right. The firearm is raised at the beginning of the scene and moves closer to align the holographic sight with the eye. The view then holds steady.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a nighttime scene in a rural, wooded area, viewed through a green night vision filter. In the foreground, a rifle with a holographic sight is held by gloved hands. The view pans slowly across a field containing large, cylindrical hay bales, with a dark forest of tall pine trees visible in the background. The scene is augmented with a digital heads-up display overlay, featuring a white crosshair in the center, a vertical bar with changing numbers on the left, and ammunition counters and icons in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
