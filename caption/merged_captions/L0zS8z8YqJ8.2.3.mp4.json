  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a photograph, which is centered in the frame and rests on a wooden table in the foreground, viewed from a high angle. This eye-level shot begins with a high-angle view focused on a picture on a table. The camera then executes a smooth, continuous backward and upward movement, tilting up to transition from the high-angle close-up to a level-angle wide shot of the entire train compartment. As the camera pulls back and tilts upward, the photograph is revealed to be inside a similar train compartment. The camera then moves back and tilts upwards, showing a stationary, silver humanoid figure sitting on a sofa and looking out the window at the passing scenery. In this final composition, a metallic figure sits on a sofa in the left middle ground. The table with the photograph is located in the center middle ground, positioned between the sofa and an armchair on the right. A large window occupies the center background, with a door visible on the far right. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire room sharp throughout the movement. The compartment features a brown sofa and a matching armchair, with the wooden table positioned between them. The walls are paneled with dark wood, and a large window offers a view of a green, tree-filled landscape passing by. Initially, the overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text: \"[2]; Joosthaler, Anton, (1981) - Die Breitspurbahn Hitlers.\" This text transitions to just \"[2]\" and finally changes to \"[2]; duckSPLASH (CC-BY 4.0)\" at the end. The camera's final position is at the subject's level, establishing a clear sense of depth from the foreground furniture to the background landscape seen through the window.",

    "Subject": "The video opens on a rectangular color photograph with a white border, which depicts the interior of a luxurious, wood-paneled train car. The photograph rests on a wooden table inside a similar train compartment. In the wider view, a silver, metallic humanoid figure sits on a brown upholstered sofa on the left side of the compartment. The figure, which has the build of a slender man, is posed looking out a large window, with its palms facing each other and resting on its thighs. Across from the sofa is a matching brown armchair.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a full shot of a photograph on a table and slowly pulls back. This movement reveals that the table is inside a train compartment. The camera then moves back and tilts upwards, showing a stationary, silver humanoid figure sitting on a sofa and looking out the window at the passing scenery.",
    "Scene": "The video opens with a full shot of a photograph illustrating a vintage train car interior, placed on a wooden table. As the camera pulls back and tilts upward, the photograph is revealed to be inside a similar train compartment. The compartment features a brown sofa and a matching armchair, with the wooden table positioned between them. A metallic, chrome-like figure of a person sits on the sofa. The walls are paneled with dark wood, and a large window offers a view of a green, tree-filled landscape passing by. Initially, the overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text: \"[2]; Joosthaler, Anton, (1981) - Die Breitspurbahn Hitlers.\" This text transitions to just \"[2]\" and finally changes to \"[2]; duckSPLASH (CC-BY 4.0)\" at the end.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
