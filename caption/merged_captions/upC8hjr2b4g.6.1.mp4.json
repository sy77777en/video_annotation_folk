  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a male figure slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground against a completely black background. The figure, seemingly a 3D render, has short, dark, neatly styled hair and a featureless, smooth, light-skinned face. He wears gold-rimmed, round glasses and a black earbud in one ear, dressed in a light-colored, button-up shirt, a black belt with a silver buckle, dark blue trousers, and a light-colored, open overshirt or lab coat. The man is standing, facing slightly to his right (viewer's left), with his head slightly tilted down. The scene is illuminated from the front, creating a soft glow around his form, particularly on the white overshirt, while the rest of the scene remains in darkness. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle. Initially, the scene appears in deep focus, but as the camera moves forward and upward, it transitions to a shallow depth of field, with only the glasses on the humanoid subject's face remaining clear while the rest of the subject's body becomes slightly blurry. The camera movement is generally smooth, though there are minor instances of unsteadiness and shakiness during the movement. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up, maintaining the figure's position slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. Throughout the video, the camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the subtle glow around his form against the black void.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a static, objective POV shot of a faceless male figure positioned against a completely black background. The figure, seemingly a 3D render, has black, neatly styled hair and wears gold-rimmed glasses and small, light-colored earbuds. He is dressed in a light green, button-up shirt, a black belt with a silver buckle, and a white, open overshirt or light jacket. The figure is illuminated from the front, creating a soft glow around its silhouette, particularly on the white overshirt, while the rest of the scene remains in darkness. There are no discernible environmental details or setting beyond the figure and the black void.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a male figure slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. The background is entirely black. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up, maintaining the figure's position slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. Throughout the video, the camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
