  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where a girl's right arm is in the right foreground, moving upward to lift the chrome faucet handle located in the left foreground of the middle ground, activating the water flow into the white sink. She is wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt, with a black wristband and a hair tie coil on her right wrist, while her left arm is without accessories. Beneath the dark clothing on her left shoulder, a pink camisole-like garment is visible. After turning on the faucet, both of her hands are placed under the running water as she begins to wash her hands, extending her left hand forward while moving her right hand downward to start rubbing her hands together. The camera, positioned at eye level, initially uses a high angle, then tilts upward and slightly pans left to a level angle, showcasing her reflection in the mirror. Her reflection, a chest-up shot, occupies the center-left middle ground of the mirror, revealing her with light skin and dark hair tied back, her head slightly bowed and focused on the task. Her actual side of her head is visible in the far right foreground. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, and the movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Through the mirror, a window with horizontal blinds is visible in the background, with faintly visible trees and houses in a residential area. The scene takes place indoors in a modern bathroom with a minimalist design, softly lit by natural light filtering through the window. A toothbrush holder containing various colorful toothbrushes is visible in the center of the middle ground, to the right of the faucet, with a tube of toothpaste to its left and slightly behind it, enhancing the clean and simple aesthetic.",

    "Subject": "The video features a girl washing her hands in front of a mirror. Initially, only her arms and a small part of her body are visible as she turns on the faucet. She is wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt, and a black wristband along with a hair tie coil are noticeable on her right wrist, while her left arm does not have any accessories. Beneath the dark clothing on her left shoulder, a pink camisole-like garment is visible. As the camera tilts upward, her reflection in the mirror reveals her chest-up view, showing her with light skin and dark hair tied back. Her head is partially visible on the far right of the frame, and she appears focused on the task at hand.",
    "Motion": "A person uses her right hand to lift the chrome faucet handle upward, activating the water flow into the white sink. She then extends her left hand forward while moving her right hand downward to start rubbing her hands together for washing. The camera gradually moves upward, revealing her reflection in the mirror. She is seen washing her hands, with her head slightly bowed and focused on the task.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors in a modern bathroom with a minimalist design. The environment is softly lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through a window with horizontal blinds. Faintly visible through the blinds are trees and houses in a residential area. The bathroom features a sleek, white countertop with a chrome faucet and a white sink. To the right of the faucet, a cup holds colorful toothbrushes, adding a touch of color to the otherwise neutral setting, and a tube of toothpaste is located behind and to the left of the cup. The walls are light-colored, enhancing the clean and simple aesthetic. A woman is leaning over the sink and mirror, washing her hands. As the camera tilts upward, her upper body, from the chest up, becomes clearly visible in the mirror, contributing to the calm and everyday atmosphere of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where the girl's right arm is in the right foreground, moving upward to turn on a chrome faucet located in the left foreground of the middle ground. After turning on the faucet, both of her hands are placed under the running water as she begins to wash her hands. The camera then tilts upward and pans left, transitioning the view. In the final framing, the girl's reflection, a chest-up shot, occupies the center-left middle ground of the mirror. The actual side of her head is visible in the far right foreground. Through the mirror, a window with horizontal blinds is visible in the background. A toothbrush holder containing various toothbrushes is visible in the center of the middle ground, to the right of the faucet, with a tube of toothpaste to its left and slightly behind it. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
