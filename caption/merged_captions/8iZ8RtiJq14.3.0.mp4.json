  "merged_caption": "The video features a smooth, eye-level medium close-up shot that arcs clockwise around a stylized, light gray humanoid figure in distress, depicted seated at a table with its head lowered and back hunched over. The figure, wearing a light blue, long-sleeved collared shirt with cuffs and cufflinks, clutches its head with both hands, which flicker with a faint blue energy effect on its fingertips. Initially positioned on the left side of the frame, the figure gradually moves toward the center as the camera shifts. Thick stacks of white papers, rendered with a strong horizontal motion blur suggesting rapid movement, occupy the foreground, starting from the center and right side of the frame, and later appear on both sides of the figure, resting on tables. The paper remains in the foreground while the figure stays in the midground, maintaining focus on the figure and the surrounding elements. The scene is set in a dimly lit, animated environment with a dark reddish-brown background, and the camera remains at the subject's level throughout the scene. To the right of the figure, a massive stack of papers is depicted with a strong horizontal motion blur, suggesting a rapid accumulation or movement that extends off-screen. The figure's hands appear to have a faint blue glow. In the lower left corner, there is white overlay text \"[4,5]\".",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot that arcs clockwise around a stylized figure in distress. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the figure in the midground.",
    "Subject": "A stylized, light gray humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless face is depicted seated at a table, head lowered and back hunched over. The figure wears a light blue, long-sleeved collared shirt with cuffs and cufflinks, and it clutches its head with both hands. Next to the figure is a tall stack of white papers that is blurred with a horizontal motion effect.",
    "Motion": "A stylized humanoid figure remains seated in a hunched position, clutching its head as a faint blue energy effect flickers on its fingertips. To the right, a tall stack of papers is rendered with a strong horizontal motion blur, creating the appearance of papers rapidly moving past.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit, animated scene with a dark reddish-brown background, a light-blue, featureless humanoid figure in a suit is hunched over on the left, holding its head in its hands. To the right of the figure, a massive stack of papers is depicted with a strong horizontal motion blur, suggesting a rapid accumulation or movement that extends off-screen. The figure's hands appear to have a faint blue glow. In the lower left corner, there is white overlay text \"[4,5]\".",
    "Spatial": "The video features a smooth, eye-level medium close-up shot that arcs clockwise around a stylized humanoid figure in distress. Initially positioned on the left side of the frame, the figure gradually moves toward the center as the camera shifts. Thick stacks of bare paper occupy the foreground, starting from the center and right side of the frame, and later appear on both sides of the figure, resting on tables. The paper remains in the foreground while the figure stays in the midground, maintaining focus on the figure and the surrounding elements. A dark reddish-brown wall is visible in the background, and the camera remains at the subject's level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
