  "merged_caption": "A high-angle shot captures the draped fabric of a light beige trench coat made of a twill fabric with a distinct diagonal weave, arranged in soft folds that fill most of the frame. The off-white material features a fine twill weave, and the background wall is visible in the top left corner. Six large, round, black buttons, each with four holes in the center arranged in a cross shape and featuring text engraved around its rim, are visible, arranged in two parallel lines of three, spaced apart, extending from the bottom left of the foreground to the top right of the frame into the middle ground. The middle left button and the top right button are barely visible behind the fabric folds. The scene is evenly lit with soft, diffused light, which creates gentle shadows within the creases of the garment. Shot from a high angle, the camera smoothly moves backward, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the buttons and fabric of the trench coat in the midground in sharp focus, while the trench coat itself remains stationary.",

    "Subject": "A close-up view reveals a light beige trench coat made of a twill fabric with a distinct diagonal weave. The garment is draped in soft folds, and several large, round, black buttons are sewn onto its surface.

    "Scene": "A close-up, high-angle shot captures the draped fabric of a light-colored garment in an indoor setting with a plain, light gray background. The off-white material, featuring a fine twill weave, is arranged in soft folds and undulations. Scattered across the fabric are several large, circular black buttons, each with four-hole stitching in a cross pattern. The scene is evenly lit with soft, diffused light, which creates gentle shadows within the creases of the garment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
