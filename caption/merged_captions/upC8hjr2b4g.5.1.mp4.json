  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames a low-polygon figure, illuminated in red, in the foreground, positioned slightly left of center, seated at a desk and appearing to type on a computer. The computer monitor with a curved stand takes up approximately two-fifths of the left side of the frame. In the middle ground to the right, a second low-polygon figure stands with arms crossed, and further to the right, a third partially obscured low-polygon figure is visible. All subjects remain static throughout the shot, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The camera is positioned at hip level, using a level angle. It utilizes a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movement, simultaneously moving forward, upward, and tilting downward. The video features three stylized, low-polygon human figures in a dimly lit setting. In the foreground, a figure with a form and short, wreath-like hairstyle suggestive of a female is seated at a desk, appearing to type on a computer. This figure is rendered in a light gray, angular style, but its head and torso are strongly illuminated by a red light, giving them a distinct red appearance, while its arms and hands also show a red tint. In the background, to the right, stand two other figures. The figure closer to the center, with a build and attire resembling a formal suit, stands with arms crossed and appears to be male. The figure further to the right is partially obscured, has a hand on their hip, and is wearing a scarf, suggesting they are female. Both background figures are a uniform light gray or white, with subtle blueish ambient lighting, and are rendered in a low-polygon, angular style. All three figures have featureless, angular faces.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts a dimly lit indoor scene featuring three low-poly, stylized human figures. In the foreground, a figure with short, stylized hair is seated at a dark desk, with both hands on the keyboard of a computer monitor that has a curved stand, suggesting they are typing. This central figure is rendered in a desaturated tone but is prominently illuminated by a red glow emitted from the monitor, highlighting its torso and faceless head. In the middle ground, two other figures stand; they are rendered in a pale, almost white, desaturated color. One of these figures has its arms crossed, and both appear to be observing the person at the computer. The overall environment is dark and minimalist, with the red light on the foreground figure being the most striking visual element.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
