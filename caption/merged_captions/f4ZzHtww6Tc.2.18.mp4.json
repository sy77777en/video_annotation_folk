  "merged_caption": "A man on a skateboard is captured in a full shot from a rear-facing perspective, initially positioned in the central-right area of the foreground. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark blue jeans that are cuffed at the bottom, revealing white socks and dark-colored skate shoes. Tattoos are visible on both of his arms. A large glass building occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while trees and other buildings are visible in the background. The ground is paved with large, gray, textured stone tiles. The camera, shot with a noticeable fisheye lens causing straight lines to curve outward, follows the skateboarder from behind, moving forward continuously and panning to match his turns. The camera angle is generally level but features a varying Dutch angle due to camera roll, with deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp. The video follows the man as he pushes off on his skateboard and rides along a sidewalk next to the glass-walled building. He then steers into a narrow, covered passageway between buildings, making a turn before skating out of the tunnel. As he enters the breezeway, a textured stone wall appears on the right, and the path leads from an open area, past a dark circular planter, into the breezeway flanked by the glass wall on one side and a textured gray stone wall on the other, into which an orange and black ATM is recessed. The man then turns the skateboard to the right, causing the camera to turn with him. The shot transitions from a rear view to a side view, with the man now positioned in the center of the frame, crouching over the board. The background on the left now shows the view out of the breezeway toward trees and another building. The video concludes with a side view of the man's face, which is captured by the camera.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot with a noticeable fisheye lens, which causes straight lines to curve outward. Filmed from a shaky, ground-level perspective, the camera follows the skateboarder from behind, moving forward continuously and panning to match their turns. The camera angle is generally level but features a varying Dutch angle due to camera roll. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man is shown from a low, rear-facing perspective as he skateboards. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark blue jeans that are cuffed at the bottom, revealing white socks and dark-colored skate shoes. Tattoos are visible on both of his arms. The video concludes with a side view of the man's face, which is captured by the camera.",
    "Motion": "A man pushes off on a skateboard and rides along a sidewalk next to a glass-walled building. He then steers into a narrow, covered passageway between buildings, making a turn before skating out of the tunnel. After exiting, he slowly crouches down on his skateboard.",
    "Scene": "Shot from a level, wide-angle perspective, the video follows a skateboarder through a modern urban plaza during the day. The ground is paved with large, gray, textured stone tiles. On the left, a building features a large glass wall that appears curved due to the fisheye lens effect, reflecting trees and other city buildings. The path leads from an open area, past a dark circular planter, into a narrower, covered breezeway. This passage is flanked by the glass wall on one side and a textured gray stone wall on the other, into which an orange and black ATM is recessed. Through the end of the breezeway, more trees and buildings are visible in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
