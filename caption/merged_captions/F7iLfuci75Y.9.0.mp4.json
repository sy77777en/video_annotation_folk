  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, four humanoid figures with a metallic appearance are positioned at desks in a dimly lit room. In the right middle ground, one figure is seen from the back, with another figure to its left in the center middle ground. A third figure is located in the left background, while a fourth figure and its computer partially occupy the left background, opposite the third figure. Each figure, uniformly dressed in dark clothing, sits in front of a computer monitor, which is the main source of light, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. The monitors display a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, executing a very smooth, combined movement, simultaneously moving forward and pedestaling upward while tilting down, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the figures at their computers in the midground in focus. The four humanoid figures remain completely still, seated at their desks and facing their computer monitors throughout the video. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the figures at their computers in the midground in focus. The camera executes a very smooth, combined movement, simultaneously moving forward and pedestaling upward while tilting down.",
    "Subject": "The video features four humanoid figures seated at desks, each facing a computer screen. These figures have a metallic appearance, suggesting they might be robots or mannequins. They are positioned in a dimly lit room, with two figures visible in the middleground and two in the background. Each figure is oriented towards their respective screen, with their heads slightly tilted as if focused on the monitors. The figures are uniformly dressed in dark clothing, and their metallic heads reflect the light from the screens, creating a consistent visual theme throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The four humanoid figures remain completely still, seated at their desks and facing their computer monitors throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, four figures with a reflective, metallic quality are present. Two of them are seated in a row at black desks in the center and right middle ground, while the other two are positioned opposite each other in the left background. Dressed in black, they sit in matching office chairs, each facing a computer. The monitors are the primary light source, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. Each screen displays a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, four humanoid figures are positioned at desks in a dimly lit room. In the right middle ground, one figure is seen from the back, with another figure to its left in the center middle ground. A third figure is located in the left background, while a fourth figure and its computer partially occupy the left background, opposite the third figure. Each figure sits in front of a computer monitor, which is the main source of light. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
