  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young man with curly dark hair, positioned in the right foreground of the frame against a dark, indistinct background. The camera is held at his eye level and is slightly tilted, creating a fixed Dutch angle with a tilted horizon. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground, and smoothly zooms in, maintaining minimal shaking throughout, with no changes in shot size and subject placement. The young man maintains a focused expression with wide-open eyes, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting changes from a warm tone to a pronounced red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. The subject exhibits slight head movement and rapid breathing, adding subtle dynamism to the scene. The dimly lit environment and subdued lighting create a moody atmosphere, with the transition in lighting suggesting a change in mood or situation. The background remains indistinct, emphasizing the subject's expression and the shift in lighting. The overall scene is intimate and focused, with minimal distractions from the surroundings.",

    "Motion": "The video features a young man with curly dark hair in close-up. He maintains a focused expression with wide-open eyes, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting intensifies to a pronounced red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. The camera appears to be tilted, adding to the intensity of his gaze. The subject exhibits slight head movement and rapid breathing, adding subtle dynamism to the scene.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors, featuring a dimly lit environment with a focus on a single subject. The setting is characterized by subdued lighting that casts shadows, creating a moody atmosphere. The transition in lighting from a warm tone to a red hue suggests a change in mood or situation.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
