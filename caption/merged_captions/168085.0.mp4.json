  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot presenting a dynamic, extreme wide shot of a large, flat-topped mountain from a high-angle, aerial perspective. The mountain, known as a tepui, is the primary element, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. Its summit is covered in vibrant green vegetation and split by a central crevice, from which a slender white waterfall emerges, cascading down the immense, sheer cliff face into a dark canyon located in the center-bottom of the frame. A small river is visible at the very bottom-center, winding through the foreground forest. The central mountain is flanked by lush green slopes on the left and right sides in the middle ground. In the background, layers of distant mountains extend across the top of the frame, beneath a hazy sky. The camera, from a high, aerial angle, slowly and smoothly pedestals down toward the massive waterfall, enhancing the view of the surrounding mountains stretching into the hazy distance. A deep focus keeps the entire breathtaking landscape, from the verdant plateau to the distant mountains, sharp and clear. The tepui is situated within a vast, mountainous landscape covered in dense green forest, with distant mountain ranges fading into a light haze under a partly cloudy sky. The shot's purpose is to convey the awe-inspiring atmosphere of the location, with the unique geological formation and waterfall serving as the central elements of the composition. The camera gradually descends throughout the video, adding a sense of movement to the composition, and the river can be seen emerging from the base of the falls and winding through the jungle.",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera slowly and smoothly pedestals down toward the massive waterfall cascading from a flat-topped mountain. A deep focus keeps the entire breathtaking landscape, from the verdant plateau to the distant mountains, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a breathtaking aerial view of a massive, flat-topped mountain, known as a tepui. Its surface is covered in vibrant green vegetation and is uniquely split by a central crevice from which a spectacular waterfall plunges into the deep, shadowed canyon below, with the surrounding vista filled with rolling green mountains fading into a hazy horizon. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immense scale and majestic beauty of the natural environment itself. The shot's purpose is to convey the awe-inspiring atmosphere of the location, with the unique geological formation and waterfall serving as the central elements of the composition.",
    "Motion": "This video features a breathtaking photograph of what appears to be Angel Falls in Venezuela. The image captures an aerial view of the waterfall cascading from the top of a massive, flat-topped mountain known as a tepui. The summit of the tepui is covered in vibrant green vegetation and is split by a deep canyon from which the waterfall emerges. The water visibly plummets in a long, slender stream down the immense, sheer cliff face into the dense, verdant rainforest that blankets the valley below. The camera moves downward, enhancing the view of the surrounding mountains stretching into the hazy distance.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of what appears to be Angel Falls in Venezuela during the daytime. The scene is dominated by a massive, flat-topped mountain, or tepui, whose summit is covered in vibrant green vegetation and split by a central crevice. From this crevice, a slender white waterfall plunges down the sheer, layered rock face of the cliff into a dark canyon below. The tepui is situated within a vast, mountainous landscape covered in dense green forest, with distant mountain ranges fading into a light haze under a partly cloudy sky. A river can be seen emerging from the base of the falls and winding through the jungle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
