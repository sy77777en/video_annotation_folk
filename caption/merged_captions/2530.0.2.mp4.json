  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the ballet dancer's feet, clad in well-worn, light-colored pointe shoes, occupying the central area of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Initially, one foot is slightly ahead of the other, with one foot positioned en pointe and the other half-toed on the ground. As the sequence progresses, both feet transition to en pointe, showcasing the dancer's balance and precision. The dancer then continuously shifts positions, tapping the toes on the ground. The dancer's feet remain the primary focus throughout, with no significant change in their 2D position within the frame. The background is minimalistic and light-colored, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps attention on the feet. The camera captures the ballet shoes at ground level, positioned at a level angle, and employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the ballet shoes in the foreground. It exhibits minor, unsteady movements with noticeable shaking. The dancer has a tanned or darker skin tone, visible through the openings of the shoes, and the crossed ribbons are tied securely around the ankles. The bright, even lighting and soft shadows suggest it could be midday, but the setting remains ambiguous, leaving it unclear whether the scene is indoors or outdoors. The shoes show signs of wear, with visible scuffs and frayed edges, highlighting their fabric material. The focus is on the technical skill and elegance of the dancer's footwork, with the securely tied crossed ribbons around the ankles emphasizing the technical skill and elegance of the dancer's footwork.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a ballet dancer's feet, where one foot is positioned en pointe and the other is half-toed on the ground. As the video progresses, both feet transition to en pointe, showcasing the dancer's balance and precision. The dancer then continuously shifts positions, tapping the toes on the ground.

    "Scene": "The video captures a dancer's feet in worn, beige pointe shoes, performing on a smooth, light-colored surface that resembles a stage or dance floor. The bright, even lighting and soft shadows suggest it could be midday, but the setting remains ambiguous, leaving it unclear whether the scene is indoors or outdoors. The shoes show signs of wear, with visible scuffs and frayed edges, highlighting their fabric material. The minimalist background emphasizes the dancer's movements and the texture of the shoes.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the ballet dancer's feet. The feet, clad in well-worn pointe shoes, occupy the central area of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Initially, one foot is slightly ahead of the other, both en pointe. As the sequence progresses, the feet shift subtly, maintaining their central placement while adjusting their stance. The dancer's feet remain the primary focus throughout, with no significant change in their 2D position within the frame. The background is minimalistic and light-colored, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps attention on the feet. The camera is at the subject's level, capturing the detailed movements and positioning of the feet without any noticeable elevation changes."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
