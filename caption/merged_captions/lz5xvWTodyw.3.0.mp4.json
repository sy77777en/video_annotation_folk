  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a level angle, third-person perspective, positioned just behind and above a green train navigating through an urban environment. The train occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, moving forward along an elevated highway that extends from the bottom of the frame into the distant background, creating a sense of depth. The video captures an urban setting on a cloudy day, showcasing a highway elevated above a cityscape. Modern buildings with illuminated windows line the road, highlighting an active city environment. The highway is bordered by streetlights, with a park featuring sparse trees adjacent to it. A body of water is visible to the right of the highway. Buildings are positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a body of water and distant city elements are visible in the background on the right. Several static overlays frame the scene: \"Pier 59\" is in the top right corner, a mini-map is in the bottom left, a \"JUMP\" meter is in the bottom right, and a \"Passengers\" bar is at the bottom center. A large white arrow is located in the upper center, pointing down toward the road ahead. As the camera moves forward with the vehicle, the surrounding scenery flows, moving toward the camera. The camera smoothly follows the perspective of a forward-moving train, initially moving straight ahead. As the train moves forward, it approaches a yellow rectangular box on the road. Upon reaching the box, the train makes an abrupt right turn, driving off the edge of the multi-lane road and falling. As the train changes direction, the camera pans to the right, maintaining steadiness throughout. Overlays include a white arrow in the upper center of the screen, changing direction with the green train's movement.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at an overhead level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera smoothly follows the perspective of a forward-moving train, initially moving straight ahead. As the train changes direction, the camera pans to the right, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a cityscape from a third-person video game perspective, where the viewer seems to control a green train navigating through the urban environment. Approximately one and a half cars of the green train are visible, adding a dynamic and interactive element to the scene, which highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city, including its buildings, roads, and surrounding areas.",
    "Motion": "A green train is traveling on a multi-lane road in an urban area with tall buildings and streetlights, viewed from a third-person perspective. As the train moves forward, it approaches a yellow rectangular box on the road. Upon reaching the box, the train makes an abrupt right turn, driving off the edge of the multi-lane road and falling.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an urban setting on a cloudy day, showcasing a highway elevated above a cityscape. Modern buildings with illuminated windows line the road, highlighting an active city environment. The highway is bordered by streetlights, with a park featuring sparse trees adjacent to it. A body of water is visible to the right of the highway. The road is smooth and wide, accommodating a large, green vehicle in motion, emphasizing the scene's dynamic nature. Overlays include a white arrow in the upper center of the screen, changing direction with the green train's movement. The top and bottom corners display text, with \"Pier 59\" in the upper right corner. The lower right corner shows game information with \"JUMP 100%,\" while the lower left corner features a game mini-map. The bottom overlay displays changing numbers with \"Passengers\" and a green and gray status bar.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
