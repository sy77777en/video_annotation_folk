  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a male-presenting humanoid figure seated in the center of the frame and in the foreground. This figure has a featureless, metallic silver head with a red glow on its sides and is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt, a dark grey tie, and dark blue trousers. Its metallic silver hands rest on its lap as it sits motionless in a black chair, looking forward. To his left and right are other black chairs, also in the foreground, set against a two-toned wall in the background, with a solid black upper section and a lower section made of light gray, rectangular panels. From a hip-level perspective, the camera smoothly trucks left with a slight upward tilt followed by a downward tilt, shifting the first figure out of the frame to the right. This movement reveals a female-presenting humanoid figure sitting completely still in a similar chair, now centered in the frame in a medium shot. She also has a featureless, metallic silver head, which has a blue glow on its sides and hair styled in a bun. She is dressed in a light grey pantsuit with a white shirt underneath, sits with her legs crossed, and her metallic silver hands rest on her lap. An empty chair is visible to her left, which is the right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the entire sequence, and despite minimal unsteadiness, a deep focus keeps both figures and the background relatively sharp. The scene takes place in a modern, minimalist room featuring a row of black, contemporary chairs, with focused lighting casting a red glow on one figure's head and a blue glow on the other as the camera trucks slowly from right to left.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level perspective, the camera smoothly trucks left with a slight upward tilt followed by a downward tilt. This movement shifts the frame's focus from a seated male figure to a seated female figure. Despite minimal unsteadiness, a deep focus keeps both figures and the background relatively sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video begins focused on a male-presenting humanoid figure with a featureless, metallic silver head that has a red glow on its sides. The figure is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt, a dark grey tie, and dark blue trousers, and its metallic silver hands are resting on its lap as it sits in a black chair. The camera then trucks to the left to reveal a female-presenting humanoid figure sitting in a similar chair. This figure also has a featureless, metallic silver head, which has a blue glow on its sides and hair styled in a bun. She is dressed in a light grey pantsuit with a white shirt underneath, and she sits with her legs crossed and her metallic silver hands on her lap.",
    "Motion": "A male-presenting humanoid figure sits motionless in a black chair, hands resting on its lap, looking forward. The camera then trucks to the left, revealing a female-presenting humanoid figure who is also sitting completely still in a similar chair, with her legs crossed, metallic silver hands on her lap, and her head turned to her left. Neither figure exhibits any movement throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a modern, minimalist room featuring a row of black, contemporary chairs. The chairs are set against a two-toned wall, with a solid black upper section and a lower section made of light gray, rectangular panels. Two humanoid figures with smooth, reflective metallic heads and hands are seated in the chairs. One figure wears a light blue shirt and a dark tie, while the other is dressed in a light gray suit. The focused lighting casts a red glow on one figure's head and a blue glow on the other as the camera trucks slowly from right to left.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a male-presenting humanoid figure seated in the center of the frame and in the foreground. To his left and right are other black chairs, also in the foreground, set against a two-toned wall in the background. The camera then trucks horizontally to the left, shifting the first figure out of the frame to the right. The shot settles on a female-presenting humanoid figure, now centered in the frame in a medium shot. She is also positioned in the foreground, with an empty chair visible to her left, which is the right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the entire sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
