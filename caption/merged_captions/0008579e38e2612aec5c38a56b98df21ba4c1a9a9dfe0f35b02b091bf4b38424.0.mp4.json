  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of three women positioned in the foreground: one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right, all standing before a background wall illuminated by vibrant pink and purple light in an indoor studio setting. The woman on the left has dark hair and wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, a large earring, and black heeled sandals, with a black prosthetic left leg featuring intricate patterns. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, smiles while wearing a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals. The woman on the right has long, light brown hair and wears a pink, short-sleeved, pleated dress with pink heeled sandals. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, captures the women gently swaying their bodies with smiles on their faces, as if engaged in conversation and laughter under pink and blue lighting. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle view that focuses on their legs and feet, revealing that the woman on the left has a prosthetic leg. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. In the final composition, their legs are positioned around a vertical, glowing light tube that stands on the floor in the center of the frame, with the prosthetic leg of the woman from the left now prominently visible on the bottom left. The reflective floor enhances the visual impact of the scene, with the camera movement emphasizing the unique details of the prosthetic leg and the overall dynamic of the women's interaction.",

    "Subject": "Three women stand close together under pink and blue lighting. The woman on the left has dark hair and wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, a large earring, and black heeled sandals. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, smiles while wearing a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals.

The woman on the left has a black prosthetic left leg with intricate patterns on it.",
    "Motion": "Three women stand close together, gently swaying their bodies with smiles on their faces, as if engaged in conversation and laughter under pink and blue lighting. The camera tilts down from their faces, moving past their torsos to reveal their legs and feet, showing that the woman on the left has a prosthetic leg. The women remain relatively still throughout the camera movement.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor studio setting, a scene unfolds against a plain wall illuminated by vibrant pink and purple light. A vertical, glowing light tube stands on the floor, casting a bright, cool-toned light. Three women in dresses and heels are positioned around this light source. The camera tilts downward to focus on their lower legs and feet on the reflective floor, revealing that one woman wears a black prosthetic leg with intricate dark patterns, fitted with a black heeled shoe.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium shot of three women positioned in the foreground: one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right, all standing before a background wall. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, tilts downward, reframing the scene into a close-up of their lower legs and feet in the foreground. In the final composition, their legs are positioned around a vertical light tube that stands on the floor in the center of the frame, with the prosthetic leg of the woman from the left now prominently visible on the bottom left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
