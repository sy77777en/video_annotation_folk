  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames four figures in white full-body suits with hoods within a stark white room. Three figures are grouped on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, observing a black screen embedded in a white console. The tallest figure, wearing a red top hat over their hood, stands slightly behind the other two on the right. A fourth figure is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, initially looking towards the group on the right with a look of anxiety before turning their head to face the screen. The static camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus to keep all subjects sharp within a large depth of field. The person on the far left glances at the person on the far right and says something. The person on the far right, who is taller and wearing a red top hat, begins to operate the console, causing a small, indistinct white figure to appear in the center of the screen. The figure gradually becomes more defined, resembling a human silhouette. The screen is embedded in a console located in the center-left middle ground, with a control panel featuring several buttons beneath it. The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the shot. The white suits have thin orange or red piping details, and the environment is characterized by its stark whiteness, enhancing the focus on the figures and the screen.",

    "Subject": "The video shows four people dressed in identical white full-body suits with hoods covering their heads. At first, three of the people on the right are clustered together, looking towards a screen embedded in a white console, while the person on the far left turns their head to face them, with a look of anxiety. Then, she turned her head to look at the screen as well, before glancing at the person on the far right and saying something. The person on the far right, who is taller than the others and wears a red top hat over their white hood, looks at the screen and begins to operate something. Initially, the screen is black, but then a small, indistinct white figure, resembling a person, appears in the center of the screen.",
    "Motion": "Four individuals dressed in white full-body suits with hoods cover their heads are gathered around a black screen embedded in a white console. The person on the far left, initially looking at the others, turns to face the screen, and then glances at the person on the far right, and says something. The person on the far right, who is taller and wearing a red top hat, begins to operate the console, causing a small white figure to appear on the screen. The figure gradually becomes more defined, resembling a human silhouette.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors within a stark white room. Four figures clad in white hooded suits, one distinguished by a maroon top hat worn over the hood, are gathered around a monitor placed on a white table. Beneath the screen, which initially appears black but later shows a small, indistinct white figure, is a control panel featuring several buttons. The white suits have thin orange or red piping details.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
