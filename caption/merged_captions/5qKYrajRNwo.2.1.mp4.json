  "merged_caption": "The video presents a stop-motion claymation scene with a medium shot of two characters in a warm, rustic indoor setting. The main character, a man with a medium skin tone, curly dark hair, and a prominent mustache, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved, striped shirt. He stands at a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects like a cloth, a bottle, and a small container, actively engaging with these items. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground and remains completely static throughout. The man picks up a card from the table and places it into his shirt pocket, then adjusts his shirt and turns his entire body to look at the woman behind him. The woman, with a medium skin tone and dark hair, is initially in the middleground towards the right side of the frame, dressed in a bright orange outer garment with a dark blue inner garment. She is initially bent over, then stands up and turns sideways, revealing her upper body and facial features, moving slightly towards the center-right. Her 3D position remains in the middleground throughout. The background includes a cluttered workshop environment with various tools and hanging items, suggesting a workshop or craft area, and remains static throughout the sequence. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.",

    "Camera": "The video is a stop-motion animation with the camera positioned at eye level and a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a claymation scene with two characters. The main character is a man with a medium skin tone, curly dark hair, and a prominent mustache. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved, striped shirt and is positioned at a table, interacting with objects in front of him. His expression is neutral, and he appears focused on his task. In the background, another character, a woman with a medium skin tone and dark hair, is visible. She is dressed in a bright orange outer garment with a dark blue inner garment. She stands up and turns sideways, revealing her upper body and facial features. The setting suggests a workshop or kitchen environment, with various items around them.",
    "Motion": "The man, standing at a table with various items including a cloth, a bottle, and a small container, picks up a card from the table and places it into his shirt pocket.

    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The environment features a cluttered workspace with various tools and materials, suggesting a workshop or craft area. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects and containers. The walls are adorned with hanging items, adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing them from the waist up. The main character, a man, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, actively engaging with objects on a table directly in front of him. His 2D position is central, while his 3D position places him in the foreground. The table, with various items such as bottles and containers, is also in the foreground, slightly below the man. Another character, a woman, is initially in the middleground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. Her 2D position shifts as she stands up and turns sideways, moving slightly towards the center-right. Her 3D position remains in the middleground throughout. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects, keeping both characters within the frame consistently. The background includes a cluttered workshop environment with tools and hanging items, which remain static throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera movement, maintaining a steady focus on the interaction between the man and the surrounding objects, as well as the woman's subtle repositioning."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
