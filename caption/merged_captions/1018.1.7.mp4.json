  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men walking through a train corridor. The primary subject, a man in a green and red cap, white shirt, dark vest, and tie, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, holding a small tree wrapped in netting. He consistently remains at the center of the frame as he moves forward with a determined expression. In the middle ground, another man wearing a Santa hat and dark coat follows closely behind, maintaining a consistent position slightly to the left of the frame. The corridor's soft green walls and linear ceiling design form the backdrop, with doors on the left and windows on the right. The camera is positioned at the subjects' hip level, capturing their forward motion without any noticeable change in shot size or angle. The camera features a low angle, looking up, and employs deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves smoothly backward, leading the man in the foreground who is holding a wrapped object. The scene is set inside a train carriage with a vintage design, featuring bright and evenly distributed lighting, suggesting daytime. The environment is clean and orderly, with smooth surfaces and a polished finish. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the movement of the two men along the corridor, with the camera keeping pace to maintain their positions within the frame. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely. The train's interior provides a structured and enclosed setting, with natural light streaming in through the windows on the right side.",

    "Motion": "A man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie, is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. He is walking forward with a determined expression, while another man in a Santa hat and dark coat follows him closely. The background shows the interior of a train with light green walls and windows on either side of the corridor.",
    "Scene": "The video is set inside a train carriage with a vintage design, featuring soft green walls and a narrow corridor. The lighting is bright and evenly distributed, suggesting daytime. The ceiling has a sleek, linear design with subtle lighting fixtures. The environment is clean and orderly, with smooth surfaces and a polished finish. On the right side, there are windows that allow natural light to stream in, while the left side features doors. A person in a uniform, holding a netted bundle, walks through the corridor, accompanied by another individual wearing a Santa hat. The scene conveys a sense of movement as they proceed down the aisle, with the train's interior providing a structured and enclosed setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
