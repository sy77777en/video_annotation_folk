  "merged_caption": "The shot begins with a large, dark cloth in the middle ground, obscuring most of the frame except for the top of a circular object. Insect-like creatures in the bottom left and right corners of the frame pull the cloth away toward the left, revealing a large, intricate, circular sculpture. As the cloth is removed, small objects can be seen hanging on the vines surrounding the sculpture in the dark room. The camera, from a low angle, hip-level perspective, smoothly and slowly moves forward while tilting up, revealing the full shot of the sculpture. This large, ornate, circular structure stands in the center of a dark, cavernous room illuminated by a single overhead light. The sculpture, resembling a shattered clock or wheel, is constructed from dark, thorny, vine-like tendrils that form a complex, web-like structure with intricate patterns. At its center is a large, shattered, reflective surface resembling a broken mirror. Arranged around the circumference of this central piece are several small, rectangular, black-and-white photographs. Chains of small objects hang on the side of the sculpture, adding to the intricate design. In the final composition, the sculpture is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A pale object rests in the bottom left middle ground among dark, tangled vines that spread across the bottom of the frame. At the base of the sculpture, more of the dark, thorny vines are tangled around a small, mechanical device with visible gears. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the background in sharp detail, capturing the intricate details of the sculpture and its surroundings.",

    "Subject": "A black cloth is pulled away to reveal a large, intricate, circular sculpture in a dark, dusty room. The sculpture is composed of dark, thorny, vine-like tendrils that form a complex, web-like structure. At its center is a large, shattered, reflective surface resembling a broken mirror. Arranged around the circumference of this central piece are several small, rectangular, black-and-white photographs. The entire apparatus is illuminated by a spotlight from above, and chains of small objects hang on the side of the sculpture. At the base of the sculpture, more of the dark, thorny vines are tangled around a small, mechanical device with visible gears. To the left on the floor, a pale object rests among the vines.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, cavernous room illuminated by a single overhead light, a large, ornate, circular structure stands in the center. This object, resembling a shattered clock or wheel, is constructed from dark, thorny, metallic-looking material with intricate patterns and a fractured, mirror-like surface. Small, rectangular frames holding black-and-white photographs are positioned around its circumference. Small objects hang on the vines, adding to the intricate design. In the foreground, insect-like creatures at the lower left and right corners of the frame are pulling away a large, dark cloth in the middle ground, gradually revealing the complex structure before moving out of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The shot begins with a large, dark cloth in the middle ground, obscuring most of the frame except for the top of a circular object. Insect-like creatures in the bottom left and right corners of the frame pull the cloth away toward the left, transitioning the view into a full shot that reveals a large, intricate sculpture. In the final composition, the sculpture is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A pale object rests in the bottom left middle ground among dark, tangled vines that spread across the bottom of the frame. Small objects hang on the vines throughout the scene, from the foreground to the background. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
