  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a large, light-yellow, oblong squash rests on a white block in the center middle ground, with a thick green vine attached to its left end and a dried, woody stem protruding from the right. To its right, a dark green baseball cap with a circular logo featuring an orange graphic and white text that reads \"Giant Pumpkins\" and \"San Mateo\" is positioned in the bottom right middle ground on a wooden table that spans the lower half of the frame. The scene is set inside a structure with white fabric walls, providing a clear view of the squash and its vine. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, positioned at a high, eye-level angle, looking down at the objects with deep focus, keeping the squash and its surroundings in sharp detail. In this time-lapse video, played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, the squash initially appears on the rectangular platform, but as the video progresses, the platform disappears, and the squash is shown resting directly on the wooden table in the center middle ground, with the white block having been removed from the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse shot, played forward at a greatly accelerated speed. The camera is positioned at a high, eye-level angle, looking down on the scene. A deep focus is used, keeping the pumpkin and its surroundings in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A large, light-yellow, oblong squash rests horizontally on a white, rectangular block. The squash is ribbed, with a thick, green vine attached to its left end and a dried, woody stem protruding from the right. To the right of the squash, a dark green baseball cap sits on a wooden surface. The cap features a circular logo on the front with an orange graphic in the center and white text that reads \"Giant Pumpkins\" and \"San Mateo\". In this time-lapse video, the squash initially appears on the rectangular platform, but as the video progresses, the platform disappears, and the squash is shown resting directly on the table.",
    "Motion": "The video shows the squash on a vine, initially supported by a white block. In a time-lapse effect, the block disappears, and the squash is repositioned directly onto the wooden surface.",
    "Scene": "Inside a structure with white fabric walls, a large, light-yellow, oblong squash is displayed on a pale, rectangular block. The block and squash are positioned on a wooden plank surface. A thick green vine, still attached to the squash, extends to the left. Next to the squash on the right is a dark green baseball cap with a circular logo on its front. The scene offers a clear view of the squash and its vine.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a large yellow squash rests on a white block in the center middle ground. To its right, a green baseball cap is positioned in the bottom right middle ground on a wooden table that spans the lower half of the frame. A green vine attached to the squash extends from the middle ground towards both the foreground and the background, against a backdrop of white fabric walls. The video then transitions, showing the squash now resting directly on the wooden table in the center middle ground, with the white block having been removed from the scene. The camera remains completely static throughout the video and is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the objects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
