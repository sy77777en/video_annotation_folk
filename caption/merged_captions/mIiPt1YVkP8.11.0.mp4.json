  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of an airport from a level angle perspective, focusing on the scenery with no main subjects. In the foreground, a dark gray paved taxiway with a solid yellow centerline curves from the bottom of the frame toward the center, merging into a long, straight runway that occupies the middle ground, stretching from the center of the frame into the distant background. The surrounding terrain is flat and green, marked by a grid-like pattern of other taxiways. In the background, the simple, blocky silhouettes of buildings form a minimalist cityscape on the horizon, partially obscured by a thick, reddish-purple haze. A bright, glowing sun hangs low in the sky on the right, casting a soft glow over the scene. From a smooth, aerial perspective, the camera moves backward, pans right, and moves left, offering a view down the airport taxiway. The camera maintains a level angle, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the distant, hazy cityscape, in sharp detail, creating a continuous clockwise arc. The scene is bathed in a hazy, reddish-purple light, with the sun low on the horizon, enhancing the atmospheric, almost surreal quality of the light and fog, creating a sense of quiet desolation. The video captures the expansive scale of the airport and the atmospheric conditions at either sunrise or sunset, with the camera looking down a long, straight taxiway that curves at the bend. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green, grassy terrain, and the bright, round sun sits low on the horizon, casting a soft glow over the entire scene.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, aerial perspective, the camera moves backward, pans right, and moves left, offering a view down an airport taxiway. The camera maintains a level angle, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the distant, hazy cityscape, in sharp detail, creating a continuous clockwise arc.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a stylized scenery shot of a vast, empty airport at either sunrise or sunset. The camera looks down a long, straight runway that stretches into the hazy distance, while a curving taxiway with yellow centerlines merges into it from the foreground. The surrounding flat, green terrain is marked by a grid-like pattern of other taxiways and simple, blocky buildings that form a minimalist cityscape on the horizon under a thick, reddish-purple haze, with a bright, glowing sun hanging low in the sky. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the expansive scale of the airport and the atmospheric, almost surreal, quality of the light and fog, creating a sense of quiet desolation.",
    "Motion": "This is a computer-generated video of an airport taxiway at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is bathed in a hazy, reddish-purple light, with the sun low on the horizon. The camera looks down a long, straight taxiway that curves at the bend.",
    "Scene": "The scene depicts an airport taxiway at either dawn or dusk under a hazy, reddish-purple sky. A bright, round sun sits low on the horizon, casting a soft glow. In the foreground, a dark gray paved taxiway with a solid yellow centerline curves and merges with a longer, straight runway that stretches into the distance. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green, grassy terrain. In the distant background, the simple, blocky silhouettes of buildings are partially obscured by the atmospheric haze.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of an airport from a level angle perspective. The focus is on the scenery, as there are no main subjects. In the foreground, a paved taxiway curves from the bottom of the frame toward the center. This taxiway merges into a long, straight runway that occupies the middle ground, stretching from the center of the frame into the distant background. The surrounding terrain is flat and green. In the background, the silhouettes of blocky buildings are visible across the horizon, with a bright sun positioned on the right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
