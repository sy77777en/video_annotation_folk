  "merged_caption": "A full, low-angle fisheye shot initially frames a man on a skateboard in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, loose-fitting blue jeans, white sneakers, and has brown hair. A large stone monument occupies the middle ground, extending from the left to the center, with a building visible in the background on the right. The man skateboards from the center toward the right, riding along the straight stairs leading up to the monument, which appear curved due to the fisheye lens effect. He bends his knees and uses his arms to balance, then turns and rides off a small ledge onto the flat pavement, continuing to roll forward with his arms extended to his sides. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and performs an unsteady, shaky truck to the right to follow the skateboarder. During the right pan, the camera also elevates and tilts downward, helping achieve the level perspective. The skater descends the steps before this, and the video concludes with the skater making it past the steps. In the background, standing on a stone ledge, another person is visible, wearing a dark-colored outfit. This person is positioned beside a square pillar with statues on each side. The scene is set in an outdoor urban plaza under a cloudy daytime sky, with a large, multi-story building with a classical facade and numerous windows lining the edge of the plaza. The distorted perspective curves the horizon and frames the scene within a circular view, with the base of the monument featuring straight stairs that appear curved due to the fisheye lens effect.",

    "Camera": "This video is filmed with a prominent fisheye lens from a low, ground-level angle that shifts to a level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. To follow the skateboarder, the camera performs an unsteady, shaky truck to the right. During the right pan, the camera also elevates and tilts downward, helping achieve the level perspective. The skater descends the steps before this, and the video concludes with the skater making it past the steps.",
    "Subject": "A man is shown skateboarding. He is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, loose-fitting blue jeans, white sneakers, and has brown hair. He actively balances on the skateboard, shifting his weight and moving his arms. In the background, standing on a stone ledge, another person is visible, wearing a dark-colored outfit. This person is positioned beside a square pillar with statues on each side.",
    "Motion": "A skateboarder rides along the straight stairs leading up to the monument, which appear curved due to the fisheye lens effect. He bends his knees and uses his arms to balance, then turns and rides off a small ledge onto the flat pavement, continuing to roll forward with his arms extended to his sides.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, fisheye shot captures an outdoor urban plaza under a cloudy daytime sky. The distorted perspective curves the horizon and frames the scene within a circular view. In the center is a large, dark stone monument with several tiers and prominent statues on top. The base of the monument features straight stairs, which appear curved due to the fisheye lens effect. In the background, a large, multi-story building with a classical facade and numerous windows lines the edge of the plaza. A person on a skateboard is seen moving along the straight stairs of the monument.",
    "Spatial": "A full, low-angle fisheye shot initially frames a man on a skateboard in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A large stone monument occupies the middle ground, extending from the left to the center, with a building visible in the background on the right. The man skateboards from the center toward the right, and the camera follows this movement, transitioning from its initial position below the subject to a position at the subject's level as he moves away from the step and the stairs."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
