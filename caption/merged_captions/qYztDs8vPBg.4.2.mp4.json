  "merged_caption": "An extreme close-up shot, filmed from above, captures a gold-colored smartphone and a silver utility knife held by a pair of light-skinned hands in the foreground. The smartphone is positioned diagonally, extending from the left side toward the center of the frame, with its prominent triple-lens camera module visible. The utility knife is held on the right, its sharp, angled blade pressed against the gold-colored metal ring of one of the camera lenses near the center, suggesting a scratch test is being performed. The hands holding these objects are visible on the left and right edges of the frame. The entire scene is set against a mostly plain white surface in the background, with indistinct black and yellow objects, possibly boxes, blurred in the background. The scene is brightly and evenly lit, indicating an indoor setting. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone and utility knife prominently positioned in the foreground. This is a static, high-angle shot from an overhead POV where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective. A hand moves the utility knife, scraping its blade back and forth across the metal ring of a camera lens on the gold-colored smartphone, while the phone is held stationary. The framing remains static throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, high-angle shot. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone and utility knife prominently positioned in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds a gold-colored smartphone and a silver metal utility knife. The close-up shot focuses on the back of the phone, where a prominent camera module with three lenses is visible. The sharp, angled blade of the utility knife is pressed against the gold-colored metal ring of one of the camera lenses, suggesting a scratch test is being performed.",
    "Motion": "A hand moves a utility knife, scraping its blade back and forth across the metal ring of a camera lens on a gold-colored smartphone. The phone is held stationary as the blade is pressed against the metal surface.",
    "Scene": "From an overhead POV where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, the scene is a close-up against a mostly plain white background. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored smartphone, its prominent triple-lens camera module visible. The blade of a silver utility knife is pressed against one of the circular, gold-rimmed lenses. The entire scene is brightly and evenly lit, indicating an indoor setting, with indistinct black and yellow objects, possibly boxes, blurred in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
