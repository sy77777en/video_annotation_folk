  "merged_caption": "The video is a close-up shot set in a dark, enclosed space, possibly the interior of a vehicle. It opens with a white cigarette pack, visibly wet with small droplets, positioned in the middle ground. The pack features white text outlined in dark red, accompanied by a blue pattern, with the word \"RELAX\" in a stylized font and the phrase \"ENJOY YOUR\" prominently displayed. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down, and initially appears slightly out of focus. A dark, reflective surface, also showing droplets, occupies the top and central portions of the frame, with a red reflection noticeable in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves downward at the start, revealing more of the cigarette pack and the surrounding area, then stops and remains stationary for the remainder of the video. Once stationary, it transitions to focus on a light-skinned human hand, wet with water droplets, that enters the frame from the left middle ground. The hand moves across to the pack in the center left, grasps it, and subsequently pulls both itself and the pack out of the frame towards the left. The final frame shows the empty dark, wet surface where the cigarette pack was previously placed.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down, and initially appears slightly out of focus. The camera smoothly moves downward at the start, then stops and remains stationary for the remainder of the video. Once stationary, it transitions to focus to a hand that enters the frame and picks up a cigarette pack in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "This close-up video focuses on a white pack of cigarettes featuring white text outlined in dark red, accompanied by a blue pattern. Prominently displayed on the pack is the word \"RELAX\" in a stylized font, along with the phrase \"ENJOY YOUR.\" The surface of the cigarette pack appears wet, covered in small droplets. Subsequently, a light-skinned human hand enters the frame from the lower right and grasps the pack, removing it from sight.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a white cigarette pack with a red logo and the word 'RELAX' on it, placed on a dark, wet surface. The camera slowly moves downward, revealing more of the cigarette pack and the surrounding area. A hand, wet with water droplets, reaches into the frame and grasps the cigarette pack. The hand lifts the cigarette pack off the surface and moves it out of the frame. The final frame shows the empty dark, wet surface where the cigarette pack was previously placed.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, enclosed space, possibly the interior of a vehicle. A cigarette case, predominantly white with red and blue markings and the word \"RELAX\" visible, is present. The surrounding environment is dimly lit, with reflections and what appear to be water droplets above. A red reflection is visible on the right side of the frame. A hand appears, takes the cigarette case, and then exits the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video is a close-up shot. It opens with a white cigarette pack, visibly wet with small droplets, positioned in the middle ground. The camera is initially positioned slightly above this pack, also framing a dark, reflective surface (which also shows droplets) that occupies the top and central portions of the frame; a red reflection is noticeable in the foreground of this surface. As the sequence progresses, the camera moves downwards, focusing more on the pack. A hand then enters from the left middle ground, moves across to the pack in the center left, grasps it, and subsequently pulls both itself and the pack out of the frame towards the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
