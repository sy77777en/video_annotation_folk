  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a woman with blonde hair tied back is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, hiking steadily up a narrow, grassy trail on a steep mountain ridge during the daytime. She is wearing a black long-sleeved top, black shorts that end above her knees, and dark athletic shoes with light green patterns, and carries a black backpack with white markings on its surface. The path recedes from the bottom of the frame, with a craggy, gray rock face occupying the right side of the frame, while on the left, a steep grassy slope drops off into a deep valley surrounded by massive, sheer rock walls visible in the background on the far left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the hiker from behind, keeping her centered in the frame as she moves steadily away from the camera and up the path. This is an unsteady, eye-level, level-angle shot that tracks the hiker from behind as she moves forward along the narrow mountain path. The camera rolls and shakes, creating a varying Dutch angle that suggests a handheld or point-of-view perspective. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the hiker in the midground and the vast mountain landscape in the background sharp. The slope is covered in green grass and small wildflowers, adding to the rugged beauty of the scene. This is a first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, enhancing the immersive experience of the hike up the steep incline with a deep valley to her left.",

    "Scene": "A person is seen from behind, hiking up a narrow, grassy trail on a steep mountain ridge during the daytime. To the right of the path is a craggy, gray rock face, and to the left is a steep drop-off into a deep valley surrounded by massive, sheer rock walls. The slope is covered in green grass and small wildflowers. The hiker wears all-black athletic clothing and a black backpack as they move steadily up the rugged path.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
