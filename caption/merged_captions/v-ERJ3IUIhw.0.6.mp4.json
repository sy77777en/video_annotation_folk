  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a blue pen sketch, initially depicting two building-like forms connected by an arch, all centrally located against a white background. The left form, featuring a starburst pattern, and the right form are positioned to the left and right of the center, respectively, with the arch connecting them in the upper-middle part of the frame. The video begins with a sketch of a building with a central clock and symmetrical windows. Suddenly, the building starts to crack and collapse, initiating from the left side, with pieces breaking off and falling. The structure continues to disintegrate, with the left section breaking apart more severely than the right. During the animation, this entire sketched entity remains central while it morphs: the left section deconstructs as the structure lowers and widens, evolving into an organic shape. This new form features multiple tapering, leg-like supports emerging at the bottom center and a broad, undulating canopy developing across the upper-central area, with some elements extending towards the right. The transformation completes with the building fully morphing into a complex, abstract form with multiple legs and a large canopy, resembling a creature or a futuristic structure. The drawing style is loose and sketchy, with visible construction lines and hatching used for shading and form. The camera remains static throughout, maintaining a consistent, objective viewpoint, appearing slightly elevated or at eye-level to the 2D sketch.",

    "Subject": "The video features a blue pen sketch on a white background, depicting the animated transformation of an architectural or abstract structure. Initially, the sketch shows two block-like building sections connected by an arch; the left section has a starburst pattern emanating from its facade, suggesting an explosion or impact, with some visible rectangular windows, while the right section displays a grid of similar windows. As the animation progresses, this structure morphs into a more organic, multi-legged form. The initial building elements appear to evolve into curved, tapering leg-like supports, and a large, wavy, shaded canopy or roof structure develops over the central area, while other parts extend into pointed or tentacle-like appendages. The drawing style is loose and sketchy, with visible construction lines and hatching used for shading and form.",

Suddenly, the building starts to crack and collapse, initiating from the left side, with pieces breaking off and falling. The structure continues to disintegrate, with the left section breaking apart more severely than the right. The building's form becomes increasingly abstract, with the legs and canopy taking on more fluid and organic shapes. The transformation completes with the building fully morphing into a complex, abstract form with multiple legs and a large canopy, resembling a creature or a futuristic structure.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an objective, observational perspective, showcases a blue pen sketch on a white background. Initially, it depicts two connected, somewhat angular building-like forms, with lines radiating from the facade of the left structure and an archway joining it to the right. This sketched edifice then undergoes a fluid transformation: the left section deconstructs as the entire entity morphs into a lower, wider organic shape. This new form is supported by multiple tapering, leg-like pillars and is covered by a broad, undulating, shaded canopy, with the sketchy lines animating to illustrate this continuous metamorphosis.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
