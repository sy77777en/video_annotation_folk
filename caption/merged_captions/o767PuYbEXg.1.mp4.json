  "merged_caption": "The video captures a breathtaking aerial view of a pod of large whales swimming near the ocean's surface, filmed from above likely by a drone. The whales are primarily in the center and left of the frame, with some moving towards the upper left and others towards the lower left. The scene is dynamic, with several whales breaking the surface, creating white foam and circular ripples, while others remain mostly submerged, their turquoise flippers visible through the water. The camera maintains a high angle, looking down at the scene, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean and the movement of the whales. The ocean's surface is a deep blue, with swirling white foam indicating the whales' activity beneath. In the upper left corner of the frame, two whales are swimming and leaping towards the upper left, their heads and backs emerging and creating significant white foam and circular ripples as they propel themselves forward before diving back below the surface. Meanwhile, the rest of the whales in the group remain mostly submerged, their bright turquoise pectoral flippers visible as they swim underwater towards the lower left. The whales move together in a cluster, with the main group progressing in unison. The setting is outdoors, with no visible land, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests it is during daylight hours. Notable visual elements include the dynamic patterns created by the water's movement, with areas of lighter blue and turquoise, as well as whales breaching, which creates white foam and circular ripples. The scene is devoid of any architectural features, focusing solely on the natural environment. The \"BBC\" logo is visible in the top left corner.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial view at a high angle, looking down on a group of whales in the ocean. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a pod of large whales swimming near the surface of dark blue ocean water. The whales have dark gray or black dorsal sides, with some displaying white or light-colored markings on their undersides or pectoral flippers, which appear as distinct, bright turquoise patches when viewed through the water. Several whales are actively moving, with some breaking the surface, their heads and backs becoming visible and creating significant white foam and circular ripples. Other whales remain mostly submerged, with their turquoise flippers being the most prominent visible feature. The whales are clustered together, interacting and moving as a group, with several whales heading towards the upper left corner of the frame, while most are moving towards the lower left corner.",

    "Scene": "The video, likely filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view looking down at the ocean surface, showcasing a deep blue sea with swirling white foam and bubbles created by whales swimming near the surface.

Notable visual elements include the dynamic patterns created by the water's movement, with areas of lighter blue and turquoise, as well as whales breaching, which creates white foam and circular ripples.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
