  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot, filmed from the driver's right front position, frames a light-skinned man with dark brown, short hair and a short, well-groomed beard in the right half of the screen. He is seated in the driver's seat of a car at night, wearing a dark t-shirt under a rust-colored jacket, with his hands on a black steering wheel with a red stripe at the top in the bottom right foreground. To the left, the car's side mirror occupies the bottom left foreground, while a portion of the red car's body is visible in the middle ground. A street at night is visible outside the car, extending from the very left foreground into the background, flanked by light-colored buildings and illuminated by streetlights in the distance. The camera, fixed in front of the car at eye level, faces the driver and leads the car by moving backward as the vehicle drives forward, with slight pans to match its turns. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, while a shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the driver in the midground. The man grips the steering wheel as he drives, keeping his gaze directed forward and turning his head slightly to the right as the car moves. The interior of his car is dark, and water droplets begin to appear on the windshield, slightly obscuring the view of the man and becoming more noticeable as the car moves forward and light reflects off the glass. Throughout the shot, there is noticeable movement, and the driver's side mirror on the left and a portion of the red car body, part of the vehicle he is driving, are visible.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot is captured by a camera fixed in front of the car, facing the driver. The camera leads the car by moving backward as the vehicle drives forward, with slight pans to match its turns. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the driver in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with dark brown, short hair and a short, well-groomed beard sits in the driver's seat of a car at night. He wears a dark t-shirt under a rust-colored jacket. With one hand gripping the black steering wheel, which has a red stripe at the top, he looks forward with a focused expression. The interior of his car is dark, and a portion of a red car is visible just outside his window.",
    "Motion": "A man sits in the driver's seat, gripping the steering wheel as he drives a car down a street at night. He keeps his gaze directed forward, turning his head slightly to the right as the car moves.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, mounted inside a vehicle, captures a nighttime drive along an urban street. The road is flanked by light-colored buildings and illuminated by streetlights in the distance. The primary focus is on a man driving, his hands on a black steering wheel with a red marking. The car's dark interior is visible, with the driver's side mirror on the left. Outside the window, a portion of the red car body, part of the vehicle he is driving, is visible. Water droplets are present on the windshield throughout the video, becoming more noticeable as the car moves forward and light reflects off the glass.",
    "Spatial": "A medium close-up shot, filmed from the driver's right front position, frames a man in the right half of the screen. He is seated in the driver's seat, with his hands on the steering wheel in the bottom right foreground. To the left, the car's side mirror occupies the bottom left foreground, while a portion of the red car's body is visible in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
