  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire zoo enclosure and its surroundings. Several deer with slender bodies, light brown fur, and white markings are distributed across the middle ground: one deer stands at the bottom right, facing the camera, while other deer are positioned throughout the middle ground, with some near the left and right edges and others partially obscured by the shelter structure at the center. The shelter, made of metal bars and a flat roof, occupies the central middle ground, with a rocky wall and two rectangular doorways in the background, spanning the width of the frame. Trees with dense green foliage extend from the top left to the top right, casting shade over the scene. The camera, positioned at eye level and set to a level angle, smoothly pans and trucks right to capture the zoo enclosure and the deer situated in the middle ground, briefly pausing mid-movement. Deep focus ensures both the deer and the background enclosure remain sharp throughout. Several deer move around within the enclosed area. On the left, one deer initially jumps up, then remains still, and finally lowers its head. In the bottom right corner of the frame, a deer looks towards the camera and remains motionless. Behind and to the right of the shelter, one deer moves to the left while another moves towards the shelter and lowers its head. Inside the shelter, a deer lowers its head to eat something. The camera movement is steady with minimal shaking, providing a level perspective across the enclosure. The overall scene is bright, indicating daytime with clear weather, and no overlays or digital elements are present. The group of deer appears calm and alert, with their heads raised and ears pointed forward.",

    "Camera": "The handheld camera, positioned at eye level and set to a level angle, smoothly pans and trucks right to capture the zoo enclosure and the deer situated in the middle ground, briefly pausing mid-movement.

    "Subject": "The video shows several deer with slender bodies, light brown fur, and white markings on their backs and tails. Some of the deer have short, straight antlers, while others do not, suggesting a mix of males and females. The deer are standing or walking in different areas, with one deer facing forward in the lower right corner and others positioned farther back or to the sides. The group appears calm and alert, with their heads raised and ears pointed forward.",
    "Motion": "Several deer move around within an enclosed area. On the left, one deer initially jumps up, then remains still, and finally lowers its head.

Behind and to the right of the shelter, one deer moves to the left while another moves towards the shelter and lowers its head. Inside the shelter, a deer lowers its head to eat something.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor zoo enclosure surrounded by lush green trees with dense foliage, casting dappled shade over the sandy ground. The enclosure is bordered by metal railings and fencing, with a simple shelter structure made of metal bars and a flat roof at the center. Behind the shelter, a rocky wall with dark, uneven surfaces and two rectangular doorways is visible, suggesting access points for animals or staff. Scattered branches and logs lie on the ground, adding texture to the otherwise smooth, light brown sand. Several deer with light brown coats and white markings are present within the enclosure, some standing near the shelter and others positioned in the middle ground. The overall scene is bright, indicating daytime with clear weather, and no overlays or digital elements are present.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire zoo enclosure and its surroundings.

Trees with dense green foliage extend from the top left to the top right, casting shade over the scene. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the deer, providing a level perspective across the enclosure. There are no significant movements or changes in shot size or spatial arrangement during the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
