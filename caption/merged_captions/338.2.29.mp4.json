  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot capturing multiple subjects and the surrounding restaurant environment. The main focus is on two women seated at a table, initially positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the center-right of the frame. The woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, is on the left side, while the woman in the denim jacket with light hair styled with volume is on the right. The table is set with plates of food and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and a staff member in a white shirt and maroon vest are visible, moving through the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, starting with a focus on the midground with a shallow depth of field. As the camera smoothly moves forward and slightly pans left, it shifts focus to center on the woman eating an ice cream cone in the foreground. She raises her hand to greet someone passing by, then lowers her hand and starts licking her ice cream cone. The woman next to her is talking and gesturing with her left hand while holding chopsticks in her right hand. The camera then transitions to a medium close-up shot, focusing more closely on the two women. The woman with dark hair is now more prominently on the left, and the woman in the denim jacket is on the right. The table remains in the foreground, but less of the surrounding restaurant is visible. The setting is a cozy, warmly lit indoor restaurant with classic, slightly ornate decor, featuring round tables with white tablecloths and dark wooden chairs. The walls are adorned with intricate, gold-toned decorative panels and artwork, creating a lively atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
