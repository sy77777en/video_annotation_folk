  "merged_caption": "The scene is framed with a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat's head positioned in the left foreground, featuring a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers. Its expression changes from initially angry to shocked after being punched, and then it becomes even angrier. In the right foreground, a smaller, red cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in red shorts with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat is shown in a full-body shot, hovering on a small white cloud against a background of dark, realistic structures, including a dark brick wall and a blurry dark structure with blurred white lights. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this sequence, starting with an eye-level, level-angle shot with a smooth, minor zoom-out. The animated characters, Tom and a devil version of himself, remain sharp throughout. The real-world background begins out of focus and then shifts to an ultra-shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground of the real-world background sharp. A small red cat dressed as a devil jumps upward from a white cloud and punches a large gray cat in the nose. The red cat then lands back on the cloud, which floats in front of the gray cat. The red cat stands on the cloud, holding a red trident and facing the gray cat with a menacing expression. The scene's lighting is dim, suggesting it takes place after dark. In the background, an out-of-focus grated iron gate reveals numerous scattered white lights.",

    "Subject": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. On the left is a close-up of the head of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers; its expression changes from initially angry to shocked after being punched, and then it becomes even angrier. To the right, a much smaller, full-bodied cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in red shorts with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat, holding a red trident, is positioned on a small white cloud and faces the larger cat with a menacing expression.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
