  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man with dark skin, a large black afro, a mustache, and a light beard, centered in the frame and shown from the chest up. He wears a textured, bright red sweater and is positioned alongside a white tub in the foreground. His mouth is slightly open, and his eyebrows are raised as he looks toward the right side of the frame. In the background, mannequin heads with various hairstyles are displayed on shelves to the left, with a lit lampshade also on the left and a neon sign in the top left. An arched mirror framed by vertical orange tube lights is in the background on the right, reflecting another section of the checkerboard wall and additional mannequin heads. The scene is set indoors in a stylized room with dim, atmospheric lighting, cast in a teal-green hue. The camera begins with a level angle on the man and then dollies backward, maintaining the level angle, transitioning to a medium shot with the camera positioned at the subject's level. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, and while the focus appears to be deep, the image is too blurry to be certain. The man remains stationary, his body facing forward while his head is turned to his left, corresponding to the right side of the frame, holding a fixed facial expression and looking off-screen without any discernible movement. The room's back wall is covered in a black and white checkerboard pattern, upon which a purple neon sign and a lit lampshade are mounted. The mirror reflects another section of the checkerboard wall and additional mannequin heads on shelves. Several mannequin heads displaying wigs are also visible on shelves to the left.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a stylized room with dim, atmospheric lighting. A back wall is covered in a black and white checkerboard pattern, upon which a purple neon sign and a lit lampshade are mounted. The room is cast in a teal-green hue, contrasted by vertical orange tube lights that frame a large, arched mirror. The mirror reflects another section of the checkerboard wall and additional mannequin heads on shelves. Several mannequin heads displaying wigs are also visible on shelves to the left. A man in a textured red sweater is centrally located, sitting on a seat while holding a white basket in his hands.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
