  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot of a vast desert landscape characterized by rolling, golden-brown sand dunes under a hazy sky. A small, rudimentary wooden shelter stands in the sand, with a person dressed in dark blue or black clothing that covers their body and head, and two camels positioned beside it in the middle ground, slightly right of center. In the background, a blue car is visible in the top left, moving across the dunes. The camera, captured from a smooth, eye-level drone shot, rapidly moves forward and down, passing over the person and camels, which briefly occupy the foreground before blurring out of focus. The car speeds across the sand dunes, initially appearing in the background and then transitioning to the middle ground as the camera moves. The camera rolls slightly clockwise and pans right, creating a varying Dutch angle as it follows the blue car drifting around a dune, sending a large plume of sand into the air. The sequence transitions to a high-angle wide shot of the car, mostly obscured by the swirling sands. The motion transitions into slow motion, focusing on a close-up view of sand and small, dark pieces of debris being thrown into the air, flying directly toward the viewer. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the vast desert landscape sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video, featuring a speed ramp effect, is captured from a smooth, eye-level drone shot. The camera flies low over a desert, moving forward until it is near a racing car. To follow the car, the camera rolls slightly clockwise and pans right, creating a varying Dutch angle. As the car kicks up a large cloud of sand that momentarily obscures the lens, the motion transitions into slow motion. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the vast desert landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person, two camels, and a car. The person, dressed in dark blue or black clothing that covers their body and head, is sitting on the sand. Next to them, one light-brown camel stands with a dark pack on its back, while a second camel lies on the ground. A blue car speeds across the sand dunes, kicking up a large cloud of dust. The focus then shifts to a close-up, slow-motion view of the sand and small, dark pieces of debris being thrown into the air, flying directly toward the viewer.",
    "Motion": "A person and two camels remain stationary in the desert as a blue car speeds across the sand dunes, initially appearing in the background and then transitioning to the middleground as the camera moves. The car drifts around a dune, sending a large plume of sand into the air. The view shifts to a close-up, slow-motion shot of sand and small pieces of debris being thrown up and flying toward the camera.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a vast desert landscape characterized by rolling, golden-brown sand dunes under a hazy sky. A small, rudimentary wooden shelter stands in the sand, with two camels and a person positioned beside it. The drone's perspective shifts to dynamically follow a blue car as it speeds and drifts across the dunes, kicking up large plumes of sand. The sequence transitions to a close-up view of sand and small pebbles being propelled through the air toward the camera.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot of a desert, with a small shelter, a person, and two camels positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. In the background, a blue car is visible in the top left, moving across the dunes. The camera rapidly moves forward and down, passing over the person and camels, which briefly occupy the foreground before blurring out of focus. The camera then follows the blue car as it drifts across the middle ground, kicking up a large plume of sand. The shot transitions to a high-angle wide shot of the car, mostly obscured by the swirling sands."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
