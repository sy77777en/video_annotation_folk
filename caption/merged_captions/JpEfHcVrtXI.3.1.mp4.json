  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a wide shot throughout, with the camera positioned above the subject at an overhead level, roughly second-floor height, and maintains a level angle looking straight ahead. Initially, a stylized character wearing a blue top and dark lower body on a dark, glowing motorcycle is at the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground, driving along a dark asphalt road with bright white lane markings that extends from the immediate foreground into the distant background. Abstract, glowing purple and pink geometric buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and receding into the background. A numerical score is consistently displayed in the top left corner as a foreground overlay. Pink heart-shaped collectibles appear on the road in the middle ground ahead of the character. The character rides in the middle lane, then switches to the left lane while collecting items like diamonds and hearts. After performing a backflip off a small ramp, the character returns to the middle lane, remaining in the bottom center of the frame and the middle ground. As the character ascends a steep slope, they move upward along the slope before leaving the motorcycle. A series of large, glowing pink heart symbols line the long slope, becoming larger as the character approaches. A glowing cyan silhouette of a woman, transformed from the character, is superimposed over one of these heart symbols. The character then strikes a dynamic, dance-like pose in mid-air, consistently remaining in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, with the large heart symbols in the background. Pink laser-like lines are visible in the upper background. The camera primarily moves forward, tailing the motorcyclist, but also subtly shifts up, down, left, and right to follow the character's movements, becoming level with the subject as they ascend the slope.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an overhead level, roughly second-floor height, and maintains a level angle looking straight ahead. It tracks a video game character riding a motorcycle from above and behind. The camera primarily moves forward, tailing the motorcyclist, but also subtly shifts up, down, left, and right to follow the character's movements. Initially, the camera is above the subject, but as the character ascends a slope, the camera moves upward to become level with the subject. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a game scene featuring a small, stylized character wearing a blue top and dark lower body, riding a dark, glowing motorcycle on a dark road marked with bright white lines. The character navigates the road, switching from the middle lane to the left lane, performing a backflip off a ramp, and then returning to the middle lane. Along the way, the character collects various items like diamonds and hearts to earn points, with the score displayed in the top left corner. As the character ascends a long, steep slope, they leave the motorcycle and strike a dynamic, dance-like pose in mid-air. Later, a prominent, large, glowing cyan silhouette of a woman in a dynamic, almost dancing pose appears, superimposed over a large, glowing pink heart symbol. The scene is set within a city, with animated purple buildings framing the sides, and a car is visible on the right side of the road.",
    "Motion": "The character, riding a motorcycle, navigates through a neon-lit cityscape with multiple lanes and various obstacles. Initially, the character rides in the middle lane, then switches to the left lane while collecting items like diamonds and hearts. After performing a backflip off a small ramp, the character returns to the middle lane. The character then ascends a steep slope, leaving the motorcycle behind and striking a dance-like pose in mid-air. In a transformative moment, the character becomes a large, glowing silhouette of a woman in a dynamic pose, superimposed over a large, glowing pink heart symbol, appearing prominently at the middle bottom of the frame.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character consistently remains at the bottom of the frame, depicts a stylized nighttime drive through a futuristic city. The scene is set on a dark asphalt road with bright white lane markings, flanked by abstract, geometric buildings that glow with purple and pink neon light; some buildings feature patterns like playing card suits. Dark, silhouetted tree-like structures extend from above. The character, a figure in a blue jacket on a motorcycle, moves forward along the road, collecting pink heart-shaped objects. As these objects are collected, numbers appear above them and float upwards before disappearing. Beams of light emanate from the motorcycle's path as the scenery scrolls past. The environment evolves, leading to a point where a large, glowing pink heart-shaped structure becomes prominent, with pink laser-like lines visible in the upper background. Overlay elements include a numerical display in the top left corner, showing glowing pink and cyan digits that increment, and occasional brief UI elements like a yellow \"GO\" text appearing on the road.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a wide shot throughout, with the camera positioned above the subject. Initially, a stylized character on a motorcycle is at the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground, driving along a dark road that extends from the immediate foreground into the distant background. Abstract, glowing purple and pink geometric buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and receding into the background. A numerical score is consistently displayed in the top left corner as a foreground overlay. Pink heart-shaped collectibles appear on the road in the middle ground ahead of the character. The character moves from the center lane to the left lane, performs a backflip over a small slope, and then returns to the center lane, remaining in the bottom center of the frame and the middle ground. As the character ascends a steep slope, they move upward along the slope before leaving the motorcycle. A series of large, glowing pink heart symbols line the long slope, becoming larger as the character approaches. A glowing cyan silhouette of a woman, transformed from the character, is superimposed over one of these heart symbols. The character then strikes a pose in mid-air, consistently remaining in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, with the large heart symbols in the background. Pink laser-like lines are visible in the upper background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
