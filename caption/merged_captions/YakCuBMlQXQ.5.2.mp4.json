  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a blurry medium shot, showing a young adult woman with fair skin and long, wavy, platinum blonde hair, dressed in a black jacket over a white top and wearing a thick, black collar around her neck. She is positioned on the left side of the frame against an out-of-focus forest background composed of tall trees with dense, dark green foliage, suggesting a dimly lit forest during dusk or an overcast day. The woman runs into the frame from the left, and the scene starts out of focus, gradually sharpening to reveal her movement. As she advances towards the right and into the foreground, moving closer to the camera, she quickly turns her head to look from side to side, scanning her surroundings with an alert expression. The camera, positioned at eye level, initially tilts upward and then pans smoothly to the right, tracking her movement. During this motion, the camera's angle shifts from level to a low angle, employing a varying Dutch angle, and uses a shallow depth of field to keep her in focus. The framing transitions dynamically from a medium shot to a close-up that captures her head and upper torso, with the woman becoming larger in the frame. The shot ends with her positioned in the center-left of the frame, while the blurred trees remain in the middle ground and background. The camera movement is relatively smooth, with only minimal shaking, enhancing the overall viewing experience as it follows her, and the focus shifts from an initial blur to a clearer, though still soft, view of the subject.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot begins out of focus and gradually sharpens to reveal a woman running. The camera, using a shallow depth of field, tilts up at the start and then pans smoothly to the right to track her. During this movement, the camera's angle shifts from level to a low angle, and it employs a varying Dutch angle. As the camera follows the woman, she becomes larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A young adult woman with fair skin and long, wavy, platinum blonde hair appears in the video. She is dressed in a black jacket over a white top and wears a thick, black collar around her neck. Initially seen as a blurry figure, she comes into sharp focus as she moves, revealing an alert expression on her face as she looks from side to side. The shot transitions from a medium view to a close-up, focusing on her face and upper torso.",
    "Motion": "A woman runs into the frame from the left, and the scene starts out of focus, gradually sharpening to reveal her movement. She quickly turns her head to look from side to side, scanning her surroundings. The camera initially tilts upward and continuously pans to the right, keeping her in frame, and stops just before the end.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit forest during what appears to be dusk or on an overcast day. The background is composed of tall, out-of-focus trees with dense, dark green foliage, creating a soft, blurred environment. A woman with blonde hair, dressed in a dark jacket and wearing a thick, dark collar, is seen moving through the woods. The camera movement is relatively smooth, with only minimal shaking, enhancing the overall viewing experience as it follows her, and the focus shifts from an initial blur to a clearer, though still soft, view of the subject.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a blurry medium shot, showing the woman's upper body on the left side of the frame against an out-of-focus forest background. She runs from the left towards the right and into the foreground, moving closer to the camera. As she advances, the focus sharpens on her, and the framing transitions dynamically from a medium shot to a close-up that captures her head and upper torso. The shot ends with her positioned in the center-left of the frame, while the blurred trees remain in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the entire sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
