  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured from a first-person perspective, depicting an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist, and expansive interior reminiscent of a liminal space. The video begins with a wide shot of a minimalist interior, featuring a dark, textured wall on the left side of the frame and another visible in the middle ground on the right. The upper walls and ceiling are covered in small, glossy white tiles, with two lights at the top framing the scene. The floor at the bottom is composed of a geometric pattern of white and black tiles, with a black path leading from the foreground toward an arched doorway in the center background. The scene is illuminated by a light source that casts a sterile, slightly greenish glow, creating a dreamlike and eerie ambiance. The camera, captured from a smooth, eye-level perspective in a 3D game, moves continuously forward and to the left, exhibiting consistent vertical movements, suggesting it is being held by someone walking. As the camera glides forward, moving through the space and following the black tiled path, it pans slightly to the right, keeping an arched doorway in view. The walls on the left and right expand to fill the periphery of the frame, and the arched doorway in the background grows larger, becoming the central focus. Midway through, the camera pans slightly to the right, focusing on the arched doorway leading into a dark, unlit area in the distance. The shot features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, ensuring the entire environment remains sharp. The focus is on the environment and its unsettling atmosphere rather than a specific subject, with the arched doorway leading into an unknown space in the distance.",

    "Camera": "This first-person POV video, captured from a smooth, eye-level perspective in a 3D game, moves continuously forward and to the left. The camera exhibits consistent vertical movements, suggesting it is being held by someone walking. Midway through, the camera pans slightly to the right, keeping an arched doorway in view. The shot features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, ensuring the entire environment remains sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a sterile, minimalist, and expansive interior reminiscent of a liminal space. The focus is on the environment and its unsettling atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The camera glides through a space defined by a stark contrast of textures: the lower half of the walls features a dark, mottled, concrete-like surface, while the upper walls and ceiling are covered in small, glossy white tiles. The floor is a geometric pattern of white and black tiles. The scene is illuminated by a light source that casts a sterile, slightly greenish glow, creating a dreamlike and eerie ambiance, which is further emphasized by a dark, arched doorway leading into an unknown space in the distance.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a forward-moving camera shot that then pans to the right, focusing on an arched doorway. The scene depicts a room with a mix of white tiled surfaces and grey, textured walls. The area is illuminated by ambient lighting, enhancing the architectural features.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a stark, minimalist indoor space. The room features walls with a lower section of dark, textured material and an upper section of small white tiles that extend across the ceiling. The floor is also covered in white tiles, with a path and a larger section of black tiles leading forward. In the distance, a narrow, arched doorway opens into a dark, unlit area. The scene is bathed in a sterile, slightly greenish glow that permeates the environment.",
    "Spatial": "This is a scenery shot captured from a first-person perspective. The video begins with a wide shot of a minimalist interior. A dark, textured wall occupies the left side of the frame, while another is visible in the middle ground on the right. The upper walls and ceiling, featuring white tiles and two lights at the top, frame the scene. The floor at the bottom is composed of white and black tiles, with a black path leading from the foreground toward an arched doorway in the center background. The camera then glides forward, moving through the space and following the black tiled path. As it advances, the walls on the left and right expand to fill the periphery of the frame, and the arched doorway in the background grows larger, becoming the central focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
