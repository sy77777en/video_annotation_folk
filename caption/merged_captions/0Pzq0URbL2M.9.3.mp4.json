  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, showcasing a vast, dark expanse with a small and circular pit slightly left of center. Two individuals in white shirts appear near the pit's edge. The camera is positioned at an aerial level, providing a bird's-eye view looking down from above, using deep focus with a large depth of field. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide view, bringing the subjects more into focus while they shift to the center of the frame. The camera moves smoothly and swiftly downward, centering on two people leaning toward a hole with their hands resting on its edge, while rolling clockwise. The individuals are seen leaning over the well, looking down into it, and remain stationary. The camera continues to zoom in, providing a clearer view of the individuals and the well's edge. The minimalistic scene, with its dark surroundings and earthy textures, emphasizes the central action. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. Most of the scene is quite dark, with only the central area being slightly illuminated. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner displaying \"[8,12],\" which is not part of the scene itself. The camera maintains a consistent bird's-eye view, flattening spatial depth and keeping the pit as the focal point.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an aerial level, providing a bird's-eye view looking down from above. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly and swiftly downward, centering on two people leaning toward a hole with their hands resting on its edge, while rolling clockwise. The movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two individuals, both wearing white shirts, viewed from above. They are leaning over what appears to be the edge of a well, looking downward. ",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a dark well in the center of the frame, surrounded by a black background. As the camera moves closer, the well becomes more defined, revealing two individuals wearing white clothing at the edge. The individuals are seen leaning over the well, looking down into it, and remain stationary. The camera continues to zoom in, providing a clearer view of the individuals and the well's edge.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an outdoor setting viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a circular pit or well in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. The scene features two people in white clothing leaning over the edge of the pit. Most of the scene is quite dark, with only the central area being slightly illuminated. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner displaying \"[8,12],\" which is not part of the scene itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
