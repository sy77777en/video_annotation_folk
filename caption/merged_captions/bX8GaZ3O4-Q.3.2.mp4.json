  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a view of a shattered, blue, crystalline surface extending from the foreground to the middle ground, filling the frame. A circular opening is positioned in the center of this surface, acting as a middle ground element that reveals a lighter blue, slightly blurred background. The crystalline surface around the hole reflects an external light source, such as moonlight, casting a blue glow that highlights its fractured texture. The camera is static, maintaining a worm's-eye view, and employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on a yellow-orange frog with large, dark eyes and slender limbs as it appears from the bottom of the frame. The frog's skin has a slightly mottled texture, and its limbs are splayed as it navigates the opening. The frog moves towards the center of the hole, eventually reaching it and looking directly into it. As the frog moves inside the opening, it shifts downward within the frame, its body gradually moving downward into the hole.",

    "Camera": "The camera is static, maintaining a worm's-eye view. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on a frog as it appears in the midground through a hole.",
    "Subject": "A yellow-orange frog with large, dark eyes and slender limbs emerges through a circular opening in a shattered, blue, crystalline surface, moving towards the inside of the opening. The frog's skin has a slightly mottled texture, and its limbs are splayed as it navigates the opening.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of a circular hole in a shattered, blue, crystalline surface, with the hole glowing with a blue light. A frog with yellow-orange skin and large, dark eyes appears from the bottom of the frame, moving towards the hole. The frog continues to move closer, eventually reaching the center of the hole and looking directly into it. The frog then starts to descend into the hole, its body gradually moving downward.",
    "Scene": "A circular opening, framed by jagged, radiating shards of a translucent, blue, crystalline material, reveals a lighter blue, slightly blurred background. The crystalline surface around the hole reflects an external light source, such as moonlight, casting a blue glow that highlights its fractured texture. A small, yellowish-orange frog with large, dark eyes emerges through the opening.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a view of a shattered, blue, crystalline surface extending from the foreground to the middle ground, filling the frame. A circular opening is positioned in the center of this surface, acting as a middle ground element that reveals a lighter blue, slightly blurred background. A yellow-orange frog appears from the bottom of the frame, moving to the center at the opening in the middle ground. As the frog moves inside the opening, it shifts downward within the frame. The camera is positioned below the frog."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
