  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a young man with short, bleached blonde hair and black-rimmed glasses, positioned in the center of the frame against a textured, light-gray wall in the background. He is dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black socks, holding a light blue and black racket in his right hand. The camera, from an eye-level position, smoothly tilts down and pans left, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals the man's torso and the racket. As the camera continues to tilt downward, the man sways slightly and takes a couple of steps to his right. The shot concludes with a close-up focused on his lower legs and feet, which are in black athletic shoes with white and orange details, now positioned in the center-right of the frame. His tanned skin and a visible scar on his right shin are noticeable. The wooden floor, marked by two red lines, occupies the foreground and middle ground, while the textured wall remains in the background. The scene is set inside a brightly lit squash court, and the camera movement transitions from a level to a high-angle perspective, looking down at the player's shoes on the court. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the player and the background wall sharp.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level position, the camera smoothly tilts down and pans left, following the squash player's body from their torso down to their feet. This movement transitions the camera from a level to a high-angle perspective, looking down at the player's shoes on the court. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the player and the background wall sharp.",
    "Subject": "A young man with short, bleached blonde hair and black-rimmed glasses stands looking down. He is dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black socks. In his right hand, he holds a light blue and black racket. His attire is revealed from top to bottom, ending on his lower legs and feet, which are in black athletic shoes with white and orange details. He has tanned skin and a visible scar on his right shin.",
    "Motion": "The young man stands on a court, holding a racket, swaying slightly and taking a couple of steps to his right.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a brightly lit squash court with a light-colored wooden floor marked by two red lines. A textured, light-gray wall serves as the backdrop. A person holding a squash racket stands on the court, and the view tilts downward from their upper body to their feet, which are positioned on the wooden surface near the red lines.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a person positioned in the center of the frame, set against a textured wall in the background. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals the person's torso, shorts, and a racket held in their right hand. The tilt continues, concluding with a close-up focused on the person's lower legs and shoes, which are now positioned in the center-right of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
