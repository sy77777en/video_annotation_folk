  "merged_caption": "Initially, the video presents a full shot of a large black limousine positioned in the center of the middle ground, moving towards the right. The limousine is characterized by its sleek design, shiny exterior, and tinted windows, with an American flag and another flag on its front fenders, and a distinctive emblem on the side, indicating its official or ceremonial use. Buildings with large glass windows form the background, while the road occupies the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It follows the limousine as it moves forward, capturing its smooth motion and the details of its design. As the camera moves right, tracking the limousine, it pans smoothly to the right, and the limousine moves across the frame, eventually exiting from the left of the frame. Following this, a black SUV enters the frame from the right, also in a full shot and occupying the middle ground. The SUV has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. It is equipped with a red emergency light bar on its roof, and its rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. The camera continues its rightward movement, tracking the SUV as it moves from the left towards the right side of the frame, maintaining a steady pace ahead of the limousine. The urban background and road remain consistent throughout the sequence, and the camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking. Both vehicles are depicted in motion within this urban environment, indicating a convoy or procession.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves quickly from left to right, smoothly panning in the middle to shift focus from the car behind to the one in front. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its sleek design and shiny exterior. It has an American flag mounted on the front, indicating its official or ceremonial use. The limousine's windows are tinted, and it bears a distinctive emblem on the side, suggesting a high level of importance or security. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. The SUV's rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating a convoy or procession.",
    "Motion": "A large black limousine with an American flag and another flag on its front is driving on a city street, passing by modern buildings with glass facades. The camera follows the limousine as it moves forward, capturing its smooth motion and the details of its design. As the camera pans to the right, a black SUV with roof-mounted equipment comes into view, positioned in front of the limousine. The SUV's rear lights are illuminated, and it maintains a steady pace ahead of the limousine.",
    "Scene": "The video is set on a paved city street during daylight hours, bordered by modern buildings featuring large glass windows. A long, black limousine, distinguished by US and Presidential flags on its front fenders and a seal on the rear door, is shown driving along the road. Following this, a black SUV, equipped with a red emergency light bar on its roof, travels down the same street. Both vehicles are depicted in motion within this urban environment.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, the video presents a full shot of a black limousine positioned in the center of the middle ground, moving towards the right. Buildings form the background, while the road occupies the foreground and middle ground. The camera moves right, tracking the limousine. As the camera then pans right, the limousine moves across the frame and eventually exits from the left of the frame. Following this, a black SUV enters the frame from the right, also in a full shot and occupying the middle ground. The camera continues its rightward movement, tracking the SUV as it moves from the left towards the right side of the frame. The urban background and road remain consistent. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a position level with both vehicles."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
