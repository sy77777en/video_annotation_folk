  "merged_caption": "This scenery video opens with an extreme wide shot of the Berlin Cathedral, a large stone edifice centrally positioned in the middle ground, extending from the bottom towards the top, with its main dome in the upper-center and a tower to its right. A scaffolding-covered tower is located in the left-center of the frame, also in the middle ground. Green treetops are visible in the middle ground across the bottom edge. Initially, a person riding a bicycle is positioned in the center of the foreground at the bottom of the frame, and a grassy area extends from the foreground into the middle ground, also at the bottom of the frame. The bright blue sky with scattered white clouds occupies the background in the upper portion of the frame. The camera starts at eye-level and a level angle, rolling clockwise and swiftly moving forward along a path while keeping the cross at the top of the building's exterior wall centered. As the camera quickly moves forward, the frame narrows to show only the tops of some green trees in the foreground and the upper half of the cathedral in the midground. In this closer framing, the upper half of the cathedral fills the middle ground, its main dome now positioned in the top right corner, while the tops of the foreground trees are visible at the bottom. The sky and clouds continue to form the background. The camera transitions swiftly from a level angle to a low angle, looking upwards at the cathedral at the end of the shot, maintaining a Dutch angle that varies due to the rolling motion. The movement is smooth and quick, with deep focus and a large depth of field.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video features a camera that starts at eye-level and a level angle, rolling clockwise and swiftly moving forward along a path while keeping the cross at the top of the building's exterior wall centered. The camera transitions to a low angle and maintains a Dutch angle that varies due to the rolling motion. The movement is smooth and quick, with deep focus and a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "This cityscape scenery shot features a grand, historic building, likely a cathedral, with a large central dome and smaller towers, set against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. As the camera smoothly advances forward, a cyclist can be seen riding in the opposite direction, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The focus is on the architectural details and the overall impression of the structure within its urban context, emphasizing the environment, scale, and movement.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a large, ornate building, likely a cathedral, against a blue sky with some clouds. There is no discernible subject motion.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures the Berlin Cathedral, a grand, stone edifice with a prominent, green, copper-clad dome topped by a golden cross. Smaller towers with similar green domes flank the central structure, which is adorned with statues and intricate carvings. To the left of the cathedral, a tower is partially covered in blue scaffolding and tarps. At the beginning of the video, a cyclist and a grassy square are visible in the foreground and midground. As the camera quickly moves forward, the frame narrows to show only the tops of some green trees in the foreground and the upper half of the cathedral in the midground. The scene is set against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery video opens with an extreme wide shot.

In this closer framing, the upper half of the cathedral fills the middle ground, its main dome now positioned in the top right corner, while the tops of the foreground trees are visible at the bottom. The sky and clouds continue to form the background. The camera transitions swiftly from a level angle to a low angle, looking upwards at the cathedral at the end of the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
