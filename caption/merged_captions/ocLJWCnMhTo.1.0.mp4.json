  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a man wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and black shoes in the center-bottom of the foreground, with his upper body visible and his legs extending into the middle ground. He is depicted lying flat on his back, suspended above a silver coffee table on a black-and-white checkered floor. His arms are slightly raised and reaching outward, while bright, swirling orange lines of light move erratically around and over his body, extending through the foreground and middle ground. The scene takes place in a room with light-colored, grainy walls, where a light blue rectangular board is against the wall next to a white door, along with two metal chairs and a round table against the back wall. The camera starts from a low angle, hip-level perspective, and executes a smooth crane movement, transitioning from a side view to a bird's-eye, top-down shot. As the camera cranes up in an arc, it maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp throughout the shaky movement. The shot transitions to a bird's-eye view, panoramic shot, where the man is centered on the checkered floor, which serves as a background element. In this final framing, the orange lines continue to move across the entire scene throughout the shot. Black bars overlay the sides of the video, and the video has a grainy, low-resolution quality.",

    "Camera": "Starting from a low angle, hip-level perspective, the unsteady camera cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a bird's-eye view of the person lying flat on a round coffee table, parallel to the ground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp throughout the shaky movement.",
    "Subject": "A man wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and black shoes is depicted suspended above a coffee table on a black-and-white checkered floor. His arms are raised with his hands open. Throughout the grainy video, bright, swirling orange lines of light move erratically around and over his body. The camera's perspective changes, shifting from a side view to a bird's-eye view of the man.",
    "Motion": "A man lies calmly on his back with his arms slightly raised and reaching outward, as the camera executes a smooth crane movement, transitioning from a side view to a bird's-eye, top-down shot. Throughout the scene, bright orange lines of light continuously and erratically swirl around and over his body.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a room with a black and white checkered tile floor and light-colored, grainy walls. A person wearing a light-colored shirt is lying flat on their back, suspended above a silver coffee table in the center of the room. In the background, there is a light blue rectangular board against the wall next to a white door, along with two metal chairs and a round table against the back wall. The camera angle shifts from a straight-on view to a bird's eye angle, top-down perspective. Black bars overlay the sides of the video, and the video has a grainy, low-resolution quality.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a man in the center-bottom of the foreground, with his upper body visible and his legs extending into the middle ground. Swirling orange lines of light move through the foreground and middle ground, while the room's walls and a door are visible in the background. The camera then executes a crane movement, smoothly rising from a side position to a top-down view above the subject, transitioning to a bird's-eye view, panoramic shot. In this final framing, the man is centered on the checkered floor, which serves as a background element, while the orange lines continue to move across the entire scene throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
