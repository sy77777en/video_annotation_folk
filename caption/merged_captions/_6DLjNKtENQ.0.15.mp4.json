  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot inside the cockpit of a helicopter during the daytime. A dark-skinned woman with long, dark, wavy hair is positioned in the center middle ground of the frame, initially facing towards the left side of the frame. She wears a dark textured jacket over a lighter top and a headset with a microphone, speaking continuously while her right hand rests on a control device. A partially visible light-skinned man, seen mostly from the side and back of his head, is situated in the right foreground, also facing towards the left. He has a visible tattoo on his neck/shoulder area and wears a light-colored t-shirt and a headset with a microphone. The camera is at a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with focus on the people in the midground. Fixed inside the helicopter, the camera trucks left to side-track the people, exhibiting slightly unsteady movement with some shaking. As the woman turns her head to her left, directing her gaze towards the man, her eyes widen, and her mouth slightly opens, suggesting she has stopped speaking. The man, initially facing forward toward the left side of the frame, slightly turns right to look at the woman as she turns to him. In the mid-ground behind the woman, a helicopter window is visible, through which a blurred mid-air cityscape with light-colored buildings forms the background, suggesting an urban environment or sky. The overall impression is of an active flight.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with focus on the people in the midground. Fixed inside a helicopter, the camera trucks left to side-track the people, exhibiting slightly unsteady movement with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "A dark-skinned woman with long, dark, wavy hair is seated in a helicopter seat, facing the left side of the frame. She wears a dark textured jacket over a lighter top and a headset with a microphone, speaking continuously while her right hand rests on a control device. Initially, she is facing the left side of the frame, then turns left towards the camera, her eyes widening and mouth opening slightly as she looks at a partially visible light-skinned man on the right side of the frame. The man, seen mostly from the side and back of his head, has a visible tattoo on his neck/shoulder area and wears a light-colored t-shirt and a headset with a microphone. He is seated to her left.",
    "Motion": "The woman, wearing a headset, is seated in the co-pilot seat of a helicopter, with her right hand on the control device. She is initially looking forward toward the left of the frame and speaking. As she turns her head to the left to look at the light-skinned man seated beside her, her eyes widen, and her mouth slightly opens, suggesting she has stopped speaking. The man, also wearing a headset and with a tattoo on his neck, is seated in the pilot seat. Initially facing forward toward the left side of the frame, he slightly turns right to look at the woman as she turns to him. The background outside the helicopter shows a cityscape with tall buildings.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside the cockpit of a helicopter during the daytime. The interior is moderately lit, with visible structural elements of the aircraft. Two individuals are present, both wearing headsets with microphones. The person on the left, a woman with dark hair, wears a dark, textured jacket. The person on the right, partially visible, wears a light-colored shirt. Through the cockpit windows, a blurry, light-colored background is discernible, suggesting an urban environment or sky. The overall impression is of an active flight.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium close-up shot. A woman is positioned in the center middle ground of the frame, initially facing towards the left side of the frame. A partially visible man is situated in the right foreground, also facing towards the left. The woman then turns her head to her left, directing her gaze towards the man. In the mid-ground behind the woman, a helicopter window is visible, through which a blurred mid-air cityscape with light-colored buildings forms the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
