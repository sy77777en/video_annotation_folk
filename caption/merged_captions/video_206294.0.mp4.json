  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a herd of approximately a dozen horses slightly below the center of the frame. The horses display a variety of coat colors, including several shades of brown from light tan and chestnut to dark brown, along with at least one grey or white horse. They run as a group across a vast, snow-covered plain that fills the lower and central areas of the scene. As they gallop from left to right, their hooves kick up clouds of powdery snow. In the background, a range of large, snow-covered mountains extends across the upper portion of the frame under a bright, hazy sky. From a smooth, overhead aerial view, the camera tracks the herd's movement across the landscape, gliding forward and to the right while panning left to keep the animals centered in the frame. A deep focus keeps both the horses and the distant mountains sharp, capturing the dynamic motion of the herd as they move cohesively across the open terrain. The expansive landscape, blanketed in white snow, provides a striking contrast to the varied colors of the horses, including the notable presence of a striking white horse among them. The camera's tracking movement ensures that the herd remains slightly below the center of the frame, maintaining a clear view of the scene's vastness and the majestic backdrop of the snow-covered mountains.",

    "Subject": "A herd of approximately a dozen horses runs together. The horses display a variety of coat colors, including several shades of brown from light tan and chestnut to dark brown, along with at least one grey or white horse. They are all in a running posture, moving as a cohesive group.",
    "Motion": "A herd of horses gallops across a wide, snow-covered plain, moving from left to right. As they run together in a cohesive group, their hooves kick up clouds of snow. In the background, a range of snow-covered mountains stands against a bright sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a herd of horses, including a striking white horse among them, galloping across a vast, snow-covered plain during the daytime. The expansive landscape is blanketed in white snow, with a range of large, rugged mountains, also covered in snow, visible in the background under a bright, hazy sky. The horses, varying in shades of brown, black, and white, move as a group across the open terrain, kicking up powdery snow as they run.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
