  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium full shot of a person with a light skin tone and short, slightly wavy reddish-brown hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, standing outdoors in front of a house with yellow siding and large, reflective windows. The subject, positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, faces to the left, holding a black book or folder under their right arm. Their reflection is visible in the glass window, which extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the left side of the frame. The subject remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining an upright posture and looking straight ahead with a smile. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing their body from the knees up, and is quite unsteady, moving without a clear pattern. The background includes the house's yellow siding and grid-patterned glass windows, which remain static. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the warm, natural lighting casting soft shadows. The presence of strong sunlight suggests it is a clear, sunny day, and the overall atmosphere is serene, with the architecture and lighting creating a harmonious visual composition. There are no changes in shot size, position, or camera height during the video. The spatial framing consistently places the subject in the middle ground, with the house forming the backdrop. The camera maintains deep focus and a large depth of field, capturing the serene environment and the subject's focused posture as they stand facing the glass door.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
