  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, level-angle scenery shot of a town street at night, focusing on the environment rather than specific subjects. In the foreground, a large, vertical pink neon sign is positioned on the left side of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by the main street and its buildings, which are adorned with numerous neon signs, including a red arrow sign in the center-left and a green \"EAT\" sign in the center-right. A red fire truck is initially positioned in the right middle ground, driving away from the camera. A small car enters from the left in the middle ground, emerging from behind the signs and moving toward the camera on the left side of the road, while two classic cars enter from the bottom right and proceed to follow the fire truck down the street. In the background, the dark silhouette of hills is visible. The camera moves downward while tilting up and trucking slightly to the right, unveiling a vibrant, neon-lit street scene reminiscent of Radiator Springs from the movie 'Cars'. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street sharp. The scene is dominated by glowing advertisements, including a tall, vertical pink sign for \"Mrs. MUFFLE,\" although the last character(s) are not very clear, a red arrow-shaped sign with yellow bulbs for \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" a green vertical sign that reads \"EAT,\" and a blue sign for \"WIMPY'S.\" The lively atmosphere is created by the colorful glow of neon signs against the dark desert night, with the red fire truck and other vehicles moving slowly down the main street of this stylized, retro town, contributing to the bustling yet nostalgic ambiance of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
