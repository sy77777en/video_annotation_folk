  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a solid blue human figure, seen from the back and appearing to wear a shirt with visible folds, is positioned in the right foreground with its back to the camera. The blue figure's chest and arms exhibit subtle movements, suggesting a breathing motion. In the middle ground, a black vehicle with a glossy finish and bright, linear highlights along its roof and window frame occupies the left and center of the frame. Through the car's side window, the profile of a solid red human figure, rendered with discernible facial features such as a nose and mouth, is visible in the center-left of the frame, sitting in the driver's seat in profile and facing left. The red figure appears to be wearing a shirt with a crew neck collar and sits still inside the stationary car. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level in an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the car in the midground in focus. The camera moves smoothly and slowly, arcing clockwise around the car while subtly moving downward and tilting upward to maintain focus on the red figure in the driver's seat. The setting is dimly lit, and a \"[2]\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner of the screen.",

    "Subject": "A solid blue human figure, seen from the back, stands in the foreground, appearing to wear a shirt with visible folds. Through the window of a black car, a second human figure, rendered in solid red, is visible sitting in the driver's seat. The red figure is shown in profile, facing towards the left, and appears to be wearing a shirt with a crew neck collar. The red figure also has discernible facial features, such as a nose and mouth.",
    "Motion": "The blue figure's chest and arms exhibit subtle movements, suggesting a breathing motion, while the red figure sits still inside the stationary car.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit setting, a blue, featureless figure stands in the foreground with its back to the viewer, partially obscuring a black vehicle. Through the car's side window, the profile of a red, featureless figure can be seen in the driver's seat. The vehicle has a glossy black finish with bright, linear highlights along its roof and window frame. A \"[2]\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a blue figure is positioned in the right foreground with its back to the camera. In the middle ground, a black car occupies the left and center of the frame. Through the car's window, a red figure is visible in the center-left of the frame, also in the middle ground, sitting in profile and facing left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
