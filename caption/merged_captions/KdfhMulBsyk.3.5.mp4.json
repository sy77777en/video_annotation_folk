  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man's face, initially positioned in the center of the frame. The man, with light-colored hair that appears white or blonde, is shown looking down and to the side, with his head tilted toward the bottom left. His hair falls across his forehead, contrasting with his noticeably darker eyebrows and beard. He is wearing a white collared shirt that appears to glow a bright cyan color due to the distinctive blue lighting. The scene is illuminated by a strong blue light, casting his face in deep shadow while highlighting his features. A bright cyan light source from the right side of the frame illuminates the collar of his shirt and casts a glow on his hair and the side of his face, creating a strong contrast with the surrounding blue tones. As the shot progresses, the man slowly turns his head slightly to his right while looking up, shifting to the center-left of the frame. He occupies the foreground against a dark, indistinct background. Throughout the shot, his head moves slightly. The camera is positioned at his level, using a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man's face in the foreground before it goes out of focus. The camera movement is smooth, but its specific motion is unclear due to the lack of background.",

    "Scene": "A close-up shot is bathed in a deep blue light against a dark, indistinct background. A person's face is partially visible, looking downward. A bright cyan light source from the right side of the frame illuminates the collar of their shirt and casts a glow on their hair and the side of their face, creating a strong contrast with the surrounding blue tones. The person's head moves slightly throughout the shot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
