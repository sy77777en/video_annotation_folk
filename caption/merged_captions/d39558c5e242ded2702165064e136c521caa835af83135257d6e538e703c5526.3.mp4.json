  "merged_caption": "This video opens with a medium shot, positioning an East Asian boy with short black hair and clear safety goggles left of center in the middle ground and a Caucasian girl with blonde hair and fair skin to his right. The boy, wearing a white, short-sleeved, button-up shirt covered in black cursive writing and a white disposable glove on his right hand, holds a glass volumetric flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, which he lifts and gently swirls. The girl, dressed in a blue and white plaid shirt, sits still, resting her chin on her left hand while looking down at an open book and holding a pencil in her right hand. In the foreground, a table displays a large red flask on the bottom left, a small bottle of pink dye near the center, and an open book on the right. The background features a chalkboard on the left, a skeleton model in the center-right, and a cactus on the far right. The scene takes place in a brightly lit indoor room set up like a science classroom. As the boy continues to examine the flask, the camera uses a slightly unsteady forward dolly, simultaneously tilting up and ascending to close in on the boy's face, transitioning the perspective from a level to a low angle. This movement shifts the framing to a medium close-up that captures the boy from the chest up, placing him centrally in the shot while the girl on the right is pushed mostly out of view. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the movement, maintaining a shallow depth of field to keep the boy in focus as he observes the liquid intently.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the boy in the midground in focus. The camera performs a slightly unsteady forward dolly, simultaneously tilting up and ascending to close in on the boy's face, which transitions the perspective from a level to a low angle.",
    "Subject": "An East Asian boy and a Caucasian girl are shown at a table. The boy, standing and positioned slightly to the left of center, has short black hair and wears clear safety goggles over his eyes. He is dressed in a white, short-sleeved, button-up shirt covered in black cursive writing and has a white disposable glove on his right hand. He holds a glass volumetric flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, which he observes intently before picking it up and shaking it. To his right, a girl with blonde hair and fair skin sits at the table. She is wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and is seen resting her chin on her left hand while looking down at an open book, holding a pencil in her right hand. The scene transitions from a medium shot including both children to a closer view focusing on the boy from the chest up as he continues to inspect the flask.",
    "Motion": "A boy wearing safety goggles and a glove holds a glass flask with pink liquid, then lifts it and gently swirls the contents. To his right, a girl sits still, resting her chin on her hand while looking down at a book. The camera uses a dolly movement to move in closer for a better view of the boy as he continues to swirl the flask and observe the liquid.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a brightly lit indoor room set up like a science classroom. The background features a white wall adorned with a model of a human skeleton, various scientific diagrams, yellow sticky notes, and a tall green cactus. To the left, a black chalkboard rests on an easel. In the foreground, a white table is arranged with chemistry equipment, including a large, round-bottom glass flask containing a red liquid, a small bottle of pink dye, an open book, and a glass of water. A boy wearing safety goggles stands at the table, holding and swirling a glass conical flask filled with a vibrant pink liquid. To the right of the boy, a little girl with her hand resting on her cheek holds a pen and reads a book. The camera uses a dolly movement to move in, focusing on the boy and the flask he is examining.",
    "Spatial": "This video opens with a medium shot, positioning a boy left of center in the middle ground and a girl to his right. In the foreground, a table displays a large red flask on the bottom left, a small bottle of pink dye near the center, and an open book on the right. The background features a chalkboard on the left, a skeleton model in the center-right, and a cactus on the far right. As the boy lifts and examines a flask of pink liquid, the camera moves forward and tilts upward, transitioning to a medium close-up that frames him from the chest up and places him centrally in the shot, while the girl on the right is pushed mostly out of view. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
