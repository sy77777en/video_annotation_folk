  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire red panda as it moves through the scene. Initially, the red panda, with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and black legs, is positioned in the bottom left quadrant of the frame, walking on all fours across the grass parallel to a horizontal log that extends from the top left to the top right in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field to keep all elements sharp. Several dark metal poles and a small wooden climbing structure with steps facing the right side of the frame are centrally located in the middle ground. The background consists of green shrubs, patches of bare earth, and stone paths, filling the upper and right portions of the frame. As the red panda, marked with white patches around the eyes and muzzle and upright, pointed ears, moves toward the center, it steps onto a white stair and circles around a pillar before climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. The camera smoothly tracks the red panda, initially panning left and tilting down as the panda moves, then briefly pausing before tilting up and slightly panning right to continue following the red panda. The red panda moves along the branch, using its elongated body and tail for balance as it explores the area. The environment is a well-maintained, enclosed garden area with lush green grass and a variety of low shrubs and plants, bordered by stone paths and landscaped features, creating a naturalistic yet organized appearance. A glass barrier is visible in the foreground. The camera remains above the subjects throughout, providing a clear top-down perspective of the red panda’s movement and the spatial arrangement of the garden elements.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly tracks the red panda, initially panning left and tilting down as the panda moves, then briefly pausing before tilting up and slightly panning right to continue following the red panda. Camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and black legs. The red panda moves on all fours, occasionally climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. Its face is marked with white patches around the eyes and muzzle, and its ears are upright and pointed. The animal’s body is elongated and its tail is held out behind it as it navigates the area. The red panda’s movements are agile and deliberate as it explores its environment.",
    "Motion": "The red panda walks on all fours across the grass, then steps onto a white stair and circles around a pillar before climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. It moves along the branch, using its tail for balance as it explores the area.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a well-maintained, enclosed garden area with lush green grass, patches of bare earth, and a variety of low shrubs and plants. Several dark metal poles and a small climbing structure with wooden steps are positioned near the center, while a large, smooth, light-colored log lies horizontally across the ground, partially surrounded by vegetation. The setting is bright, indicating daytime with clear weather. A reddish-brown animal with a bushy tail moves through the scene, walking across the grass and interacting with the log and climbing structure. The environment is bordered by stone paths and landscaped features, creating a naturalistic yet organized appearance. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire red panda as it moves through the scene. Initially, the red panda is positioned in the bottom left quadrant of the frame, walking on the grass parallel to a horizontal log that extends from the top left to the top right in the middle ground. Several dark metal poles and a small wooden climbing structure are centrally located in the middle ground, with the climbing steps facing the right side of the frame. The background consists of green shrubs, patches of bare earth, and stone paths, filling the upper and right portions of the frame. As the red panda moves toward the center, it partially climbs onto the horizontal log, remaining in the middle ground near the central area of the frame. A glass barrier is visible in the foreground. The camera remains above the subjects throughout, providing a clear top-down perspective of the red panda’s movement and the spatial arrangement of the garden elements. No significant camera movement occurs, and the spatial relationships between the red panda, the climbing structure, and the log remain consistent as the animal transitions within the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
