  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot centered on a person's lower legs and feet in the foreground. A red line on the light-colored wooden floor runs diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, passing beneath their feet. The person, who has a light skin tone, is wearing white sneakers and white socks. A green racket and a small, dark ball briefly enter the bottom center of the frame as the ball is bounced on the floor. The scene takes place inside a squash court with white, textured walls, featuring additional red lines at different heights and yellow sections at the bottom corners. The camera then smoothly tilts upward, transitioning to a medium close-up that frames the person from the chest up. In this final composition, the subject is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the foreground, with a white, textured wall occupying the background. A red line is visible along the wall in the top left corner of the frame. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the subject in focus throughout the movement. The upward tilt reveals a young man with dark, wavy hair that falls over his forehead. He is wearing a dark blue t-shirt, blue-gray shorts, wristbands on both wrists, and clear protective glasses. The young man stands in place, looking down at the moving ball.",

    "Subject": "The video initially shows the lower legs and feet of a person standing on a wooden court. This person, who has a light skin tone, is wearing white sneakers and white socks. A green racket is used to bounce a small, dark ball on the floor. The view then tilts upward to reveal a young man with dark, wavy hair that falls over his forehead. He is wearing a dark blue t-shirt, blue-gray shorts, wristbands on both wrists, and clear protective glasses, and he is looking down.",
    "Motion": "A young man stands in place, bouncing a small, dark ball on the wooden floor of a court. The camera then tilts upward, revealing him looking down at the moving ball.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a squash court featuring a light-colored wooden floor and white, textured walls. Red lines are painted across the floorboards, indicating specific areas of the court, and additional red lines are visible on the walls at different heights. Yellow sections are located at the bottom corners of the court. A person wearing white sneakers, white socks, and a dark t-shirt stands on the court. The perspective begins with a high-angle view of the person's feet positioned near the red line before tilting upward to reveal their upper body and head.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
