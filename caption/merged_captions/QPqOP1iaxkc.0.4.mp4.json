  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring a man and a woman seated on a bench, positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center in the bottom half of the frame. The man, on the left, wears a dark jacket and is gesturing with his hands, suggesting communication, while the woman, on the right, wears a dark coat and a light-colored beanie or hat, using her phone. They are sitting close together. Rocks are visible along the bottom edge, also in the foreground. A body of water occupies the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the center of the frame, with a bright sun reflection prominent on its left side. In the background, a bridge extends from the top left towards the center, while the New York City skyline is visible across the center and right side along the horizon, prominently featuring the Williamsburg Bridge to the left and the spire of One World Trade Center. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing the scene with a deep focus and large depth of field. There is smooth, minor camera movement, consisting of a slight pan from right to left. The video captures an outdoor scene along a waterfront during a bright afternoon approaching sunset, under sunny, clear skies. The intense reflection of bright sunlight on the river's surface creates shimmering ripples that dance across the water. The sun is low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, with slight movement observed throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing the scene with a deep focus and large depth of field. There is smooth, minor camera movement, consisting of a slight pan from right to left.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a man and a woman sitting slightly left of center on a park bench, facing away from the viewer. They are looking out over a body of water towards a city skyline and a bridge in the distance, silhouetted against the bright, low sun. The man, on the left, wears a dark jacket and is gesturing with his hands, suggesting communication. The woman, on the right, wears a dark coat and a light-colored beanie or hat. They are sitting close together.",
    "Motion": "A man and a woman are sitting on a bench by the water, with a city skyline and a bridge in the background. The man is gesturing with his hands, as if engaging in conversation with the woman next to him, while she is using her phone. The sun is low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the scene.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene along a waterfront during a bright afternoon approaching sunset, under sunny, clear skies. Two silhouetted figures are seated on a dark bench positioned on a paved area near the water's edge, which is lined with large rocks. Across the wide expanse of water, the New York City skyline is visible in the distance, prominently featuring the Williamsburg Bridge to the left and the spire of One World Trade Center. The intense reflection of bright sunlight on the river's surface creates shimmering ripples that dance across the water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
