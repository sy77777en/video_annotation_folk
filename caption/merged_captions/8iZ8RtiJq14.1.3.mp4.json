  "merged_caption": "A high-angle full shot frames a beige, vintage-style digital office telephone and a silver-colored metal ashtray on a wooden surface. The phone, featuring a numeric keypad, several function buttons, a coiled cord connecting the handset to the base, and a small, green-backlit LCD screen displaying the vertical text \"CALL 95242046,\" is centered in the frame and becomes more prominent as the camera moves forward. The camera, from a high, Dutch angle, steadily moves forward and rolls counterclockwise, approaching the landline phone and the ashtray prominently positioned in the foreground. Initially, both the phone and the ashtray, which holds a single cigarette with a yellow filter in one of its notches, are in focus. The ashtray is located in the bottom right corner and initially appears partially visible but gradually disappears from view as the camera advances. As the camera moves forward, the focus shifts, leaving only the phone in the frame. The entire scene is captured from a tilted overhead perspective, presenting a static shot with no discernible movement from any object in the frame.",

    "Motion": "The video presents a static shot of a telephone and an ashtray on a wooden surface, with no discernible movement from any object in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A beige, vintage-style digital office phone sits on a wooden desk. The phone features a numeric keypad, several function buttons, and a coiled cord connecting the handset to the base. A small, green-backlit screen on the phone horizontally displays the word \"CALL\" next to the number \"95242046\". To the right of the phone, a silver metal ashtray holds a single cigarette with a yellow filter.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
