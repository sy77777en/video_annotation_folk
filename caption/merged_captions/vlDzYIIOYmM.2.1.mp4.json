  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a light-skinned woman with brown hair tied back is positioned in the center of the frame, standing barefoot on a white surfboard that occupies the bottom-center and bottom-right foreground. She is wearing a yellow two-piece bikini and balances with her arms extended and knees bent. To her left, a large, dark blue wave spans from the foreground to the middle ground, its crest breaking into white foam and spray against a bright, cloudy sky. Initially, a distant, green, tree-lined shore is visible in the upper-center-left background. However, this view goes out of frame later in the video as the camera shifts. The video is presented with a speed ramp effect, shifting from regular speed to fast motion. Shot from a level, above-water perspective, the frame has a fixed Dutch angle and mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The slightly unsteady camera tracks the surfer from the front, arcing clockwise and panning to follow her as she rides the wave. As she moves forward, the wave curls and crashes over her, engulfing her in a large splash of water that fills the center and right of the frame, temporarily obscuring her from view. The perspective remains fixed to the board as it glides across the water's surface, with the curling wave eventually enveloping the woman on the surfboard in a rush of white water. The camera, mounted at the subject's level on the surfboard, moves with the woman's actions as the water moves into the immediate foreground. The white surfboard has a black sticker or marking visible near her front foot.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned woman with brown hair tied back is shown surfing on a white surfboard. She is wearing a yellow two-piece bikini. She stands barefoot on the board, bending her knees and extending her arms out to her sides for balance. As she rides, she is briefly engulfed by a large splash of water from the curling wave. The white surfboard has a black sticker or marking visible near her front foot.",
    "Motion": "A woman rides a wave on a surfboard, balancing with her arms extended and knees bent. As she moves forward, the wave curls and crashes over her, engulfing her in a large splash of water.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a white surfboard, the scene captures the dynamic environment of ocean surfing. A large, dark blue wave curls powerfully, its crest breaking into white foam and spray against a bright, cloudy sky. Initially, a green, tree-lined shore is visible in the distance but then moves out of the frame as the camera follows the action. The perspective remains fixed to the board as it glides across the water's surface, with the curling wave eventually enveloping the woman on the surfboard in a rush of white water.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a surfboard that occupies the bottom-center and bottom-right foreground. To her left, a large wave spans from the foreground to the middle ground. Initially, a distant, tree-lined shore is visible in the upper-center-left background against a cloudy sky in the top right. However, this view goes out of frame later in the video as the camera shifts. As the video progresses, the wave engulfs the woman in a large splash of water that fills the center and right of the frame, temporarily obscuring her from view. The camera, mounted at the subject's level on the surfboard, moves with the woman's actions as the water moves into the immediate foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
