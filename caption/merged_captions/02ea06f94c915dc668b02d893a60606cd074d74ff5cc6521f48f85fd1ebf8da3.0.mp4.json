  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects in an indoor setting with a neutral, softly lit environment. The woman, positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, has light skin, dark hair pulled back, and visible facial moles. She faces left with a neutral expression, occupying the right half of the frame. The man, in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, has light skin, short dark hair, and wears a light blue shirt. He faces right with a calm expression, occupying the left half of the frame. The background is a minimal, softly lit wall, possibly white or cream-colored, adding to the serene atmosphere. The focus remains sharp on the woman's profile while the man is slightly blurred, emphasizing the depth and separation between them. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the woman in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. There is noticeable camera shaking throughout the video. The woman stays still while subtly shifting her gaze upwards. Meanwhile, the slightly blurred man in the background starts with his eyes closed but opens them midway through the scene. The lighting is even and natural, suggesting daytime, and the scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a clear and detached observation of the subjects. The overall composition is simple, emphasizing the calm and quiet nature of the setting.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with a neutral, softly lit environment. The focus is on two individuals, with one positioned in front of the other. The person in front is facing left, while the person behind is facing right. The background is minimal, with a light, possibly white or cream-colored wall that adds to the serene atmosphere.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
