  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide-angle, ground-level shot, placing a plush teddy bear in the middle ground, slightly left of the bottom center, on a carpeted floor surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. In the lower left foreground, a blurry carousel ornament is visible. A person, visible only from the waist down and wearing striped clothes, enters from the right side of the frame, moving on their knees into the middle ground. They push an object covered in white fabric toward the center of the frame. The camera, with a shallow depth of field, slowly and smoothly dollies backward, maintaining the subject's level. The person pulls the white sheet, which initially occupies the center middle ground, upward and off-screen to the right, revealing the lower half of a miniature metal Ferris wheel structure. This Ferris wheel, partially illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background, now occupies the center middle ground, positioned directly in front of the bear. The room's decor includes intricate patterns on the walls, contributing to a vintage aesthetic, and the overall ambiance suggests a quiet, reflective moment, with the lighting and arrangement of objects evoking a sense of childhood wonder. The person then exits the frame to the right, leaving the bear toy facing the partially visible Ferris wheel, creating a sense of stillness and contemplation in the dimly lit room with a soft, amber glow.",

    "Camera": "This is a ground-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the toy Ferris wheel in the midground. The camera slowly and smoothly dollies backward, effectively revealing the lower half of the Ferris wheel's structure.",
    "Subject": "The video features a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the scene, visible from the waist down, moving on their knees. They pull a covered rack draped in white fabric into view and lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure. The Ferris wheel is partially illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background, with only the lower half visible. The person then exits the frame, leaving the bear toy facing the partially visible Ferris wheel.",
    "Motion": "A figure, visible only from the waist down, enters from the right, kneeling, and pushes an object covered in white fabric toward the center of the frame. The figure then removes the fabric and retreats out of the frame, revealing the lower half of a miniature metal Ferris wheel. A bear toy sits motionless in front of the stationary structure.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. The scene features a dimly lit room with a soft, amber glow, highlighting a small Ferris wheel model made of metal beams. A plush teddy bear sits on the carpeted floor, facing the Ferris wheel, creating a sense of stillness and contemplation. Scattered around are various toys, including a toy car and a small carousel, adding to the playful yet serene environment. The room's decor includes intricate patterns on the walls, contributing to a vintage aesthetic. The overall ambiance suggests a quiet, reflective moment, with the lighting and arrangement of objects evoking a sense of childhood wonder.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide-angle shot, placing a teddy bear in the middle ground, slightly left of the bottom center. In the lower left foreground, a blurry carousel ornament is visible. A person's lower body, visible from the waist down, enters from the right side of the frame and moves on their knees into the middle ground. They pull a white sheet, which initially occupies the center middle ground, upward and off-screen to the right. This action reveals a large, metal Ferris wheel structure that now occupies the center middle ground, positioned directly in front of the bear. A warm, glowing light in the background is visible through the Ferris wheel's frame. The person then exits the frame to the right. Throughout the scene, the camera slowly moves backwards, maintaining the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
