  "merged_caption": "This video uses a medium full shot, capturing a person in a dark, full-body spacesuit with a helmet from approximately the knees up. The suit has distinct light-colored stripes and padding, suggesting a design for protection or specialized activity. The person is positioned slightly left of the center within the frame and occupies the foreground, oriented with their back to the viewer, slightly leaning forward with arms extended, possibly indicating movement or interaction with the surroundings. As the video progresses, the person smoothly moves backward, giving the impression of floating. Tall, vertical structures are visible on the right side of the frame, extending into the background. Horizontal lines dominate the scene, appearing in the middle ground and extending into the background, stretching across the frame's width. The setting is characterized by vertical and horizontal lines, contributing to a high-tech, industrial atmosphere. The lighting is dim, with reflections on the surfaces, enhancing the sleek and modern aesthetic. The camera is positioned at hip level, looking straight ahead with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the person in the foreground. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness. There are no changes in shot size or the subject's position during the clip. The person has a device mounted on their right forearm.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place in a dark, indoor setting dominated by tall, vertical structures. These structures feature numerous parallel, horizontal lines that appear reflective or illuminated, creating a complex pattern of light and shadow throughout the space. A figure, viewed from behind, stands within this environment. They are wearing a grey and white suit with darker grey or black sections, including a helmet, and have a device mounted on their right forearm.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
