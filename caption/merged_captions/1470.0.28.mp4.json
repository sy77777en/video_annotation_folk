  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a cozy, softly lit bathroom with a vintage aesthetic, capturing all significant elements and subjects. Initially, one individual with medium-length dark hair, dressed in a white shirt and tie, is seated slightly to the left of center in the middle ground within a freestanding bathtub with claw feet, filled with bubbles. This person, who has a bubble beard, gradually stands up, speaking while holding a book in their right hand, remaining in the same position. Another individual with short hair, wearing a pink shower cap, headphones, and cucumber slices on their eyes, lies in the bathtub, positioned slightly to the right in the middle ground, enjoying a bath with their head resting on the edge. Natural light enters from a window located in the upper right of the frame, with blinds and a partially drawn curtain, casting patterned shadows onto the muted tone walls, suggesting the daytime. To the left side of the frame, in the middle ground, there is a hanging bathrobe. In the foreground, a toilet with a roll of toilet paper beside it and a small window with blinds are visible on the left. A blue rectangular rug is in front of the bathtub, and a pair of blue slippers is placed in the lower right. On the right side, a radiator sits near the window, with a blue towel hanging on a rack above a wooden bench that extends from the right foreground into the middle ground, where a pink towel rests. A rubber duck is placed on the windowsill nearby. The static camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, and the deep focus ensures all elements, including the person standing in the bathtub, the woman relaxing, and the surroundings, remain sharp and clear.",

    "Scene": "The video is set in a cozy, softly lit bathroom with a vintage aesthetic. The room features a freestanding bathtub with claw feet, filled with bubbles. A window with partially closed blinds and a partially drawn curtain allows sunlight to filter in, casting patterned shadows on the walls, suggesting the daytime. The walls are painted in a muted tone, complementing the warm wooden floor. A radiator is positioned next to the window, and a blue towel hangs on a nearby rack above a wooden bench with a green surface, where a pink towel is placed. The bathroom also includes a toilet, a roll of toilet paper, and a hanging bathrobe. A small shelf holds toiletries, and a pair of blue slippers is placed on the floor. The overall atmosphere is serene and intimate.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a bathroom scene, capturing all significant elements and subjects. Initially, one individual with medium-length dark hair, dressed in a white shirt and tie, is seated slightly to the left of center in the middle ground within a freestanding bathtub. This person then stands up, still holding a book, remaining in the same position. Another individual with short hair, wearing a pink shower cap, lies in the bathtub, positioned slightly to the right in the middle ground. Natural light enters from a window located in the upper right of the frame, with blinds and a curtain partially covering it, casting light patterns onto the walls. To the left side of the frame, in the middle ground, there is a hanging bathrobe. In the foreground, a toilet with a roll of toilet paper beside it and a small window with blinds are visible on the left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
