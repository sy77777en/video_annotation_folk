  "merged_caption": "A woman is captured in a full shot, positioned on the left side of the frame. She stands in the middleground on a red carpet atop a raised stage. The scene takes place on a dimly lit stage, featuring a bright red carpet. In the background, a tall, white, vertically slatted wall with the number \"1733\" is visible on the far left. To the center-right in the background, a large installation of stacked, circular objects is illuminated in blue. The camera remains static from a hip-level position with a level angle, using deep focus to keep the speaker and the background elements sharp and clear. The woman, a middle-aged, light-skinned individual with shoulder-length brown hair, is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, knee-length dress and tall black boots. Initially, she faces to her left, holding a small, dark object, likely a presentation remote, in her hands. She makes a gesture with her left hand at the beginning of the clip. The overall lighting is dramatic, with spotlights highlighting the background elements and the central area of the stage, while the surrounding space remains dark. She then turns to her right and finally back to her left. Towards the end, she takes a step back with her left leg.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place on a dimly lit stage, featuring a raised platform with a bright red carpet. In the background, two distinct structures are illuminated with blue light. On the left, a tall, white, vertically slatted wall is marked with the number \"1733.\" To the right, a large installation is composed of numerous stacked, circular objects, creating a textured, glowing blue wall. The overall lighting is dramatic, with spotlights highlighting the background elements and the central area of the stage, while the surrounding space remains dark.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
