  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a person wearing a blue top and light-colored pants descends through a vast, sunlit canyon under a white parachute canopy with yellow-green accents. Initially positioned at the center of the frame, the massive reddish-brown rock pillar extends diagonally across the lower right portion. The camera, from an aerial perspective, starts at a low angle, looking up at the parachutist near the large rock pillar. It rotates clockwise around the pillar while simultaneously ascending and tilting downward, creating a varying Dutch angle as it transitions to a high-angle view. As the camera moves, the subject glides downward along the rock face, circling halfway around the large rock pillar from the left side toward the right. The camera then moves upward while continuing its clockwise roll, maintaining the subject's position near the center of the frame's upper half, even as they fly off toward a lower area of the distant canyon. The scene, captured by a drone, unfolds under a bright blue sky filled with wispy white clouds, highlighting the dramatic, arid landscape dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock spires and formations with a rough, layered texture. Throughout the shot, a deep focus keeps the entire dramatic landscape sharp, emphasizing the dynamic flight and the canyon's vastness.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial perspective, the smooth camera begins at a low angle, looking up at a parachutist near a large rock pillar. It arcs clockwise around the pillar while descending, creating a varying Dutch angle as it transitions to a high-angle view. The camera then moves upward while continuing its clockwise roll. A deep focus keeps the entire dramatic landscape sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "A person descends through a canyon wearing a blue top and light-colored pants, flying under a white parachute canopy with yellow-green accents. ",
    "Motion": "A person flying under a parachute descends alongside a tall, red rock spire. They glide downward along the rock face, circling halfway around the large rock pillar, before flying off toward a lower area of the distant canyon.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic flight through a vast, sunlit canyon dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock spires and formations with a rough, layered texture. The drone's perspective initially rotates clockwise around a central point above the massive rock structures, then ascends while tilting downward to track a person with a predominantly white parachute featuring yellow-green accents. The individual descends along the rock face, circling halfway around the pointed summit of a large rock pillar before proceeding toward a lower section of the distant canyon. The scene unfolds under a bright blue sky filled with wispy white clouds, highlighting the dramatic, arid landscape.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot, a person with a parachute is initially positioned at the center of the frame, with a massive reddish-brown rock pillar extending diagonally across the lower right portion. The camera, starting from a position below the subject, rotates clockwise around the pillar while simultaneously ascending and tilting downward. As the camera moves, the subject descends, circling from the left side of the pillar toward the right. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains the subject's position near the center of the frame's upper half, even as they glide deeper into the canyon below."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
