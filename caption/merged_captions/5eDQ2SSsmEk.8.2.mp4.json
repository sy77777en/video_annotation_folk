  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme close-up shot of a man's face, focusing primarily on his mouth and beard. The shot size remains consistent throughout, capturing only a small portion of the subject's face. The man's face occupies the left side of the frame, with his beard prominently displayed in the foreground. A hand, positioned on the right side of the frame, holds food and moves towards the man's mouth. This hand is also in the foreground, interacting directly with the subject. The background consists of softly blurred circular bokeh lights, indicating a dimly lit environment, and is situated in the middle ground behind the subject. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, ensuring the focus remains on the interaction between the hand and the man's mouth. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing stays tight on the subject's face and the hand throughout the sequence. The video shows the man taking a bite of the food, and his lips close around it. The camera features an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast. The beard appears wet with visible droplets, likely due to stringy, sticky food caught in it, suggesting the individual is in the midst of eating. The setting features a cool color palette with blue and red lighting, creating a moody atmosphere. The background is blurred with bokeh lights, enhancing the focus on the foreground details.",

    "Camera": "The video features an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face in the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features an extreme close-up of a man's face, focusing on his mouth and beard. The man has a thick beard with stringy, sticky food caught in it, suggesting he is in the middle of eating. His lips briefly open to take a bite and then close afterward. In this video, a hand, possibly the man's own, is seen holding the food as he brings it to his mouth. As he bites the food, the extreme close-up captures the detailed strands of his beard and the sticky texture of the food.  The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a close-up of a man's face, focusing on his mouth and beard, with the hand holding the food visible and stringy, sticky food caught in his beard. The man takes a bite of the food, and his lips close around it. The background is blurred with bokeh lights, creating a dramatic effect.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a close-up view of a bearded face in a dimly lit environment, possibly outdoors at night. The setting features a cool color palette with blue and red lighting, creating a moody atmosphere. The beard appears wet with visible droplets, likely due to stringy, sticky food caught in it, suggesting the individual is in the midst of eating. A hand interacts with the beard by holding a piece of food and bringing it to the person's mouth, adding a dynamic element. The background is softly blurred with circular bokeh lights, enhancing the focus on the foreground details.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
