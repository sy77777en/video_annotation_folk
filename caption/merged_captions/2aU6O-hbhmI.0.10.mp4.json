  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban construction site during twilight, captured from a drone's perspective. Initially, the crane is captured from below, positioned in the bottom right quadrant in 2D space and in the foreground in 3D space. As the camera moves, the crane transitions towards the center, maintaining its prominence. The video begins with a view of a section of a crane with cables and a sunset in the background. The camera starts at a low angle and transitions to a high angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. As the camera moves, more of the structure and surrounding buildings come into view, with the sunset casting a warm glow. The construction site occupies the middle ground, spreading across the lower portion of the frame, with materials and equipment scattered throughout. Surrounding buildings appear in the background, framing the site on the left and right sides. The sky, transitioning from blue to orange, fills the upper part of the frame, indicating the time of day. The camera continues to arc and roll, revealing more details of the buildings and the structure, including a building with a blue roof and what appear to be interior lights. The camera then shifts to show a larger area of the construction site, with various buildings and structures becoming visible. The video concludes with a wide view of the construction site, highlighting the extensive development and the ongoing work. The camera maintains a high vantage point, consistently positioned above the crane and the construction site, providing an expansive view of the entire scene. The drone performs complex arcs and rolls smoothly above a construction site in a city at dusk, providing a dynamic view with minimal shaking.",

    "Camera": "The video is a fast-motion aerial shot with noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera starts at a low angle and transitions to a high angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone performs complex arcs and rolls smoothly above a construction site in a city at dusk, providing a dynamic view with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases an urban cityscape with a central focus on a crane positioned prominently in the frame. It captures the intricate details of the construction site within the city environment, highlighting the network of cranes and buildings. The vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and ongoing development, with an emphasis on the environment rather than a specific moving subject.",

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban construction site during twilight. The scene features a large crane with a metallic structure, its long arm extending across the frame. The sky transitions from a soft blue to a warm orange, indicating the time of day as sunset. Below, the construction site is bustling with activity, showcasing various materials and equipment scattered across the area. Buildings surround the site, with some partially constructed, displaying a mix of concrete and steel. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the drone capturing the intricate details of the construction process and the vibrant colors of the evening sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
