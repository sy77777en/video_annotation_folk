  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a small, stylized character stands motionless on a square stone platform in the center of the frame, enveloped in a dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak with two pointed ears or horns protruding, holding an object that emits a vibrant purple glow. The platform is framed by low stone walls, with four large, dark, stylized statues: two in the corners farther from the camera and two near the middle of the opposite side, one of which is broken. The scene unfolds at night, surrounded by dark green water with lily pads floating on the surface. A glowing green crescent moon symbol is etched onto one of the stone tiles. The camera initially arcs counterclockwise around the character while simultaneously moving downward and tilting up, then becomes static with slight, unsteady shaking reflecting the movements of the giant squid ghost. Swirling arcs of green light appear and coalesce, forming the large, translucent, glowing green outline of a squid-like creature with long, curving tentacles. The creature, outlined in a bright neon-green glow, begins to emerge from the water in the middle ground, in front of the small character. Two of its tentacles first touch the stone platform and lift itself up, then its body appears from under the water, dominating the central and upper portions of the frame. As it fully materializes, it splashes pale green droplets in all directions, shedding small, light green water droplets. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, as the spectral creature, with its stylized, squid-like appearance, emerges above the platform where the cloaked character stands.",

    "Camera": "This is a high-angle, overhead shot from a game perspective. The camera initially arcs counterclockwise around the character while simultaneously moving downward and tilting up. It then becomes static, with some slight, unsteady shaking that reflects the movements of the giant squid ghost. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A small, stylized character stands on a stone platform, completely enveloped in a dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak from which two pointed ears or horns protrude. This character holds an object that emits a vibrant purple glow. A large, spectral creature emerges from beneath the water surrounding the platform, appearing as a translucent form outlined in a bright, neon-green glow. The creature has a stylized, squid-like appearance with long, curving tentacles and sheds small, light green water droplets as it fully materializes.",
    "Motion": "A small, cloaked character stands motionless on a stone platform as two tentacles of a large, spectral, squid-like creature make contact with the platform and lift it up. The creature, outlined in a bright green glow, fully emerges from beneath the water. As it materializes, it splashes pale green droplets in all directions.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video, a scene unfolds at night on a square stone platform surrounded by dark green water. The platform is enclosed by low stone walls and features four large, dark, stylized statues, with two positioned at the corners and the other two located near the center of the opposite side. One of these statues is broken, with only the lower part remaining. Lily pads float on the water's surface, and a glowing green crescent moon symbol is etched onto one of the stone tiles. During the scene, swirling arcs of green light appear and coalesce, forming the large, translucent, glowing green outline of a squid-like creature with long tentacles. It first touches the stone platform with two of its tentacles, then lifts itself up, and its body emerges from under the water, materializing above the platform where a cloaked character stands.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a small, cloaked character stands motionless on a square stone platform in the center of the frame initially, but its position appears lower as the camera moves. The platform is framed by low walls, with four large statues on the walls: two in the corners farther from the camera and two near the middle of the opposite side. A large, spectral green creature then begins to emerge from the water in the middle ground, in front of the small character. Two of its tentacles first touch the stone platform and lift itself up, then its body appears from under the water, dominating the central and upper portions of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
