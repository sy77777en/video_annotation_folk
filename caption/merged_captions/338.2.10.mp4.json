  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman seated at a table, wearing a maroon vest with a name tag that reads \"Susan\" over a white shirt. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing glasses. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, with her upper body visible from approximately the waist up. She is seated directly facing the camera, which is at her eye level. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep her in sharp focus while the background and foreground are blurred. The camera smoothly zooms in slowly on the woman, maintaining steadiness throughout. She is holding chopsticks in her right hand above a plate of food, which contains a mix of vegetables and possibly some fried items. The table also has a glass of iced tea with a lemon slice, a bowl of soup, and another plate with green vegetables. To her right (the viewer's left), the glass of iced tea is in the foreground, slightly off-center. In front of her, on the table, are various dishes, including a plate of greens and another dish with mixed ingredients, also in the foreground. A brown container is situated in the bottom right corner of the frame, also in the foreground. The background is dimly lit, providing contrast and focusing attention on the subject and the table setup. The lighting focuses on her, highlighting her calm and composed demeanor. The woman remains still throughout the video, with no significant changes in her posture or the environment, except for her eyes subtly darting around. The spatial arrangement remains constant, emphasizing the subject and the items on the table. The overall color scheme is warm, with earthy tones from the food and the person's attire.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
