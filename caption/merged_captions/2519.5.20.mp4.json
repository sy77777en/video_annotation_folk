  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the upper bodies and hands of two individuals in an indoor setting with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The person on the left, wearing a dark green sweater with a textured pattern, occupies the left side of the frame, with their hands positioned in the middle ground as they manipulate a small object, specifically a band-aid. This individual's left wrist, adorned with a watch, and left hand, featuring a ring, are clearly visible. The person on the right, dressed in a white shirt with blue horizontal stripes, is positioned closer to the camera but turned sideways, with their hands also in the foreground but less active, appearing to observe or assist. An open container with additional items lies in the bottom left corner of the frame, near the person in the green sweater, suggesting a shared task or interaction. The camera features a level angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. It remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the interaction between the two individuals and the objects they handle. The person on the left is seen handling the band-aid with both hands, carefully peeling off the backing and preparing it, while the person on the right keeps their outstretched hand still. The background is dimly lit, focusing on the hands and the object being handled. The overall tone is calm and focused, with the lighting and setting enhancing the sense of a private, thoughtful moment. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence, providing a detached, observational perspective on the interaction.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a cozy room. The focus is on two individuals engaged in a quiet, personal interaction. The person facing the camera is wearing a textured, dark green sweater and is holding a band-aid, peeling off its backing.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
