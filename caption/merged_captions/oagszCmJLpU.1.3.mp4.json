  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The bottom of the frame is occupied by a vast grassy plain that stretches from the foreground to the background horizon. A solitary green tree stands in the lower center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The remaining part of the frame is dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds in the background sky. A sheet of rain is visible in the background, behind the tree, moving across the landscape. The camera is positioned at a low height, level with the plain, looking straight ahead. This time-lapse video captures a dramatic storm developing over the vast, open field. The dark, heavy clouds are seen rapidly swirling and rolling across the sky, with a subtle bluish-green tint in some areas. Rain can be seen falling in the distance as the storm system moves over the landscape. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape, from the grassy field to the turbulent clouds, sharp and clear. The scene is dominated by massive, dark grey storm clouds that swirl and gather, with curtains of rain visibly falling in the distance. The primary focus is on the powerful, ominous atmosphere and the sheer scale of the natural environment, rather than on a specific subject, using the lone tree to emphasize the vastness of the landscape.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video, captured from a low angle, shows a storm gathering over a field. The camera performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire landscape, from the grassy field to the turbulent clouds, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, depicting a vast, flat plain of green and yellow grass under an immense, turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by massive, dark grey storm clouds that swirl and gather, with curtains of rain visibly falling in the distance. A single, small tree stands alone in the middle of the expansive field, appearing small and isolated against the powerful backdrop. The primary focus is on the powerful, ominous atmosphere and the sheer scale of the natural environment, rather than on a specific subject, using the lone tree to emphasize the vastness of the landscape.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic storm developing over a vast, open field. The dark, heavy clouds are seen rapidly swirling and rolling across the sky. Rain can be seen falling in the distance as the storm system moves over the landscape.",
    "Scene": "A solitary green tree stands in the middle of a vast, open grassland composed of yellow and green grasses that extend to the horizon. The sky above is filled with a massive, churning formation of dark gray and black storm clouds, which have a subtle bluish-green tint in some areas. In the distance, a sheet of falling rain moves across the landscape, partially obscuring the horizon under the turbulent sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
