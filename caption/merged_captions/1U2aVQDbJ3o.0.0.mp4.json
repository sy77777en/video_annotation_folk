  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a hot air balloon, capturing its full form against a vast, snow-covered landscape in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland. The balloon, featuring a colorful design with red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, while the snowy terrain stretches out in the background. The setting is outdoors, with a sprawling expanse of snow-covered terrain interspersed with dense clusters of evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light and the low position of the sun on the horizon. As the drone moves closer, the shot size transitions from a wide view to a medium shot, focusing more on the balloon's upper portion. The camera glides forward and tilts downward in a diving motion, smoothly passing above the hot air balloon, which now dominates the view. After crossing over the balloon, the camera angle changes to an aerial view of the snowy terrain below. The camera is now positioned above the ground, providing a bird's-eye view of the winding, snow-covered roads and scattered trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and isolation of the area. In this new perspective, the landscape occupies the entire frame, with white subtitle text appearing at the bottom and in the center, indicating \"LEVI. Arctic Circle, Finland,\" along with a disclaimer about professional driving conditions. The camera maintains this aerial position, capturing the expansive snowy expanse and the intricate patterns of the roads and trees. The transition from the balloon to the ground is smooth, with the camera moving seamlessly from one scene to the next, showcasing a smooth aerial camera movement with no shaking.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases a smooth aerial camera movement, starting from a high angle and transitioning to a bird's eye view. The camera glides forward and tilts downward in a diving motion, smoothly passing above a hot air balloon. Below, the landscape reveals a snowy, forested area with winding roads, set in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland.  The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floating over a snow-covered landscape. As the drone moves closer, the balloon's top becomes the primary focus, eventually transitioning to a bird's eye angle view of the snowy terrain below. The ground is covered in snow with scattered trees, and white subtitle text appears, providing location information.",

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a vast, snowy landscape in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland. The setting is outdoors, featuring a sprawling expanse of snow-covered terrain interspersed with dense clusters of evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light and the low position of the sun on the horizon. A notable visual element is a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue stripes, floating above the landscape. The balloon's material appears smooth and glossy. The scene transitions to an aerial view of a winding, snow-covered road, surrounded by trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and isolation of the area. Overlay elements include text indicating \"LEVI. Arctic Circle, Finland\" prominently displayed in the center, along with a disclaimer at the bottom about professional driving conditions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
