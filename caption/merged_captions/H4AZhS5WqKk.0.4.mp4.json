  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of the upper body of a gray-blue cartoon cat, Tom, in the center foreground, holding a small green ball in his white left hand. The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, characterized by a brick wall reflecting light and a large, black vertical pipe. In the background, an out-of-focus grated iron gate reveals numerous scattered white lights. The camera remains static, filmed from a level angle, with the cartoon cats in sharp focus and the background blurred. Initially, Tom has an angry expression, but as the small green ball disappears from view, a small red cartoon cat, depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail, materializes in a burst of red explosion effect. This red cat, a devil version of Tom, lands on a white cloud that appears beneath him, hovering in the air. The red cat is fully visible in the foreground on the center right, initially jumping to a position slightly above Tom's head before descending to a position slightly below. The gray-blue cat's expression shifts to one of surprise and concern as he observes the smaller red cat, who stands on the floating cloud and holds a red trident. The red cat gestures towards Tom, prodding him with the trident, causing Tom to turn from facing the left side of the frame to the right side. Throughout the scene, light rain falls, adding to the dark, atmospheric setting. The gray-blue cat remains in the center-left foreground, while the red cat's presence and actions create a dynamic interaction between the two characters against the real-world background.",

    "Camera": "This is a static shot filmed from a level angle. The video features two cartoon cats, Tom and a devil version of Tom, set against a real-world background. The cartoon cats remain in sharp focus throughout, while the background is blurred, and the foreground is also in focus.",
    "Subject": "A gray-blue cartoon cat with a white muzzle, a light gray chest patch, and pink inner ears is shown from the upper body up. Initially, he has an angry expression and holds a small green ball in his white left hand. The ball then disappears from view as a small, red cartoon cat, depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail, appears. This red cat, who has a white muzzle, stands on a small white cloud and holds a red trident. The gray-blue cat's expression shifts to one of surprise and concern as he looks at the smaller, red cat. The red cat is shown in his entirety, gesturing towards the larger cat.",
    "Motion": "A small green ball held by a gray-blue cat in his white left hand disappears from view as a small, red cat materializes in a burst of red explosion effect. The red cat lands on a white cloud that appears beneath him, and the cloud hovers in the air. Initially, the larger gray-blue cat has an angry expression, but as he observes the smaller red cat, his expression shifts to one of surprise and concern. At first, he faces the left side of the frame, but after being prodded by the red cat's trident, he turns to face the right side.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, characterized by a brick wall reflecting light and a large, black vertical pipe. In the background, an out-of-focus grated iron gate reveals numerous scattered white lights. A large, blue-gray animated cat is positioned in the alley, holding a single green olive that drops out of the scene at the beginning. A small, red, devil-like animated cat, holding a red trident, materializes and stands on a floating white cloud that appears beneath it. Throughout the scene, light rain falls.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of the upper body of a gray-blue cat in the center foreground. A small green ball is briefly seen in the gray-blue cat's left paw before it falls out of the frame. Then, a small red cat appears in the foreground on the center right, fully visible. It initially jumps to a position slightly above the gray-blue cat's head and then descends to a position slightly below. The gray-blue cat remains in the center-left foreground. The scene features a brick wall and a vertical pipe in the foreground of the real-world background on the left, while in the right background of the real-world background, an out-of-focus grated iron gate reveals numerous scattered white lights."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
