  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a resort patio from an eye-level perspective, filmed from a slightly unsteady, high-angle view. Initially, a round, glass-topped table is positioned in the lower left area of the foreground, with two lounge chairs in the middle ground on the right. A low white wall runs horizontally across the scene, separating the patio from a background of dense green trees. The camera pans slowly from right to left across the patio area, featuring lounge furniture and a sandy garden with lush trees. As the camera pans, the table shifts toward the lower center of the frame, revealing a sandy area and a large tree trunk in the left and center middle ground, while the lounge chairs move to the far right of the frame. The white wall and the background foliage remain consistently visible throughout the shot. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field. The paved area features a grey floor, furnished with two lounge chairs with dark frames and grey cushions, and a round, glass-topped table with a dark woven base, on which a small white box is placed. Beyond the patio lies a small area of sand and a dense backdrop of lush green tropical trees and plants, creating a secluded, natural ambiance. The focus is on conveying a sense of tranquility and the blend of modern comfort with nature, rather than on a specific person or object. The scene captures a tranquil, tropical patio setting during the daytime, showcasing two distinct sections: a paved area and a small sandy zone. The sandy zone is home to a large tree with a thick, gnarled trunk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
