  "merged_caption": "The shot begins with a red humanoid figure in the bottom left foreground, initially in sharp focus, while a large crowd on bleachers in the middle ground and background remains blurred. This 3D animated video features a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the red figure in the foreground. The camera remains stationary while performing a rack focus, shifting the focus to the crowd and bleachers in the background. The focus then racks from the foreground to the background, causing the red figure to become out of focus. Simultaneously, the crowd of white and grey figures comes into sharp focus, revealing they are seated on large bleachers that occupy the center of the frame and standing in formation on the ground in the middle ground. The camera's position remains static throughout this transition. The video initially focuses on a stylized, glossy red humanoid figure lying on its side in the foreground on the lower left. The focus then shifts to the background, revealing a large crowd of indistinct, white and grey humanoid figures. This crowd is assembled in a stadium-like setting, with many figures seated in rows on bleachers and others standing in formation on the ground in front of them. In the middle of the background crowd, there is a speaker dressed in a suit, standing out among the uniform figures. In a stark, monochromatic outdoor setting resembling a stadium, large bleachers are filled with a crowd of indistinct white figures. The background features simple, gray architectural structures and trees against a white ground. The only point of color is a single, stylized human figure in the foreground, rendered in bright red and positioned low to the ground. Overlay text \"[8]\" is located in the bottom left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
