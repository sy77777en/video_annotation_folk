  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair with bangs lying in bed, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Her head rests on a pillow with a black and white geometric pattern to the left, while a red and green plaid blanket occupies the bottom and right portions of the frame. The room is dimly lit, cast in a cool, dark blue light, suggesting it is nighttime. She is wearing a dark top and is initially asleep, her head resting on the pillow. As she awakens, opening her eyes and looking forward with a slightly alert expression, the camera moves slowly and smoothly forward from a hip-level position while rolling counterclockwise, creating a dynamic Dutch angle effect. Suddenly, her eyes widen, and her facial expression shifts to show alertness and fear. She then turns her head and eyes to her left. A shallow depth of field keeps the woman in focus as the camera movement enhances the sense of unease in the scene.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level, the camera moves slowly and smoothly forward while rolling counterclockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the woman sleeping in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "A woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair with bangs is shown lying in bed in a dimly lit, cool-toned room. Initially, she is asleep, her head resting on a pillow with a black and white geometric pattern. She is wearing a dark top and is covered up to her shoulders by a red and green plaid blanket. She then wakes up, opening her eyes and looking forward with a still, slightly alert expression.",
    "Motion": "A woman lies on her side in bed, asleep. Suddenly, she wakes up with wide eyes, her facial expression showing alertness and fear. She then turns her head and eyes to her left.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit bedroom at night, a woman is seen sleeping in bed. The room is cast in a cool, dark blue light. She is covered by a red and green plaid blanket, and her head rests on a pillow with a black and white geometric pattern. She awakens suddenly, her eyes opening as she looks forward into the darkness of the room.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a woman lying in bed, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Her head rests on a pillow to the left, while a plaid blanket occupies the bottom and right portions of the frame. As she awakens, opening her eyes and looking forward, the camera subtly and smoothly moves forward while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, creating a dynamic Dutch angle effect."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
