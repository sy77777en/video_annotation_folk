  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured at the subjects' level, a large dark grey African elephant is initially positioned in the center of the frame, walking from right to left across the middle ground of a savanna landscape characterized by tall, golden-yellow dry grass. A second, larger dark grey elephant and a significantly smaller, dark grey baby elephant enter from the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground, and walk in front of the first elephant, continuing the leftward movement as a group. The rearmost adult elephant proceeds with the baby elephant moving ahead of it, while another adult elephant leads the group. All three maintain a consistent walking pace through the tall, dry grass. An additional adult elephant remains stationary behind the group, observing their movement. The scene is composed of tall, golden grass in the foreground and middle ground, with scattered low green bushes and small, dark, rounded mounds visible in the middle ground, some behind the elephants. In the background, a line of hazy blue-grey hills stretches across the horizon beneath a pale, hazy sky, bathed in soft, diffuse light. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle, and uses deep focus, keeping the elephants and the background savanna sharp. It pans slowly to the left, tracking the elephants from the side, with slight unsteadiness, capturing the movement of the group as they traverse the wide expanse of the savanna.",

    "Subject": "The video features a group of dark grey African elephants traversing a savanna landscape characterized by tall, dry, yellow-brown grass. An adult elephant, viewed from its left side, walks across the scene from right to left; it has visible tusks. A significantly smaller, dark grey baby elephant walks in front of this adult. Another adult elephant, also dark grey and similar in size to the first, walks in front of the baby, maintaining the same direction and profile view. Meanwhile, one elephant remains stationary as the three elephants move from right to left.",
    "Motion": "A group of three elephants, comprising two adults and one baby, traverses the savanna from right to left. The rearmost adult elephant proceeds, with the baby elephant moving ahead of it. Leading the group, another adult elephant walks in front of the baby. All three maintain a consistent walking pace as they move through the tall, dry grass. An additional adult elephant remains stationary behind the group, observing their movement.",
    "Scene": "Elephants, appearing as dark grey forms, traverse a wide expanse of tall, golden-yellow dry grass in an outdoor savanna landscape. Scattered low green bushes and small, dark, rounded mounds are visible across the plain. In the distance, hazy blue-grey hills meet a pale, hazy sky, bathed in soft, diffuse light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
