  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, a large delivery bag occupies the foreground from the bottom left to the center, held by a person partially visible on the far left wearing a red and dark blue jacket. A light-skinned man with muscular arms, wearing a blue t-shirt and a beige apron, stands in the center-right middle ground, initially holding a small, rectangular, light brown cardboard box in the bottom right of the frame. He moves the box upwards and forward, placing it inside the large, grey insulated delivery bag, which is red on the outside with a silver-colored insulated interior and black straps. After placing the box inside, he uses both hands to ensure it is positioned securely and properly within the bag. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, is quite unsteady throughout the shot, with a high-angle, eye-level perspective and a shallow depth of field focusing on the man's hands as he arranges the box. In the blurred background, professional kitchen equipment, including multiple silver stand mixers and a yellow cup, rests on a counter on the left and center. The scene is set in a brightly lit commercial kitchen, with the camera's unsteady motion lacking a clear pattern, capturing the dynamics of the man lowering the box into the bag and adjusting it.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's hands as he places a container into a delivery bag. The camera is quite unsteady, with motion that lacks a clear pattern.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with muscular arms, wearing a blue t-shirt and a beige apron, places a small, rectangular, light brown cardboard box into a large delivery bag. The bag, held by a second person partially seen on the left wearing a red and dark blue jacket, is red on the outside with a silver-colored insulated interior and black straps.",
    "Motion": "A man in an apron lowers a small cardboard box into a large, insulated delivery bag held open by another person. After placing the box inside, he uses both hands to ensure it is positioned securely and properly within the bag.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit commercial kitchen, a person wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron places a small, rectangular cardboard container into a large, grey insulated delivery bag positioned in the foreground. The bag, which has a silver interior lining and black trim, is held open. In the blurred background, professional kitchen equipment, including multiple silver stand mixers and a yellow cup, rests on a counter. A second person, partially visible in a red and blue jacket, is positioned next to the bag.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
