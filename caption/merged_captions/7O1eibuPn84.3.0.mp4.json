  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a ground-level shot featuring a blurry light brown foreground, a strip of darker earth with sparse grass in the middle ground, and a blurred green and brown background. From a ground-level, level angle, the shot begins out of focus with a shallow depth of field. The camera then smoothly pans left to follow a turtle as it slowly walks into the frame from the right, moving steadily across the dirt ground toward the left. The turtle has a high-domed, tan-colored shell with a distinct pattern of black geometric blotches and lines. Its skin is light brown and wrinkled, and its thick, scaly legs are visible as it moves across the dirt ground. As the turtle enters from the right, walking leftward into the middle ground, the scene transitions into a full shot of the animal. The background is a soft, out-of-focus blend of green and brown, suggesting distant foliage, effectively emphasizing the turtle and the narrow section of the path it traverses. As the turtle occupies the right side of the frame, a white text box labeled \"TURTLE\" appears as an overlay in the bottom-left corner. The text overlay \"TURTLE\" starts small and centered, then dynamically enlarges and transitions to the lower-left corner. As the video concludes, the text diminishes in size and repositions towards the center of the screen. The camera remains positioned at the turtle's level throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is captured from a level angle, focusing on a light brown dirt path under natural daylight. A few sparse blades of green grass sprout from the dusty ground. The background is a soft, out-of-focus blend of green and brown, suggesting distant foliage, effectively emphasizing the turtle and the narrow section of the path it traverses. A turtle with a patterned shell slowly walks into the scene from the right. The text overlay \"TURTLE\" starts small and centered, then dynamically enlarges and transitions to the lower-left corner.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
