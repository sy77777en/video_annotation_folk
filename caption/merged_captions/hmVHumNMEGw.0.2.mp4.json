  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a young Black man with bleached blonde, close-cropped hair, wearing a black t-shirt with large, white capital letters, of which \"INK\" and \"RE\" are partially visible. A pink, unzipped jacket is draped over his shoulders, and he has small hoop earrings in both earlobes. He stands in the center foreground, framed by green bushes and small, manicured trees, including some that resemble bonsai in planters, in the middle ground on the left and right. In the background, distinctive reddish-brown, terraced apartment buildings are visible at the top of the frame. The scene is set in an outdoor, landscaped garden during the daytime under an overcast sky. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in focus. The man stands still, looking directly forward with a serious, fixed expression. The camera then pulls back smoothly, transitioning into a full shot, featuring a rapid dolly zoom effect: it first moves backward while zooming in on the man, then slightly moves forward while zooming out at the very end. In the final framing, the man remains in the center of the composition, now fully visible in the middle ground, which reveals more of the surrounding garden and its pathways.",

The shot features a rapid dolly zoom effect: the camera first moves backward while zooming in on the man, then slightly moves forward while zooming out at the very end.",
    "Subject": "The video features a young Black man with bleached blonde, close-cropped hair looking directly forward with a serious expression.

    "Motion": "The man stands still, looking directly forward with a fixed expression. There is no discernible movement throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an outdoor, landscaped garden during the daytime under an overcast sky. In the background, distinctive reddish-brown, terraced apartment buildings are visible. The middle ground features a mix of green bushes and small, manicured trees, including some that resemble bonsai in planters.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
