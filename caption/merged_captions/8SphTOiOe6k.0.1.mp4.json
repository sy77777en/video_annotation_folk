  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a sunlit Japanese street scene. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead with a deep focus and large depth of field, and it pans right with slightly unsteady movement. On the left side, in the middle ground, a food stall with a green awning and a menu board is active with customers and staff, while a woman in a red jacket, wearing glasses and a mask, walks from the left towards the right within this area. In the center foreground, a woman in black clothing with a white face mask faces to her left initially. A multi-directional signpost is positioned in the center-left middle ground, slightly behind and to the left of the woman. Stone and wooden pillars are visible in the center-right foreground. On the right side, in the middle ground, another food stall is seen, with several women in traditional kimonos standing in front of it; a pole with a solar panel is also visible in this right middle ground area, further to the right. Near this stall, two women chat in front of an individual in a light purple kimono who remains with her back to the camera. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk in the far right middle ground and background, where a red car also approaches from the background. Buildings line the background of the scene, featuring traditional Japanese tiled roofs and wooden elements. A person in a black top walks from left to right across the foreground, then turns to their right, looking down while scratching their shoulder with their right arm and hand. In the far background, two pedestrians walk away from the camera, another pedestrian is faintly visible walking towards the camera, and a red car drives towards the camera on the road.",

The food stalls have Japanese signage and display various items. A prominent multi-directional signpost is also visible. The woman in the light purple kimono is not holding flowers; it is the obi knot (otaiko musubi) on the back of her kimono.",

    "Scene": "An objective POV shot captures a sunlit street scene in Japan, where pedestrians walk along a paved sidewalk. On the left, a food stall with a green awning and a menu board displays various items. To the right, another shop with a sign featuring \"チーズカツ\" (cheese katsu) in black lettering is visible. In front of the shops, a prominent white directional sign with black text and a red arrow pattern points to locations such as \"Chikurin-no-komichi\" (Bamboo Forest Path) and \"Nonomiya Shrine,\" indicating distances. Several individuals are present, some in contemporary attire and others in traditional Japanese kimonos, one of which is a light purple color. The buildings feature traditional Japanese tiled roofs and wooden elements. Small stone markers and a pole with a solar panel are also visible along the street. The overall atmosphere is that of a bustling daytime commercial or tourist area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
