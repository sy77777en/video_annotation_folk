  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a desolate coastal landscape in black and white. The camera is positioned at a high angle on a sand dune, looking down a path towards a wide, flat beach and the sea. In the foreground, dark, leafless bushes are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right, framing the view and creating a stark and somber mood. Small patches of short grass are scattered on both the right and left sides in the middle ground. A sandy path begins at the bottom center and leads through the middle ground towards the beach, which occupies the horizontal center of the frame. In the background, the ocean stretches across the upper-middle portion of the frame, with an overcast sky filling the top. The camera captures the scene with a deep focus, ensuring that both the foreground bushes and the distant ocean remain clear, achieving the clarity and perspective of a high-angle shot. The path opens onto a wide, flat beach marked with patterns from the wind. In the distance, the ocean stretches out under a solid grey, overcast sky, with gentle waves forming horizontal lines on the water's surface. The focus of the shot is on the overall desolate and quiet atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the moody, overcast sky rather than a specific main subject. The composition uses the natural lines of the dunes and bushes to create a sense of depth and draw the viewer into the cold, serene scene.",

The camera's perspective is from a high vantage point on a sand dune, looking down a path that leads towards the ocean. Dark, leafless, and thorny bushes in the foreground frame the view on both the left and right sides, guiding the eye towards the wide, flat beach and the calm sea beyond.

    "Scene": "In a black and white outdoor scene, the perspective is from a sand dune looking out towards the ocean. Dark, leafless bushes on either side of the foreground frame a path that descends through the dunes. In the middle ground, small patches of short grass are scattered on both the right and left sides of the path. This path opens onto a wide, flat beach marked with patterns from the wind.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
