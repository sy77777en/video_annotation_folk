  "merged_caption": "This wide, top-down shot frames a Black man lying on his back in the center of the middle ground on a paved surface. He is wearing a black jacket over a blue and white patterned shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers with green accents. Positioned at the top of the frame is another Black man seated on a black-and-red bicycle, with a black tire next to him, while a blue-and-white bicycle lies upside down on the ground at the bottom of the frame, next to an orange-and-white traffic barrier. Near the first man's feet, a BMX-style bike with a white frame and blue accents on the rims and handlebars also lies on its side on the pavement. The video begins with an eye-level view, showing the man lying on his back, and then transitions to a high-angle perspective. The camera executes a very smooth, arcing crane shot, moving upward in an arc. As it cranes upward, reaching a bird's-eye view directly above the person, the elements at the top and bottom of the frame shift toward the edges as the overall view expands to reveal more of the surrounding pavement. The man on the ground exhibits slight movements in his hands and face, while the other man sits still on the bicycle. The bicycles remain stationary on the ground. The camera continues its arc to finish in an upside-down high-angle view, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the movement. The scene is captured during the day under even lighting, providing a clear view of all elements.",

    "Subject": "From a high, top-down perspective, a Black man with short hair lies on his back on a paved surface. He is wearing a black jacket over a blue and white patterned shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers with green accents. To his left, another Black man is seated on a black-and-red bicycle, with a black tire next to him. To the first man's right, a blue-and-white bicycle is positioned upside down on the ground, accompanied by an orange-and-white traffic barrier.

    "Motion": "From a high, top-down perspective, the camera moves upward in an arc. A man lies on his back on the pavement, with slight movements in his hands and face. Another person, a Black man, sits still on a bicycle, while another bicycles remain stationary on the ground.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with an eye-level view, showing a Black man lying on his back on a paved concrete surface. To his left, a black-and-red bicycle is occupied by another Black man, with a black tire nearby. To his right, a blue-and-white bicycle is positioned upside down on the ground, next to an orange-and-white traffic barrier. The scene is captured during the day under even lighting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
