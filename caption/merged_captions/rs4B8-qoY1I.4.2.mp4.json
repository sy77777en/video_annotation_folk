  "merged_caption": "A green humanoid figure starts left of center near a central pillar with a chest in front of it. An archway is on the far left, and a table is on the right. Green rectangular shapes form walls on the top. The humanoid figure, wearing a green outfit and a hat, begins its journey at the archway in the upper left corner of the screen. The figure moves diagonally towards the bottom right, stopping in front of a stack of blocks. It then turns and moves to the lower left side of the blocks before changing direction towards the lower right. Next, the figure approaches the upper right side of a small table and starts moving the table towards the lower left. Throughout the video, a yellow sun-like object within a red scroll-like frame in the lower right corner moves horizontally from left to right, indicating the passage of time or day. Additional interface elements include a green scroll displaying an icon and the number \"04\" at the bottom left, and the word \"Day\" above \"00\" at the bottom center. The scene is a third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle, showcasing a retro, pixelated environment rendered in green on a black background. The environment features blocky, green structures, including an archway on the left, a tall, tiered pillar in the center with a chest in front of it, and a table-like object on the right. On top of the central pillar, there is a green shoe. The camera is static, maintaining a consistent view of the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video showcases a pixelated, retro-style scene with a green and black color scheme. A small, humanoid figure with a blocky appearance and a green outfit is visible, moving around a room with brick walls. The figure bypasses a tall stack of blocks and then moves next to a small table, interacting with it. In the lower right corner, within a red, arc-shaped frame, a yellow, sun-like object gradually moves from left to right, becoming visible. The scene includes a scroll-like interface at the bottom, displaying numbers and symbols, adding to the vintage game aesthetic.",

A small, green, pixelated character wearing a hat moves from near the central pillar towards the table. Green rectangular shapes surrounding the top of the frame represent walls. On top of the central pillar, there is a green shoe. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays game interface elements: on the left, a green scroll border encloses a person icon and the number \"04\"; in the center, the word \"Day\" appears in blue with a white overlay text \"00\" below it, flanked by green parts of the scroll; and on the right, a red scroll border frames a yellow sun icon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
