  "merged_caption": "The scene presents an overhead view of a monochromatic map centered on Türkiye, depicted in dark gray with lighter gray outlines against a black background showing surrounding regions and bodies of water. The text \"Türkiye\" is positioned in the center-right area of the map. In the top-left quadrant, the city of Bursa is highlighted with a white outline, labeled \"Bursa\" in white text, and indicated by a white arrow pointing to its location. Attribution text is located in the bottom-left corner as a foreground overlay: \"[H] - © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO\". The video begins with a close-up view of the map focusing on the region around Bursa. As the camera smoothly zooms out to the right, the label 'Bursa' and the arrow pointing to it gradually become more prominent. The map continues to zoom out, revealing more of the surrounding regions and the overall shape of Türkiye. The label 'Bursa' and the arrow remain visible as the camera zooms out further, showing the entire map of Türkiye. The camera movement makes the map and its labels appear progressively smaller within the frame, revealing more of the black background surrounding the map. The relative positions of the elements remain constant, and the perspective is consistently from directly above. The video concludes with a wide view of the map, clearly displaying the location of Bursa within Türkiye.",

    "Scene": "The video displays a monochromatic map centered on Türkiye. The country's landmass is depicted in dark gray with lighter gray outlines, set against a black background showing surrounding regions and bodies of water. Overlaid onto the map is a white pointer directed at a location in northwestern Türkiye, accompanied by the white text label \"Bursa\". The name \"Türkiye\" is overlaid in larger white text across the central part of the country map. At the bottom left corner, an overlay provides attribution text: \"[H] - © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO\". The scene remains static throughout the video, and the camera slowly zooms out.",
    "Spatial": "The scene presents an overhead view of a map centered on Türkiye, which serves as the background. The text \"Türkiye\" is positioned in the center-right area of the map (middle ground). In the top-left quadrant, the city of Bursa is highlighted, accompanied by the label \"Bursa\" and a pointer directed towards the highlighted area, all situated in the middle ground. Attribution text is located in the bottom-left corner as a foreground overlay. The camera slowly zooms out during the shot, making the map and its labels appear progressively smaller within the frame, revealing more of the black background surrounding the map. The relative positions of the elements remain constant. The perspective is consistently from directly above."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
