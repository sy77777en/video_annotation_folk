  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of the car's interior, highlighting the tan leather seats and central console with air vents, prominently featured in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned at hip level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that focuses on the midground. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly moves backward, transitioning from the car's interior to its exterior, with occasional upward and downward motion. This reveals more of the car's interior, including the door panels and the open rear door. The video then transitions to a full shot of the black luxury sedan, centrally positioned with open doors revealing the interior. The shiny silver alloy wheels are visible on the right. The paved parking area extends from the foreground to the background in the lower portion of the frame, with a building featuring a flat roof situated at the center in the upper portion of the frame. The camera continues to pull back, providing a complete view of the car from the outside, with both the front and rear doors open, highlighting the elegant and high-quality finish of the vehicle. The scene takes place outdoors during the day under a clear sky, emphasizing the car's sleek design and features. The car's shiny exterior and aerodynamic shape are accentuated, while the spacious and well-appointed cabin underscores the vehicle's premium quality and attention to detail. The setting is calm, with no visible movement or people, further emphasizing the car's design and features. The camera maintains a consistent level with the car, offering a detailed perspective of the vehicle's design and surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
