  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a full shot, initially featuring a black stick figure with a round head, a slender body, and disproportionately large, blocky black feet in the center, catching a simple, solid red ball with both hands. A thin black horizontal line, representing the ground, is positioned at the bottom of the frame, with sparse green scribbles indicating grass scattered along it. The background is a plain white expanse. The black stick figure uses both hands to catch the falling red ball and then tucks it into its chest. After catching the ball, the figure grows taller and walks to the right, with its legs moving alternately and its hands resting on its hips without swinging. The video appears to be 2D, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject. The camera remains stationary for most of the video. Near the end, as the person starts to walk, the camera begins trucking smoothly to the right, following the person. The setting features a minimalist outdoor environment, captured in a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, showing the scene or character in profile.",

    "Subject": "The video features a black stick figure with a round head, a slender body, and disproportionately large, blocky black feet. The stick figure is depicted holding a simple, solid red ball.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a minimalist outdoor environment. The setting features a stark white background with a thin black horizontal line representing the ground. Small, sparse green scribbles, resembling blades of grass, are scattered along this ground line.",

A thin black horizontal line, representing the ground, is positioned at the bottom of the frame, with sparse green scribbles indicating grass scattered along it. The background is a plain white expanse. After catching the ball, the figure walks towards the right side of the frame while staying centered. It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
