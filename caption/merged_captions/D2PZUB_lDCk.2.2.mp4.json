  "merged_caption": "This abstract scene is captured from a static frame. A landscape of undulating golden particles occupies the bottom of the frame. Positioned in the horizontal bottom center, a bright light source glows at the horizon line where the particle landscape meets the dark space. From this central area, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, extending into the rest of the frame. A field of golden particles at the bottom of the frame undulates in slow, wave-like motions. From this glittering surface, numerous points of light ascend, some leaving delicate trails of vertical golden lines, while others form small paths resembling golden frost. Additional golden particles of various sizes drift and float throughout the space, gently flickering and gradually fading away. Initially, the points of light that leave fine trails move at a normal speed, then accelerate rapidly for a few seconds before returning to their original speed at the end. The camera remains completely static throughout the video. The dark, deep-gold background is filled with shimmering golden elements, creating a captivating visual effect. Some lights form small paths resembling golden frost, while others flicker and slowly fade away, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Additional golden particles of various sizes, some appearing as sharp specks and others as soft, out-of-focus orbs, drift and float throughout the space. A bright, horizontal light source glows intensely at the horizon line, where the wavy particle field meets the dark background. From a bright, central point on the horizon, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, accompanied by smaller, floating specks of light. These luminous particles drift throughout the space, creating a dynamic effect of rising and falling golden light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
