  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a high-angle aerial view of a sprawling airport complex at night. The camera subtly moves in a counterclockwise arc as it pans from right to left and descends, creating a spiraling downward effect over a 3D model of an airport. The airport's infrastructure is outlined by glowing green and white lights, which fill the entire frame from the background to the middle ground. The runways and taxiways are arranged in a grid pattern, illuminated with glowing lines and dots. A brightly lit, circular terminal building with several branching concourses is positioned in the lower right of the frame in the middle ground. The surrounding area appears as a flat, featureless greyish ground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire airport layout sharp and clear. A text overlay reading \"July 7, 2017\" is located in the center of the screen.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a wide, aerial scenery shot of a sprawling airport complex at night, with the focus on the vast scale and intricate layout of the infrastructure rather than a specific subject. The dark landscape is illuminated by a complex grid of glowing green and white lights that delineate the multiple intersecting runways and taxiways. In the lower right portion of the frame, a large, brightly lit circular terminal building is visible, with several concourses extending from it. A white text overlay in the center of the image reads \"July 7, 2017\".",
    "Motion": "This is a computer-generated animation showing a high-angle, wide view of an airport at night. The runways and taxiways are illuminated with glowing lines and dots, and a central terminal building is also lit up. A text overlay in the center of the screen reads \"July 7, 2017.\" The camera gently descends in a spiral motion while also panning throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime aerial view of a large, modern airport. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights, with glowing green and white lines tracing the dark asphalt runways and taxiways, which are arranged in a grid pattern. A brightly lit, circular main terminal with several branching concourses sits at the center of the layout. The surrounding area appears as a flat, featureless greyish ground. A black rectangular overlay with the white text \"July 7, 2017\" is positioned in the middle of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
