  "merged_caption": "The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects in a dimly lit, crowded outdoor setting at night, with indistinct, blurred lights in the distant background suggesting a city street or event. Initially, a man in a black coat and hat is positioned in the left foreground, looking towards a second man in a grey suit and dark fedora, who occupies the right foreground and faces slightly left. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle with a shallow depth of field focused on the foreground, though it exhibits some minor, unintentional shaking. The man in the black coat places his left hand on the back of the man in the grey suit, then turns to his right and moves towards the right side of the frame, moving somewhat behind the second man and eventually exiting the frame from the right, leaving only his left hand resting on the back of the second man. Subsequently, a third man with glasses, a smiling expression, and a patterned tie enters from the right foreground, moving to the left foreground to engage with the second man, who remains in the right foreground, now facing left towards the third man. The man in the grey suit turns his head to the left to engage with the man with glasses. Several other indistinct figures, appearing to be men in hats and suits, remain relatively static in the crowded, dark background throughout the scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the foreground. There is some minor, unintentional movement, and the camera is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, crowded setting, three men are featured. Initially, a man wearing a black coat, white collared shirt, and black hat appears on the left. He pats the shoulder of a man in a grey suit, who maintains a serious expression and wears a dark fedora, a white collared shirt, and a dark, solid-colored tie. The first man then moves behind him. Subsequently, another man with glasses, a smiling expression, and a patterned tie enters the frame and engages in conversation with the man in the grey suit on the right. Several other indistinct figures, appearing to be men in hats and suits, are visible in the dark background.",
    "Motion": "Initially, a man in a black coat, positioned on the left, places his left hand on the back of a man in a grey suit who is in front of him. The first man then turns to his right and moves towards the right side of the frame, moving somewhat behind the second man and eventually exiting the frame from the right. Subsequently, a third man, wearing glasses, enters the frame from the right and looks towards the first man on the right side of the frame, causing the man in the grey suit to turn his head to the left to engage with him. Several other indistinct figures remain relatively static in the crowded, dark background.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors at night, in what appears to be a crowded public space. The environment is dark, with indistinct, blurred lights visible in the distant background, suggesting a city street or an event. The overall atmosphere is dimly lit, with the focus on the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects. Initially, a man in a black hat is positioned in the left foreground, looking towards a second man in a grey suit and dark fedora, who occupies the right foreground and faces slightly left. The first man then moves from the left foreground to the right, exiting the frame on the right side, leaving only his left hand resting on the back of the second man. Subsequently, a third man with glasses enters from the right foreground, moving to the left foreground to engage with the second man, who remains in the right foreground, now facing left towards the third man. Indistinct figures are present in the dark background throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
