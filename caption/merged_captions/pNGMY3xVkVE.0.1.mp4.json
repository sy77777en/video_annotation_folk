  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a group of several young adults walks away from the camera down the center of a long, cylindrical tunnel with corrugated metal walls and a paneled floor, which extends from the foreground into the background. The tunnel is initially cast in a dark red light from small fixtures on the ceiling. The group walks in a loose formation, with individuals seen from behind in two rows on the left and right sides. Leading the line on the left side is a man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers. Behind him is a man in a dark hoodie over a t-shirt and dark pants. On the right side, a woman in a dark top and pants is followed by a man wearing a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants. A woman with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark checkered crop top and dark pants with a grommeted belt, is also visible on the left side of the group. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, captures this slow-motion shot from a smooth, hip-level perspective, slowly dollying forward as it follows the group toward a bright white light emanating from a partially open roll-up door in the center background. As the group moves deeper into the tunnel, more people appear in the foreground on the left and right, expanding the group's formation. The white light from the center background intensifies, eventually expanding to fill the entire frame. This growing light first silhouettes the figures, and while it brightens the scene significantly, the outline of the group remains visible. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp as the figures become silhouetted against the intensely bright light, with the scene enveloped in white light while their outlines remain visible.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion shot is captured from a smooth, hip-level perspective. The camera slowly dollies forward, following a group of people as they walk down a dark tunnel toward a bright light. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A group of several young adults, seen from behind, walks down a long, narrow tunnel in two rows on the left and right sides. Leading the line on the left side is a man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers. Behind him is a man in a dark hoodie over a t-shirt and dark pants. On the right side, a woman in a dark top and pants is followed by a man wearing a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants. A woman with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark checkered crop top and dark pants with a grommeted belt, is also visible on the left side of the group. All individuals are walking away from the camera toward a bright light at the end of the tunnel, with more people gradually appearing as the video progresses.",
    "Motion": "A group of people walks in a loose formation away from the camera, proceeding down a long, red-lit tunnel. As they move forward, they continue walking toward an intensely bright white light at the tunnel's end. The figures become silhouetted as the light grows in intensity, with the scene enveloped in white light while the outlines of the characters remain visible.",
    "Scene": "A group of people walks down a long, cylindrical corridor with corrugated metal walls and a paneled floor. The tunnel is initially cast in a dark red light from small fixtures on the ceiling. At the far end, a bright white light shines from behind a partially open roll-up door. As the figures walk toward the opening, the white light intensifies, eventually filling the entire corridor and bleaching the scene to white, silhouetting the people while their outlines remain visible.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a group of people walks away from the camera down the center of a long, cylindrical tunnel, which extends from the foreground into the background. The tunnel's corrugated walls frame the scene on the left and right, converging toward a partially open door in the center background, from which a bright light emanates. The group primarily remains in the foreground and middle ground as the camera follows them at a slightly slower pace. As the group moves deeper into the tunnel, more people appear in the foreground on the left and right, expanding the group's formation. Simultaneously, the white light from the center background intensifies, eventually expanding to fill the entire frame. This growing light first silhouettes the figures, and while it brightens the scene significantly, the outline of the group remains visible. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
