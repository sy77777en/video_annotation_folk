  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subject's level, a young woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a grey long-sleeved sweatshirt and dark leggings, stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In front of her, a brownish-orange container with a yellow rim is positioned in the center-foreground on an asphalt road in a suburban area, bordered by a concrete curb. A large volume of water erupts upwards and outwards from the container, expanding to fill the center of the frame and momentarily obscuring the woman as the droplets spread across the foreground and middle ground. The woman appears to grimace and recoils from the splash as the water begins to fall. In the background, trees are visible across the top of the frame, with a green dumpster and a parked car located in the right-middle ground under a sunny sky. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot, positioned at a level, hip-height angle, and uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion as the water erupts. A shallow depth of field is used, with the focus kept on the splashing water in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This video uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion as a water balloon explodes. The static camera is positioned at a level, hip-height angle. A shallow depth of field is used, with the focus kept on the splashing water in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A young woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a grey long-sleeved sweatshirt and dark leggings, stands behind a brownish-orange container with a yellow rim. A large volume of water erupts upwards from the container, creating a wide splash of droplets that momentarily obscures her. The woman appears to grimace as the water begins to splash.",
    "Motion": "A large volume of water erupts upwards from a container, creating a wide splash of droplets. The splash momentarily obscures a woman standing behind it. As the water begins to fall, the woman recoils from the splash.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on an asphalt road in a suburban area, bordered by a concrete curb. In the background, a line of evergreen and bare-branched trees stands before a partially visible building. Further down the road, a green dumpster and a parked car are visible under a sunny sky. In the foreground, a large volume of water splashes upwards and outwards from a container placed on the pavement, with a person in a grey sweatshirt standing behind the eruption.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
