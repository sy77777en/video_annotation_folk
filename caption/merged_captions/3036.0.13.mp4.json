  "merged_caption": "A woman with long, dark hair and light skin is featured in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. She is shown from the chest up, wearing a light-colored, draped top. Her eyes are closed, and her expression is neutral. The camera is completely static, positioned at eye level and a level angle to capture a head-on view of the woman. The background is dimly lit with a solid, neutral tone, lacking sufficient detail to determine the camera's focus. Initially, her face is covered with a black mask. Her face, with eyes closed, is illuminated from below by a light with a purple and pink hue. A green line scans from her neck to her face, revealing a pattern of small, white, glowing dots on her skin, located on the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. A pattern of light is projected onto her face, casting a purplish hue on her forehead and cheeks, along with several small, bright white dots arranged across her nose, cheeks, and chin. The woman remains completely still throughout the video, with her eyes closed. The shot remains static throughout, with no changes in the subject's position, shot size, or camera angle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
