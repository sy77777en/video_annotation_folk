  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man of East Asian appearance, with short black hair, wearing round glasses, a beige polo shirt, and dark pleated pants, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at his level. In the foreground, several colorful sticky notes are adhered to a transparent surface: \"OUR NET-WORTH\" is at the bottom left, \"Dead Line\" is to its right, an up/down arrow symbol is near the center, and a line graph is to the right of the arrow. The man, initially counting a stack of US dollar bills with both hands, takes a few bills from the stack in his left hand with his right hand. As he counts, he slightly shakes his head and sighs, appearing somewhat serious. After counting, he places the bills back on top of the stack in his left hand. He then takes one of the two yellow sticky notes, which are held between the fingers of his left hand, and places the one marked '1000' on the glass surface in the foreground, above and slightly to the right of the arrow symbol and at the center of the frame. The office environment, featuring a brightly lit, modern open-plan layout with wooden desks, black office chairs, and numerous potted plants of various sizes, occupies the background throughout the shot. Overhead, fluorescent light panels and exposed ventilation pipes are visible. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the man in the midground. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movement. The shot size and camera position relative to the man remain constant.",

    "Subject": "A man of East Asian appearance, with short black hair, wearing round glasses, a beige polo shirt, and dark pleated pants, is observed in an office setting. He holds a fan of US dollar bills in both hands, appearing to count them, while his left hand fingers are clipping two small yellow sticky notes. He uses his right hand to take a yellow sticky note from his left hand, on which \"1000\" is written, and carefully places it onto a transparent surface directly in front of him. Several other sticky notes are already adhered to this surface, including one inscribed with \"OUR NET-WORTH,\" another with \"Dead Line,\" one featuring an upward and downward arrow symbol, and one displaying a simple upward-trending line graph.",

    "Scene": "A man in a beige polo shirt and dark pants stands behind a transparent surface, counting money and placing a yellow sticky note with \"1000\" written on it. The video is set in a brightly lit, modern office environment during the day, featuring an open-plan layout with wooden desks, black office chairs, and numerous potted plants of various sizes, contributing to a green and lively atmosphere. Overhead, fluorescent light panels and exposed ventilation pipes are visible. In the foreground, several colorful sticky notes are adhered to the transparent surface, displaying simple drawings like an upward-trending graph and arrows.",
    "Spatial": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at his level. In the foreground, several sticky notes are adhered to a transparent surface: \"OUR NET-WORTH\" is at the bottom left, \"Dead Line\" is to its right, an up/down arrow symbol is near the center, and a line graph is to the right of the arrow. The man, initially counting money, takes a yellow sticky note inscribed with \"1000\" from his hands in the middle ground and moves it forward, placing it onto the transparent surface in the foreground, above and slightly to the right of the arrow symbol and at the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
