  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of two people under an umbrella with a white and black pattern crossing a wet city street at night. Initially, they are positioned slightly towards the right of the center of the frame in the middle ground. As they walk, their position shifts towards the left, with the camera tracking their movement while maintaining them in the middle ground. The umbrella is prominently featured above them. The streetlights and car headlights in the background illuminate the scene, casting reflections on the wet pavement. The buildings line both sides of the street, occupying the left and right edges of the frame, creating a sense of depth. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves smoothly forward and to the left, focusing on the people crossing the street. The individuals continue to walk, moving from the sidewalk onto the crosswalk, while the car's headlights become more prominent in the middle ground. The scene remains consistent with the individuals progressing across the crosswalk, and the car's headlights illuminate the wet street. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the wet pavement reflects the lights from the street lamps and the headlights of an approaching car. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the contrast between the silhouetted figures and the glowing lights, with minimal changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence. The presence of vehicles with illuminated headlights adds a dynamic element, emphasizing the urban setting. The atmosphere is moody, with the rain creating a glossy texture on the road and sidewalks. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and the soft glow of artificial lights.",

    "Subject": "The video features a city street scene during a rainy evening. The main subjects are two people under an umbrella with an alternating pattern of white and black colors, walking across a wet crosswalk. They are dressed in dark clothing. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights and headlights from approaching cars. The scene captures the interplay of light and shadow, with the umbrella and the people standing out against the dimly lit surroundings. The presence of vehicles with illuminated headlights adds a dynamic element, emphasizing the urban setting.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit city street, two individuals holding an umbrella with a white and black pattern walk across a wet crosswalk. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the wet pavement reflects the lights from the street lamps and the headlights of an approaching car. The individuals continue to walk, moving from the sidewalk onto the crosswalk, while the car's headlights become more prominent in the middle ground.

    "Scene": "The video captures a dimly lit urban street scene during a rainy evening. The setting is outdoors, featuring a wide street flanked by tall, dark buildings that create a canyon-like effect. The wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights and headlights, adding a shimmering quality to the scene. Vehicles with illuminated headlights move along the street, while pedestrians holding umbrellas cross at the intersection, their silhouettes outlined against the reflective surface. The atmosphere is moody, with the rain creating a glossy texture on the road and sidewalks. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and the soft glow of artificial lights.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
