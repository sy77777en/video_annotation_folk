  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountain valley landscape with the camera moving forward. The scene is framed by two large, snow-covered mountain ranges in the middle ground, with one occupying the left side of the frame and the other occupying the right. Together, they form a V-shape that directs the view toward the center, where a dark, still body of water is situated in the middle ground, and more distant mountains are visible in the background. The top of the frame is filled by a clear, starry sky in the background. In the bottom right foreground, a patch of snow is visible, cast in a warm, yellowish light. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking into the valley, and it moves forward slowly and smoothly through the scene. This is a time-lapse video shot from a level, aerial perspective, showing the stars moving across the night sky above the snowy mountain valley. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The snow-covered mountains flank the dark body of water, which reflects the celestial light and the dark silhouettes of the mountains. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. The snow is illuminated, creating a stark contrast between bright surfaces and deep shadows. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale, serene atmosphere, and breathtaking beauty of the natural environment. The video features a dynamic, scenic shot as the camera moves forward, offering a breathtaking nighttime view of the snow-covered mountain valley under a clear, star-filled sky.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a majestic mountain valley under a clear, star-filled night sky. Towering, snow-covered mountains flank a dark, still body of water that reflects the celestial light. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. A small, warm artificial light in the foreground provides a subtle contrast to the vast, cold wilderness.

    "Motion": "This video features a dynamic, scenic shot as the camera moves forward, offering a breathtaking nighttime view of a snow-covered mountain valley. A calm body of water rests between the towering peaks under a clear, star-filled sky.",
    "Scene": "This is a nighttime scene of a snow-covered mountain valley under a clear, dark blue sky filled with stars. Two large mountain ranges, their slopes covered in white snow, form a V-shape, framing a dark, still body of water in the center. The water reflects the starlight and the dark silhouettes of the mountains. The snow is illuminated, creating a stark contrast between bright surfaces and deep shadows. In the foreground, a patch of snow on the right is cast in a warm, yellowish light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
