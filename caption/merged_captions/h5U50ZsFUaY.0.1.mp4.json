  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, positioning a person wearing a red long-sleeved top, black pants, and a black helmet in the center-middle ground on the edge of a rocky precipice. They are equipped with a black and blue parachute pack. In the background, a vast, rugged mountain range stretches across the frame under a clear blue sky, with the bright sun positioned in the top left, casting a hazy light over distant peaks and creating long shadows across the steep, rocky terrain. This aerial shot, filmed with a deep focus and mild barrel distortion, captures the person on the mountain cliff. The camera, which is at a continuously varying Dutch angle due to a counter-clockwise roll, initially cranes up. As the person leaps forward off the cliff, initiating a BASE jump, the camera cranes down, shifting from a level to a high-angle perspective to follow their descent. The camera transitions to a high-angle shot, capturing the scene from above as the person descends rapidly along the steep, rocky face of the mountain, deploying their parachute during the descent. The camera maintains a wide shot perspective, capturing the subject's descent against the sheer rock face that fills the scene, with a scree-filled valley visible below. The entire movement is very smooth, providing a dynamic view of the action as the person continues their descent.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a red long-sleeved top, black pants, and a black helmet is shown standing on the edge of a rocky precipice. They are equipped with a black and blue parachute pack. The individual leaps from the cliff, initiating a BASE jump.",
    "Motion": "A person stands on the edge of a rocky precipice, then leaps forward off the cliff equipped with a parachute. The camera transitions to a high-angle shot, capturing the scene from above as the person descends rapidly along the steep, rocky face of the mountain, deploying their parachute during the descent.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, rugged mountain range under a clear blue sky. The bright sun hangs low, casting a hazy light over distant peaks and creating long shadows across the steep, rocky terrain. The camera, initially focused on a person standing on a sharp, craggy cliff edge, tilts sharply downwards to follow the sheer, textured rock face into a deep, scree-filled valley below.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot, positioning a person in the center-middle ground on the edge of a rocky precipice. In the background, a vast mountain range stretches across the frame, with the sun positioned in the top left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
