  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, shows rows of stylized, low-polygon human figures seated in black office chairs at individual computer cubicles within a dark, underground room. The figures, rendered in a faceted white or light gray material, are focused on old, beige CRT monitors with glowing white screens, using black keyboards and mice. Some wear hoodies, while others are depicted in collared shirts. At the start, a figure is seated in the bottom left of the foreground, resting their chin on their hand as they look at the screen, accompanied by two other figures to their right, all working at computers in the same row. In the middle ground, several figures are seated in a row that extends from the left to the right, with more rows visible in the background. The camera, from a high, eye-level perspective, smoothly moves forward and to the right, revealing more of the dark room filled with people at computers. As it moves, the figures initially in the middle ground become more central, and a red cubicle partition enters the frame from the right, occupying the middle ground. The pan reveals additional rows of figures and cubicles on the right side of the room. The entire scene remains sharp due to deep focus, and the figures remain completely motionless throughout. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"China, 2000s\" in a white font.",

    "Motion": "The camera moves forward and to the right, traversing a dark room filled with rows of stylized, low-polygon figures. The figures remain completely motionless, seated in chairs and facing computer monitors within individual cubicles.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, underground room, rows of black computer cubicles are arranged in a grid. Each station is equipped with an old, boxy CRT monitor emitting a bright white glow, a keyboard, and a black office chair. Stylized, white, low-polygon figures are seated at the computers, their forms illuminated by the light from the screens. The camera moves forward and to the right, revealing the extent of the room. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"China, 2000s\" in a white font.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, shows rows of stylized figures in computer cubicles. At the start, a figure is seated in the bottom left of the foreground, accompanied by two other figures to his right, all working at computers in the same row. In the middle ground, several figures are seated in a row that extends from the left to the right. More rows of figures are visible in the background. The camera gradually moves forward and to the right, shifting the composition. As it moves, the figures initially in the middle ground become more central, and a red cubicle partition enters the frame from the right, occupying the middle ground. The pan reveals additional rows of figures and cubicles on the right side of the room."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
