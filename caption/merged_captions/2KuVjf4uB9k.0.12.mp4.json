  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a black sports car with 'Royal Purple' and 'Achilles' branding drifting on a paved track. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the right side of the frame, in the foreground, with the track curving into the middle ground. As the car drifts around a curved section, it produces a large cloud of white smoke from its rear tires, which spreads outwards, filling the lower part of the frame. The car maintains its drift as it moves horizontally across the frame, transitioning from the right side to the center while remaining in the foreground. The surrounding arid landscape, featuring sparse vegetation and dusty terrain, occupies the background. The camera, positioned at an overhead level with a high angle, looks down on the race car, employing a Dutch angle that varies due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly tracks the race car from above, initially trucking left and then moving forward to continue following it, with quick motion speed. The setting appears to be an open, arid landscape, likely during the day, as indicated by the clear visibility and shadows. The environment features a paved track surrounded by sparse vegetation and dusty terrain, typical of a desert or arid region. The car's sleek design and dynamic motion are highlighted as it navigates the curved section of the track, showcasing its agility and power. The transition from the initial to the final position showcases the car's dynamic motion and the track's layout, with the smoke creating a distinct trail on the track. The overall atmosphere is one of speed and precision, with the drone's perspective providing a comprehensive view of the car's path and the expansive landscape.",

    "Subject": "The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" on its body. The car is engaged in a drifting maneuver on a paved track, producing a significant amount of white smoke from its rear tires. The car's sleek design and dynamic motion are highlighted as it navigates a curved section of the track, showcasing its agility and power. The setting appears to be an open, arid landscape, enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action.",
    "Motion": "A black sports car with 'Royal Purple' and 'Achilles' branding is drifting around a curved section of a paved track, producing a large cloud of white smoke from its rear tires. The car maintains its drift as it moves through the curve, with the smoke trailing behind it. The background shows a barren, desert-like landscape with sparse vegetation and a clear sky. The car continues to drift smoothly, with the smoke creating a distinct trail on the track.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a winding racetrack set in a dry, open landscape. The setting is outdoors, likely during the day, as indicated by the clear visibility and shadows. The environment features a paved track surrounded by sparse vegetation and dusty terrain, typical of a desert or arid region. Notable visual elements include a black car drifting around the curves of the track, producing thick white smoke from its tires, which contrasts with the muted earth tones of the surroundings. The car's movement creates dynamic patterns on the track, emphasizing the motion and energy of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of speed and precision, with the drone's perspective providing a comprehensive view of the car's path and the expansive landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a wide shot of a black sports car drifting on a paved track. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the right side of the frame, in the foreground, with the track curving into the middle ground. As the car drifts, it moves horizontally across the frame, transitioning from the right side to the center while remaining in the foreground. The white smoke from the rear tires spreads outwards, filling the lower part of the frame. The surrounding arid landscape occupies the background, with sparse vegetation and dusty terrain visible. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the car, providing an aerial view that effectively tracks the car's movement along the curve. The transition from the initial to the final position showcases the car's dynamic motion and the track's layout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
