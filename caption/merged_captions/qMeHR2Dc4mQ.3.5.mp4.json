  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a man with short, dark curly hair and a light complexion, capturing him from the shoulders up. He has dark eyes, a mustache, and a short beard, and is wearing a dark-colored hoodie with the hood down, making his ears visible. He is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, with his face in the middle of the frame and his head slightly tilted backward. The background is dark and out of focus, placing all emphasis on the subject. The lighting is dim, casting soft shadows on his face, which enhances the visibility of his features and highlights his facial features. The overall composition keeps the subject as the focal point, with no other elements or movements in the frame. The environment is minimalistic, with no visible furniture or props, emphasizing the simplicity and focus on the subject. The camera features a level angle with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face in the foreground. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in on the man's face, maintaining steadiness throughout. The man remains still, with no significant changes in his posture or expression throughout the sequence. His gaze is steady and focused, contributing to a calm and composed appearance. The overall mood is calm and introspective, with no visible movement or changes in the scene. There are no significant changes in the subject's position or the camera angle throughout the sequence. The camera remains at the subject's eye level, maintaining a consistent perspective.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
