  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot capturing a serene winter landscape from a distance, featuring snow-covered trees on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. As the video begins, a snow-covered landscape featuring a house surrounded by tall, snow-laden trees and a majestic, snow-capped mountain in the background is visible. The camera smoothly pans right at a slow speed, revealing more of the house and its surroundings, including additional trees and a swing set in the yard. Rustic wooden buildings are located near the center and slightly to the left and right, placed in the middle ground. The snow-covered ground fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground, with benches situated in the bottom right foreground. As the camera continues to move, more of the snowy environment is revealed, including a swing set located in the right-center middle ground. Majestic mountains rise in the background, spanning the upper part of the frame and providing depth to the scene. The time of day is likely morning or late afternoon, as the light is soft and diffused. The scene includes several dark wooden cabins with white-trimmed windows, nestled among tall evergreen trees and bare deciduous trees, all blanketed in snow. The overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted browns, creating a calm and cohesive winter scene. The scene concludes with a wider view of the area, showing the full extent of the snow-covered landscape, the house, and the swing set, with trees on the right side now in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly pans right at a slow speed, focusing on the snowy landscape and the buildings in the middle ground.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a serene winter environment with snow-covered trees, rustic wooden buildings, and majestic mountains in the background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than any specific object. The snow blankets the ground and trees, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene that emphasizes the beauty and vastness of the landscape. The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature.",

    "Scene": "The video captures a serene winter landscape in an outdoor setting, featuring a snow-covered area with a backdrop of rugged, snow-dusted mountains. The time of day is likely morning or late afternoon, as the light is soft and diffused. The scene includes several dark wooden cabins with white-trimmed windows, nestled among tall evergreen trees and bare deciduous trees, all blanketed in snow. A swing set and some wooden benches are visible, partially covered by snow, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted browns, creating a calm and cohesive winter scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot capturing the winter landscape from a distance. Initially, snow-covered trees on the left side of the frame are positioned in the middle ground, while by the end of the video, trees on the right side are in the foreground. Rustic wooden buildings are located near the center and slightly to the left and right, placed in the middle ground. The snow-covered ground fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground. A swing set is located in the right-center middle ground, and benches are situated in the bottom right foreground. Majestic mountains rise in the background, spanning the upper part of the frame and providing depth to the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level, roughly at the same height as the buildings and trees, maintaining a level perspective throughout the shot. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement during the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
