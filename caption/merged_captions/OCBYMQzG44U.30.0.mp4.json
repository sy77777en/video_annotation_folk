  "merged_caption": "This video showcases a wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, emphasizing the environment with a focus on a large red water slide. Initially, the slide occupies the center foreground and extends into the middle ground. The surrounding area features tiled walls in the background at the top and right, and a tiled floor at the bottom. A metal handrail is visible next to a set of steps in the middle ground on the left. The camera executes a very smooth, slow pan from right to left while simultaneously tilting down, steadily pushing into the central opening of the red slide, which gradually fills the entire frame. The scene is illuminated by a single overhead light, casting a slightly eerie, yellowish-green glow and creating reflections on the wet-looking surfaces. The video features a dynamic shot of the exit of a red water slide, situated in a sterile-looking room with white tiled walls and floors, resembling an indoor pool area. The unusual top-down perspective and distorted geometry make the space itself the primary point of interest rather than any single object within it. The camera's deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, and the mild barrel distortion adds to the unsettling and liminal atmosphere of the environment. A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves through this indoor, tiled area, with the wide, open entrance of the large, solid red water slide positioned in the center, funneling into an enclosed tube. The camera pans left and tilts downward slightly, revealing more of the red water slide and the tiled area below, with a metal handrail visible on the left next to a set of steps.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, eye-level shot features mild barrel distortion and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera executes a very smooth, slow pan from right to left while simultaneously tilting down, revealing more of the red water slide and the tiled area below.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot of an indoor, tiled space resembling a swimming pool area. Viewed from a high, downward-facing angle, a large, bright red water slide with a wide, curved opening occupies the center of the frame, set against walls and a floor covered in small, pale green tiles. The scene is illuminated by a single overhead light, casting a slightly eerie, yellowish-green glow and creating reflections on the wet-looking surfaces. The video lacks a main subject as the focus is on the unsettling and liminal atmosphere of the environment. The unusual top-down perspective and distorted geometry make the space itself the primary point of interest rather than any single object within it.",
    "Motion": "The video features a dynamic shot of the exit of a red water slide. The camera pans from right to left and tilts downward, capturing the slide situated in a sterile-looking room with white tiled walls and floors, resembling an indoor pool area. An overhead light illuminates the scene, which also includes a set of stairs with a metal handrail to the left.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves through an indoor, tiled area. The walls and floor are covered in small, greenish-white square tiles, and a metal handrail is visible on the left next to a set of steps. The scene is illuminated by a round light on the ceiling. Positioned in the center is the wide, open entrance of a large, solid red water slide, which funnels into an enclosed tube. The camera pans left and tilts downward slightly.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
