  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot where a person dressed in white occupies the foreground, centered in the frame, with their back to the camera. This individual is positioned in the foreground, directly facing a large screen that dominates the background. The screen, which takes up most of the frame, displays a close-up of a woman's face, located centrally within the screen's display area. The woman's face is in the background, filling the screen from edge to edge. The person slightly moves their arms while standing still in front of the screen, while the woman on the screen slightly shakes her head during the video. The camera remains completely static, with a level angle view and deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field and consistent perspective. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the small figure in the foreground and the expansive image on the screen behind them. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the interaction between the figure and the screen. The lighting is even, suggesting an artificial indoor setting, and the overall color scheme is predominantly white, with minimal red accents, creating a stark contrast between the figure and the background. The screen displays a close-up of a woman's face, who has short dark hair and is wearing white goggles on her head. The individual appears to be observing the screen, creating a contrast between their small figure and the large, detailed image of the woman's face. The person on the screen wears goggles on their head, and the overall composition remains unchanged throughout the sequence, with no noticeable changes in the shot size or spatial positioning.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
