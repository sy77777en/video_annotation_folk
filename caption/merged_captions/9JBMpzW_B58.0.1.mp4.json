  "merged_caption": "This is a level-angle, extreme wide shot of a seascape at night, captured from a high vantage point on the bow of a large container ship. The bow extends from the bottom foreground to the bottom center middle ground. In the middle ground, the dark ocean stretches to the background, reaching the horizon just below the horizontal center of the frame. The background is dominated by the night sky, which fills the upper portion of the composition. Within this background, dark clouds drift across the frame in a time-lapse, periodically obscuring and then revealing a dense field of stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way. The camera, mounted above the containers and sea surface at a height between overhead and aerial levels, captures this greatly accelerated time-lapse video, showcasing the rotation of the stars and the movement of clouds over the dark sea. The camera appears to be moving forward, adding a dynamic element to the scene, although this is difficult to discern due to the dark environment and time-lapse effect. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the ship's deck to the stars sharp. A faint, ethereal green and yellow glow, possibly airglow, lines the horizon where the dark sea meets the star-filled expanse. The foreground is occupied by the deck of the ship, which is loaded with stacked shipping containers. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" along with social media icons. The composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment, with the ship serving merely as a vantage point, grounding the viewer and highlighting the vastness of the sea and sky.",

    "Camera": "This greatly accelerated time-lapse video captures the night sky from the bow of a cargo ship, with the camera mounted above the containers and sea surface, at a height between overhead and aerial levels. The camera appears to be moving forward, although this is difficult to discern due to the dark environment and time-lapse effect. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the ship's deck to the stars sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a large container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The sky above is a breathtaking celestial display, filled with a dense field of brilliant stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way, partially veiled by dark, drifting clouds. A faint, ethereal green and yellow glow, possibly airglow, lines the horizon where the dark sea meets the star-filled expanse. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The ship serves merely as a vantage point, its presence grounding the viewer and highlighting the vastness of the sea and sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a breathtaking time-lapse video capturing the view from the bow of a large ship sailing on the open ocean at night. The sky above is a spectacular canvas of countless stars and the Milky Way, with clouds drifting across the celestial display. The video showcases the rotation of the stars and the movement of clouds over the dark sea.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on the bow of a large ship, the scene looks out over a dark, calm ocean at night. Above, a vast, star-filled sky, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way, is partially obscured by dark clouds moving in a time-lapse. A faint greenish-yellow glow is visible on the horizon beneath the clouds. The foreground is occupied by the deck of the ship, which is loaded with stacked shipping containers. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" along with social media icons.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
