  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a bird, likely an egret, positioned in the center of the frame, standing in shallow, murky brown water. The bird, with a gray body, black and white wings, and a bright yellow beak with a distinctive black tip, is in the middle ground, oriented upright and slightly moving, causing gentle ripples in the water. Its head is light gray, and it occasionally leans forward, reflecting its natural behavior. The bird flaps its wings vigorously, dipping its head into the water and creating splashes, appearing to be in a playful or bathing behavior. The background consists of a muddy, shallow water area with some scattered debris and a small lump of dark mud visible on the left side of the scene. The water, which occupies the entire frame, extends from the foreground to the middle ground and then to the background, with its calm surface disrupted only by the bird's movements. The camera is positioned above the bird, providing a clear view of the scene from a higher vantage point. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the bird in the midground. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movement, tilting downwards with minimal shaking, capturing the bird's dynamic actions as it splashes water around. The setting is outdoors, focused entirely on this small section of the muddy water body during the daytime.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle view looking down from above, with the camera positioned above water. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on a bird in the midground. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movement, tilting downwards with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a bird standing in shallow water, showcasing a distinctive appearance with a gray body, black and white wings, and a bright yellow beak with a distinctive black tip. Its head is light gray, and the bird is seen wading or moving slightly in the water. While its posture is upright at times, it also leans forward, reflecting its natural behavior in the environment. The water around the bird is calm, with slight ripples indicating gentle movement.",
    "Motion": "The bird, with a yellow beak and gray body, is seen in shallow water, flapping its wings vigorously. It dips its head into the water, creating splashes as it moves. The bird continues to flap its wings and splash water around, appearing to be in a playful or bathing behavior. The background consists of a muddy, shallow water area with some scattered debris and a small rock or root visible on the left side.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a bird with grey, white, and black plumage and a distinct yellow beak and facial marking, standing and bathing in shallow, murky brown water during the daytime. The water has gentle ripples caused by the bird's movements as it splashes. A small lump of dark mud is visible near the bird on the left side of the scene. The setting is outdoors, focused entirely on this small section of the muddy water body.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of a bird, likely an egret, positioned in the center of the frame, standing in shallow water. The bird is in the middle ground, with its body oriented upright and slightly moving, causing gentle ripples in the water. Its position remains relatively stable throughout the video. To the left of the bird, in the middle ground, there is a small lump of dark mud. The water, which occupies the entire frame, extends from the foreground to the middle ground and then to the background, with its calm surface disrupted only by the bird's movements. The camera is positioned above the bird, providing a clear view of the scene from a higher vantage point."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
