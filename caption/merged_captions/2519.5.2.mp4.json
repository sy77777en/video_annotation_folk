  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man with light skin and short, dark hair, capturing him from the chest up. He is wearing a dark jacket over a patterned shirt with a light-colored collar. Positioned slightly to the right in the frame, he occupies the foreground, with his body angled slightly away from the camera. The man exhibits subtle movements throughout the sequence, such as slight head movements and indications of heavy breathing, while maintaining a consistent position in the frame. He turns his head towards his left side, and his posture and facial expression suggest sadness, as if he is on the verge of tears. The background is dark and indistinct, with minimal visible details, emphasizing the subject. A faint beam of light enters from the left side, casting subtle highlights on the man's face and upper body. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, which emphasizes his contemplative demeanor. The camera is at the subject's eye level, providing a direct view of his upper torso and face. The video features a low-angle shot with deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The setting is indoors in a dimly lit room, creating a shadowy and subdued atmosphere. The lighting is minimal, with a faint beam of light cutting through the darkness, highlighting the contours of the scene. The walls and ceiling are dark, possibly wooden, adding to the enclosed and intimate feel of the space. The overall color palette is muted, with deep shadows and soft highlights. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position during the video. The overall composition keeps the focus tightly on the man, with the dimly lit surroundings contributing to a confined and intimate atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He is wearing a dark jacket over a patterned shirt with a light-colored collar. His facial expression appears sad, and he is looking slightly downward. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, which emphasizes his contemplative demeanor. The man is positioned slightly to the right in the frame.",
    "Motion": "The man exhibits noticeable movements, breathing heavily with visible shifts in his head and chest. He turns his head towards his left side. His posture and facial expression suggest sadness, as if he is on the verge of tears.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit room, creating a shadowy and subdued atmosphere. The lighting is minimal, with a faint beam of light cutting through the darkness, highlighting the contours of the scene. The walls and ceiling are dark, possibly wooden, adding to the enclosed and intimate feel of the space. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light, suggesting an isolated environment. The overall color palette is muted, with deep shadows and soft highlights. The setting is simple, with no visible furniture or props, focusing on the ambient mood created by the interplay of light and shadow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
