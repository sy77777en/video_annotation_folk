  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene opens on a vast, dark field at night, illuminated by the intense glare of stadium lights from above. A woman in a white uniform with red knee-high socks is visible in the foreground on the far left of the frame, who soon exits the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, exhibits a shaky, hip-level shot with a level angle and mild barrel distortion. In the middle ground, two women in teal uniforms are positioned, with one further back than the other. The woman in front, wearing a teal athletic top and matching shorts, is bent forward at the waist as she completes a cartwheel. Another woman walks towards her. As the video progresses, two additional women in teal jerseys run towards the woman who just completed the cartwheel, entering from the right side of the frame. The grassy field extends from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, thick, yellowish-white fog or smoke billows across the grassy terrain, catching the light and creating a hazy, dramatic atmosphere. This smoke fills the upper portion of the frame, partially obscuring lights mounted on towers. Initially, stadium lights are visible at the top center and top right of the frame, but due to the camera panning right, they later appear at the top left and top center. Below the smoke, there appears to be a wall marking the boundary of the field. Multiple figures in athletic attire are visible, their forms partially highlighted against the brightly lit smoke in the background, with their colors and details discernible. The video exhibits motion blur, making the camera's focus unclear.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a nighttime scene on a grassy field, illuminated by bright stadium lights. Initially, a woman in a white uniform with red knee-high socks and athletic shoes is seen on the far left, walking out of view. Following this, a woman in the middleground performs a cartwheel, wearing a teal athletic top and matching shorts. She has light skin and her hair appears to be pulled back. Another woman in a similar teal uniform stands further back, with some other players partially obscured behind her. Towards the end of the video, two more women in teal jerseys enter the frame from the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
