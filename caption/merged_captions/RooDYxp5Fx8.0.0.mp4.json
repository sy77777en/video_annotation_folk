  "merged_caption": "This video features a wide, eye-level scenery shot from a first-person perspective of a city street in Kyoto, Japan, on a sunny day. The paved sidewalk extends from the foreground to the background. In the middle ground, a brown building with several signs in Japanese characters and a green delivery tricycle with a purple crate are on the left, the entrance to Gojo Station with a gray, arched roof is in the center, and a silver-gray delivery truck with orange graphics is on the right. The background consists of taller buildings on both the left and right sides of the frame, with a blue sky and white clouds at the top. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk with a slight, natural unsteadiness, suggesting a walking perspective. Pedestrians in face masks walk along the sidewalk, including a masked man walking from the middle ground toward the foreground, moving from the center toward the left. As he nears the camera, another man carrying goods enters from the right foreground and walks across the frame to the left, passing behind the first man. The scene captures the atmosphere and daily life of the city, highlighting the architecture, street activity, and overall vibe of the area. An overlay in the center displays the text \"Kyoto Japan\" in white, with \"3 PM - August, 2021\" appearing underneath.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire street scene sharp. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk with a slight, natural unsteadiness, suggesting a walking perspective.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the atmosphere and daily life of the city rather than a specific object or person. The shot likely serves as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the location, highlighting the architecture, street activity, and overall vibe of the area.",
    "Motion": "This is a handheld shot from a first-person perspective of a city street in Kyoto, Japan, on a sunny day. The scene features the entrance to Gojo subway station, pedestrians on the sidewalk, and a delivery truck parked nearby. People can be seen walking and working in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a daytime street scene in Kyoto, Japan. The perspective is from a paved sidewalk facing the entrance to Gojo Station, which features a gray, arched roof. To the left, a traditional brown building has several signs with Japanese characters, and a green delivery tricycle with a purple crate is parked nearby. On the right, a silver-gray delivery truck with orange graphics is parked, and a multi-story, beige building stands in the background under a blue sky with white clouds. Pedestrians in face masks walk along the sidewalk, including a masked man walking towards the viewer. As he approaches, another man carrying goods enters the scene, moving from the right side of the screen to the left. An overlay in the center displays the text \"Kyoto Japan\" in white, with \"3 PM - August, 2021\" appearing underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
