  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a first-person POV shot, capturing two people walking through an ancient stone passageway. The first person, in an orange top and black trousers, is positioned slightly to the center right and in the middle ground, while the second person, wearing a white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack, is to the right and also in the middle ground. Both individuals occupy the lower half of the frame, emphasizing the towering stone walls in the background. The camera, at eye level, maintains a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field, moving forward slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the video progresses, a third person in a blue and white jacket enters from the lower right, with only the upper body visible, positioned in the foreground. The stone walls, with their rugged textures and visible markings, dominate the upper half of the frame, creating a sense of depth and scale. The passageway narrows as the group moves forward, with the second person gradually moving ahead of the third person. The environment is characterized by large, rugged stone structures, suggesting an ancient or historical site. The ground is paved with interlocking bricks, adding a structured element to the scene. The time of day is late afternoon, indicated by the long shadows cast on the ground and the warm, golden sunlight illuminating the stone surfaces. The overall atmosphere is defined by the interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the visual depth of the stone architecture. The group continues to walk forward, contributing to a sense of movement and exploration, with the camera maintaining a consistent perspective at the subjects' height throughout.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video, filmed from a first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient structure. Initially, the first person, wearing an orange top, black trousers, and carrying a blue backpack, leads the group. The second person, following closely, is dressed in a white hat, a striped shirt, and denim shorts, carrying a red backpack. Later, a third person appears from the lower right of the frame, positioned at the very end, with only his upper body visible, wearing a blue and white jacket. The people occupy only half the frame's height, emphasizing the ancient stone walls and pathway surrounding them.",
    "Motion": "The video shows three individuals walking through a narrow, ancient stone passage with high walls on either side. The first person, wearing an orange top and black pants, leads the group, followed by the second person in a white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack. The third person, wearing a blue and white jacket, appears from the lower right of the frame and follows the group. The pathway is paved with red bricks, and there are shadows cast on the walls, indicating the presence of sunlight. The group continues to walk forward, with the second person gradually moving ahead of the third person.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing an outdoor setting with towering stone walls forming a narrow passageway. The environment is characterized by large, rugged stone structures with visible textures and markings, suggesting an ancient or historical site. The ground is paved with interlocking bricks, adding a structured element to the scene. The time of day is late afternoon, indicated by the long shadows cast on the ground and the warm, golden sunlight illuminating the stone surfaces. The scene includes a few individuals walking through the passage, contributing to a sense of movement and exploration. The overall atmosphere is defined by the interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the visual depth of the stone architecture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
