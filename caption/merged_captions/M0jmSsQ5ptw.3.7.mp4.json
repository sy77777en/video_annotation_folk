  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a high angle on a wide, paved airfield under a partly cloudy sky. A large, complex wooden contraption, resembling a transportation system, dominates the foreground, extending from the bottom left to the center of the frame. It is constructed from light-colored wooden beams and features a ramp, a crane-like arm, and a vertical post. A dark spherical ball rests on a ramp in the bottom left foreground. An asphalt runway stretches from the bottom right foreground to the top left background, disappearing at the horizon. A small, vintage-style biplane is suspended slightly above the center of the frame, with a white bag hanging directly below it. As the boom of the contraption rotates counterclockwise, both the biplane and the bag move. Additionally, the black sphere slides down the track of one of the contraptions and exits the frame. On the left side of the frame, in the middle ground, there is another independent wooden structure with a cantilever. The background features large buildings on the right, possibly a hangar, along with several large, dark, geometric structures and distant mountains on the horizon, all under a partly cloudy sky that fills the top of the frame. This static shot is captured from an eye-level, high-angle perspective, exhibiting mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow slightly outward. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene, from the foreground wooden structure to the background buildings, sharp and clear. The wide-angle perspective captures the expansive environment, emphasizing the scale of the scene rather than focusing on a single subject, establishing the setting and the relationship between the various elements within the vast, open space.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of an airfield under a partly cloudy sky. A large, complex wooden contraption, resembling a transportation system, occupies the foreground on dry, grassy ground beside a wide asphalt runway. A small, vintage-style biplane is suspended from the structure, with a white bag hanging underneath it. The wide-angle perspective captures the expansive environment, including distant buildings and mountains, emphasizing the scale of the scene rather than focusing on a single subject. The focus is on establishing the setting and the relationship between the various elements within the vast, open space.",
    "Motion": "This is a static, wide-angle shot of a large wooden contraption on an airfield, resembling a transportation system rather than a launch system. A model biplane is suspended from the device, with a white bag hanging below it. As the boom of the contraption rotates counterclockwise, both the biplane and the bag move. Additionally, a black sphere slides down the track of one of the contraptions and exits the frame. Airfield buildings and mountains are visible in the distance under a partly cloudy sky.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a wide, paved airfield under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, a large and intricate wooden structure, resembling a transportation machine, dominates the view. It is constructed from light-colored wooden beams and features a ramp, a crane-like arm, and a vertical post. A dark, spherical ball is positioned to slide down a ramp on this structure. Nearby, a separate unit features a small model biplane positioned at the top, with a white bag hanging from a string. The paved runway extends into the distance, flanked by dry, grassy areas. In the background, a large building, possibly a hangar, is visible, along with several large, dark, geometric structures and distant mountains on the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
