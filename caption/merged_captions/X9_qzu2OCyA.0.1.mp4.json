  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, locked-on perspective, the skier, Emma Dahlström, is consistently framed in the center foreground, moving forward down the slope. She wears a black helmet and large, reflective blue ski goggles that obscure her eyes, a black neck gaiter covering the lower half of her face, a red varsity-style jacket with grey sleeves, white stripes on the cuffs and collar, and a white logo on the left chest, along with black ski pants and gloves with yellow and green accents. She is on red and black skis and holds yellow ski poles. The camera leads her from the front, moving backward to track her as she skis forward, with slight unsteadiness and subtle panning left and right to follow her. Her skis move steadily over the groomed snow as she maintains a stable, forward-facing posture, using the ski pole in her right hand to push off the ground once while consistently maintaining her grip on the ski pole in her left hand as she descends the hill. The background scenery scrolls past her, with a ski lift tower initially in the top-left middle ground receding into the background. A high bank of snow extends from the foreground to the midground on the right side of the frame against a bright blue sky. The white snow is marked with corduroy tracks, and the skier's shadow is cast to the left. A text overlay with her name, \"EMMA DAHLSTRÖM,\" is fixed in the bottom-left corner. The skier's position remains static within the frame, while the environment moves relative to her, creating a dynamic sense of forward motion. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, eye-level perspective, the camera leads the skier from the front, moving backward to track her as she skis forward. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the camera pans subtly left and right to follow her. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A woman, identified by the text \"EMMA DAHLSTRÖM,\" is shown skiing. She wears a black helmet and large, reflective blue ski goggles that obscure her eyes. A black neck gaiter covers the lower half of her face. Her outerwear is a red varsity-style jacket with grey sleeves, white stripes on the cuffs and collar, and a white logo on the left chest. She also wears black ski pants and gloves with yellow and green accents. She is on red and black skis and holds yellow ski poles.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a skier glides forward down a groomed snow slope. Her skis move steadily over the snow as she maintains a stable, forward-facing posture. She uses the ski pole in her right hand to push off the ground once, while consistently maintaining her grip on the ski pole in her left hand as she descends the hill.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, the perspective follows a skier moving down a wide, groomed snow slope on a sunny day. The white snow is marked with corduroy tracks, and the skier's shadow is cast to the left. As the skier progresses, the ski lift tower transitions from the midground to the background, with only the base of the tower captured in the video. In the background, a high bank of snow is visible on the right side of the path against a bright blue sky. A white text overlay inside a black box, reading \"EMMA DAHLSTRÖM,\" is positioned in the lower-left portion of the view.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, locked-on perspective, the skier, Emma Dahlström, is consistently framed in the center foreground, moving forward down the slope.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
