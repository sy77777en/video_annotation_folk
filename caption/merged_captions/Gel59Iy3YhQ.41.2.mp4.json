  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot that begins with a close-up of tangled, leafy branches filling the frame. The camera performs a very smooth upward movement, rising from behind the trees to reveal a large, unconventional house perched precariously on a cliff edge. This eccentrically designed structure, complete with a rickety-looking tower and a large sphero-cylinder tank on its roof, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center, surrounded by a dense, misty forest of dark pine trees. In the background, layers of rolling mountains stretch across the frame, fading into a misty valley under a dramatic, warm-toned, cloudy, golden-orange sky at either dawn or dusk. The camera is shot from a level angle with a deep focus, keeping the foreground trees and the background house and mountains sharp. In the final composition, the branches occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while the shot becomes fixed, maintaining the view of the house. Gnarled, brown branches fill the foreground, and birds can be seen flying in the distance.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot from a level angle with a deep focus, keeping the foreground trees and the background house and mountains sharp. The camera performs a very smooth upward movement, rising from behind the trees to reveal a large, unusual house built on a cliff. The shot then becomes fixed, maintaining the view of the house.",
    "Subject": "This video features a dramatic landscape scenery shot that reveals a peculiar, sprawling house from behind a screen of tangled branches. The cobbled-together structure, complete with a rickety-looking tower and a large sphero-cylinder tank on its roof, is perched precariously on a cliff edge overlooking a dense pine forest. In the distance, layers of mountains fade into a misty, golden-hued sky at either dawn or dusk.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot with a slow upward camera movement. The scene reveals a large, eccentrically designed house perched on a cliff edge within a dense, misty forest. In the background, rolling mountains are visible under a dramatic, warm-toned, and cloudy sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a camera rises from behind dense, leafy bushes to reveal a large, unconventional house perched on a cliff edge at either sunset or sunrise. The structure, overlooking a forest of dark pine trees, is a composite of different elements, including a tall, rickety-looking tower and a sphero-cylinder water tank on the roof. In the background, layers of mountains fade into a misty valley under a cloudy, golden-orange sky. Gnarled, brown branches fill the foreground, and birds can be seen flying in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a scenery shot. It begins with a close-up of tangled, leafy branches that fill the frame. The camera then rises, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals a vast landscape. In the final composition, the branches occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A large, unconventional house on a cliff edge is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center, surrounded by a forest. The background is composed of layers of mountains stretching across the frame, with a cloudy, golden sky at the top. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking out over the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
