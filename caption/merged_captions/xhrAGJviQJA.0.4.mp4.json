  "merged_caption": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center-right of the foreground from an initial high-angle perspective. He is snowboarding down a steep, snow-covered mountainside during the day, surrounded by a dense forest of tall, thin coniferous trees, each heavily coated in a thick layer of white snow. The snowy slope extends from the foreground into the background, and the ground is completely covered in untouched powder. The man wears a blue and olive green hooded winter jacket under a black vest-shaped harness, olive green snow pants, a grey beanie with a red stripe, large, dark-lensed ski goggles with an orange and black strap, black gloves, and a black backpack. As he skillfully glides downhill, he carves gentle turns to both the left and right, leaning back and digging the edge of his board into the slope, which has a blue and black design on its surface. This action kicks up a large spray of snow, showcasing impressive control and agility while navigating between snow-covered trees. The camera, attached to him, moves with him, smoothly forward, down, and occasionally shifts slightly to the left and right, tracking his descent through the snowy landscape. A varying Dutch angle is created as the camera rolls with the snowboarder's turns. The camera's height transitions from being positioned above the subject to being at the subject's level, and occasionally, the trees pass by in the foreground as he snowboards past them. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus, and the sky above is bright and overcast.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle, eye-level shot follows a snowboarder from behind. The camera moves smoothly forward, down, and occasionally shifts slightly to the left and right, tracking the subject's descent through the snowy landscape. A varying Dutch angle is created as the camera rolls with the snowboarder's turns. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.",
    "Subject": "A man is snowboarding down a snowy slope, captured from a high-angle, forward-facing perspective. He wears a blue and olive green hooded winter jacket, a black vest-shaped harness in front of his chest, and olive green snow pants. On his head is a grey beanie with a red stripe, and he is wearing large, dark-lensed ski goggles with an orange and black strap. He also has on black gloves and a black backpack. The man is leaning back on his snowboard, which has a blue and black design on its surface, as he carves through the powder, raising up snow.",
    "Motion": "A snowboarder skillfully glides downhill through deep powder snow, carving gentle turns to both the left and right. As he leans back and digs the edge of his board into the slope, he kicks up a large spray of snow, showcasing impressive control and agility while navigating between snow-covered trees.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a snowboarder moving down a steep, snow-covered mountainside during the day. The wide-angle perspective shows the person carving through deep powder snow, which sprays up from the board. The setting is a dense forest of tall, thin coniferous trees, each heavily coated in a thick layer of white snow. The ground is completely covered in untouched powder, and the sky above is bright and overcast. The snowboarder is wearing a blue and green jacket under a black vest-shaped harness, a grey beanie with a red stripe, and goggles with an orange-tinted lens.",
    "Spatial": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center-right of the foreground from an initial high-angle perspective. He is surrounded by snow-covered trees that fill the middle ground and background, occupying the upper and side portions of the frame. The snowy slope extends from the foreground into the background. As the man snowboards forward and down the slope, the camera, which is attached to him, moves with him. Occasionally, the trees pass by in the foreground as he snowboards past them, and the camera's height transitions from being positioned above the subject to being at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
