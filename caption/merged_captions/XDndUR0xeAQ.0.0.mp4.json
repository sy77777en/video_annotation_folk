  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a muscular man with long, wavy, dark red hair and a stylized, angular face is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame. He has a confident smirk, and his eyes are completely white with no visible pupils. He wears a black, short-sleeved shirt. His red boxing glove is prominently displayed on the left side, with its white string extending across the frame to his other hand, which is positioned near the center. The left hand is holding the white string used to tighten the glove around the wrist. The individual is speaking, as indicated by mouth movement, while the rest of the body remains still. The background features a paneled ceiling with two long, white light strips on either side, and the scene is evenly lit. The camera smoothly trucks left, maintaining the close-up view of the man as he continues to speak and adjust the glove.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
