  "merged_caption": "The shot begins with a large, blurry, light-gray object, resembling the back of a humanoid figure, occupying the entire foreground and frame. From a smooth, hip-level position, the camera arcs counterclockwise, moving this object out of the frame to the left. This movement reveals a full shot of a mechanical testing apparatus positioned in the center of the frame against a solid black background. The apparatus features a tall stack of approximately a dozen shiny, black, rectangular weights, supported by two thin vertical metal rods that extend through the stack. These rods are held by two thicker, horizontal, textured metal bars resting on a frame. Below the weights, a transparent, flat sheet rests on two rectangular tubes situated on a black base, with a small, pointed tip extending from the bottom-most weight aimed at the center of the transparent sheet, its reflection visible on the sheet. The stack of weights is suspended in the center, extending from the middle to the top of the frame, while the transparent sheet on a black base sits in the center-bottom of the frame. To the right of the apparatus, a person in a white lab coat stands partially in view, observing the setup. Both the figure and the apparatus are now in the foreground. The camera maintains focus on the testing apparatus, with two partially visible rendered characters slightly blurry. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\". The video begins with a blurry view that appears to show the back of another scientist observing the setup, which then resolves to reveal the entire apparatus.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level position, the camera arcs counterclockwise. The shot begins with the back of a rendered character out of focus as the camera moves past. The focus remains consistent, with two partially visible rendered characters slightly blurry, while the testing apparatus with a stack of weights in the middle stays in focus.",
    "Subject": "The video starts with an out-of-focus view of a rendered figure that seems to be observing a testing apparatus. As the camera shifts past this figure, the apparatus comes into focus. The setup features a tall stack of approximately a dozen shiny, black, rectangular weights, supported by two thin vertical metal rods that extend through the stack. These rods are held by two thicker, horizontal, textured metal bars resting on a frame. Directly beneath the stack is a clear, transparent rectangular sheet, placed on two rectangular tubes situated on a black base. The bottom-most weight has a small, pointed tip aimed at the center of the transparent sheet, and its reflection is visible on the sheet. To the right, a person in a white lab coat stands partially in view, observing the apparatus.",
    "Motion": "The shot begins with a blurry view of a person's back, which is then moved out of the frame by the camera's counterclockwise arc. This movement reveals a stationary testing apparatus, which remains still for the duration of the clip.",
    "Scene": "Set against a solid black background, the scene focuses on a mechanical testing apparatus. A stack of glossy, black rectangular weights is suspended by two vertical metal rods. Below the weights, a transparent, flat sheet rests on two horizontal, textured metal bars, all supported by a black base. A small, pointed tip extends from the bottom of the weight stack, aimed at the center of the transparent sheet. To the right of the apparatus, a figure in white is partially visible. The video begins with a blurry view that appears to show the back of another scientist observing the setup, which then resolves to reveal the entire apparatus. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\".",
    "Spatial": "The shot begins with a large, blurry, light-gray object, resembling the back of a humanoid figure, occupying the entire foreground and frame. As the camera moves, this object exits the frame to the left, revealing a full shot of a testing apparatus positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. A tall stack of black weights is suspended in the center, extending from the middle to the top of the frame. Below the weights, a transparent sheet on a black base sits in the center-bottom of the frame. A person in a white coat is partially visible on the right side of the frame, both figure and object are now in the foreground. A text overlay \"(27)\" is present in the bottom-left corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
