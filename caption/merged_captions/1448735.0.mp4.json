  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The camera maintains a consistent height, likely close to the forest floor, and moves forward through the scene. Tall trees with thick trunks dominate the frame vertically, distributed across the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a sense of depth. The forest floor, visible in the lower part of the frame, features a mix of moss-covered rocks and scattered branches. Sunlight filters through the canopy, illuminating the lush greenery and intricate details of the forest floor, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the tranquil and untouched wilderness. The forward movement of the camera reveals more of the forest's interior, maintaining the focus on the natural setting and ensuring a continuous and immersive experience. The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with thick trunks and a forest floor covered in moss and rocks. As the camera moves forward, the trees and rocks remain in view, with the sunlight filtering through the canopy, creating a serene and lush environment. The camera continues to glide smoothly through the forest, revealing more of the dense foliage and the natural landscape. The movement of the camera provides a continuous view of the forest, highlighting the tranquility and beauty of the natural setting. The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left. Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level. The camera angle is level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest in detail.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
