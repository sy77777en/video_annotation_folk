  "merged_caption": "A woman with light skin and wet, blonde hair is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center foreground on a white surfboard that occupies the bottom of the frame. She is wearing a bright pink bikini top and patterned bikini bottoms. The camera is mounted on the surfboard, providing a locked-on perspective with mild barrel distortion, and is fixed to the board, moving backward to lead-track the surfer from the front. Initially, a wave curls around her in the middle ground, and a distant, tree-covered coastline is visible in the background at the top right under a partly cloudy sky. As she crouches low on the surfboard, extending her arms to her sides for balance, she rides along the face of a large, curling ocean wave. The water is a deep blue-green, with white foam and spray splashing around the board. She leans into a turn, maneuvering on the water as the camera's perspective rotates with the board. During this rotation, the entire frame, which is locked onto the board, rotates approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and the woman remains in the center of the frame, while the background coastline shifts to the top center, and the horizon line becomes vertically oriented along the center of the frame. As the surfer executes a vertical top turn, the camera smoothly rolls 90 degrees clockwise, shifting from a level angle to a high angle and back to a rotated level angle. The video employs a speed ramp effect, alternating between fast and slow motion, and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. White water from the breaking wave splashes around her throughout the motion, creating a large splash of white water around her.",

    "Subject": "A woman with light skin and wet, blonde hair is shown surfing on a white surfboard. She is wearing a bright pink bikini top and patterned bikini bottoms. She is crouched low on the board, balancing with her arms extended out to her sides as she rides a wave, creating a large splash of white water around her. The camera captures a full shot, initially positioned at a level angle, then briefly shifts to a high angle before returning to a level angle, rotated 90 degrees.",
    "Motion": "A woman crouches low on a surfboard, extending her arms to her sides for balance as she rides along the face of a wave. She leans into a turn, maneuvering on the water as the camera's perspective rotates with the board. White water from the breaking wave splashes around her throughout the motion.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, with the camera mounted to the front of a surfboard, captures a ride on a large, curling ocean wave during the day. The water is a deep blue-green, with white foam and spray splashing around the board. In the background, a distant coastline covered in green trees is visible under a partly cloudy sky. A person wearing a pink bikini is balanced on the white surfboard, which is cutting through the water.",
    "Spatial": "A woman is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center foreground on a surfboard that occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera is at her level. Initially, a wave curls around her in the middle ground, and a distant, tree-covered coastline is visible in the background at the top right under a cloudy sky. As she surfs, the entire frame, which is locked onto the board, rotates approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise. During this rotation, the woman remains in the center of the frame, while the background coastline shifts to the top center, and the horizon line becomes vertically oriented along the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
