  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a female video game character with a slender build, wearing a red and black top, dark pants, and a red headpiece over her dark hair, is positioned in the bottom left foreground, running up a reddish-brown hill toward the center. Her legs, from the knees down, glow with a light blue light and appear to be made of a crystalline substance. A long, thin weapon is visible on her back. As she runs, she leaves a trail of small, glowing blue particles. A tall, slender, beige-colored pillar with horizontal brown bands and carved details stands in the center middle ground, while a large, floating, fiery structure resembling an inverted mountain made of orange and yellow crystal hangs in the top right background. Snow-capped mountains span the background beneath a dramatic, cloudy, turquoise-blue sky. The camera, initially at the character's level, follows her as she moves. Upon reaching the crest of the hill, the character jumps forward into the air, moving toward the center of the frame. The camera cranes up, transitioning to a high, aerial angle, and continues to track the character as she performs a forward dash in mid-air, propelling herself toward the tall pillar. Instead of landing, she remains airborne and reaches up with her right hand to grab a flying red and white eagle, allowing her to glide. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping both the character and the fantastical landscape sharp. Various white and red targeting icons appear in the environment, and several overlay elements from a heads-up display, including a white horizontal bar and an icon with the number \"2,\" are at the bottom of the screen.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, tail-tracking shot that follows a character from behind at eye level. As the character runs to the edge of a cliff and jumps, the camera cranes up, transitioning to a high, aerial angle. It continues to track the character as they fly forward. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping both the character and the fantastical landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "A female video game character with a slender build wears a red and black top, dark pants, and a red headpiece over her dark hair. A long, thin weapon is visible on her back. From the knees down, her legs have an atypical appearance, glowing with a light blue light and appearing to be made of a crystalline substance. Also present is a tall, slender, beige-colored pillar with horizontal brown bands and carved details. A large, floating, fiery structure, resembling an inverted mountain made of orange and yellow crystal, hangs in the sky.",
    "Motion": "A female video game character runs up a reddish-brown hill, leaving a trail of small, glowing blue particles. She leaps from the edge of the hill and performs a forward dash in mid-air, propelling herself toward a tall pillar. Instead of landing, she remains airborne and reaches up with her right hand to grab a flying red and white eagle, allowing her to glide.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video is set in a fantastical, hilly landscape with reddish-brown ground and a forest of red, orange, and green trees. In the background, snow-capped mountains are visible beneath a dramatic, cloudy, turquoise-blue sky. A tall, slender, beige stone tower with carved markings stands prominently in the scene, while a massive, fiery, volcanic landmass floats upside down in the sky, with a blue beam of light extending from it toward the ground. Various white and red targeting icons appear in the environment. The scene includes several overlay elements from a heads-up display: a white horizontal bar and an icon with the number \"2\" are at the bottom of the screen. ",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a female character is positioned in the bottom left foreground, running up a hill toward the center. A tall pillar stands in the center middle ground, with a large, fiery, floating structure in the top right background and mountains spanning the background. The camera, initially at the character's level, follows her as she moves. Upon reaching the crest of the hill, the character jumps forward into the air, moving toward the center of the frame. The camera's perspective shifts to a high angle, looking down on the character as she descends toward the ground in the middle ground, with the base of the pillar in front of her."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
