  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, a young man with short, dark hair stands in profile, positioned in the right half of the frame, wearing a red and black horizontally striped long-sleeved shirt and dark-colored glasses. He is surrounded by a forest of tall, bare trees that occupy the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a sense of depth. The background is heavily blurred, with a blue sky visible in the top portion of the frame. The ground, covered in fallen leaves and bright, out-of-focus highlights, is visible in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a level angle and employing an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the person in the midground. The camera smoothly moves left, tracking the subject from the side as the young man walks forward through the forest while occasionally glancing to the side. The scene is set in a sunlit forest during the day, with dark, vertical tree trunks set against a bright blue sky visible through the upper branches. The entire scene is characterized by a soft, blurry focus and a noticeable blue color cast.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
