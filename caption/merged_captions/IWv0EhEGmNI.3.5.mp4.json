  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene opens with the camera angled downwards from a high position, looking at several motionless human figures in combat-style clothing scattered across the rocky middle ground. A modern assault rifle with a holographic sight is held in the bottom right foreground, with a vertical scale HUD element on the far left and an ammo count in the bottom right. The camera starts at an overhead, high-angle position, looking down on the scene. It then moves downward, gradually tilting up until it reaches an eye-level, level-angle view. After landing, it moves forward slightly through a dark, outdoor area, revealing a covered structure and more motionless figures. As it moves, the figures on the ground move to the bottom of the frame, and a pile of sandbags comes into view in the left middle ground. The final framing reveals a semi-enclosed area under a simple roof with faint lights visible in the distance. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and it maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot. The perspective is captured at night through a green-tinted night vision scope, with a heads-up display overlaid on the view. A subtitle at the bottom of the screen displays the text, \"Price: You're clear.\"",

    "Camera": "This video is presented from a first-person shooter (FPS) perspective. The camera starts at an overhead, high-angle position, looking down on the scene. It then moves downward, gradually tilting up until it reaches an eye-level, level-angle view. After landing, it moves forward slightly. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and it maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective through the green-tinted view of night vision, a modern assault rifle with a holographic sight is held in the foreground. In the area ahead, several human figures in combat-style clothing are lying motionless on the dirt ground in various positions. A subtitle at the bottom of the screen displays the text, \"Price: You're clear.\"",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the view initially descends and lands, looking down at several motionless figures on the ground before tilting up and moving forward through a dark, outdoor area, revealing a covered structure and more motionless figures.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a scene at night through a green-tinted night vision scope. The perspective initially looks down at several bodies scattered on the dusty, rocky ground before panning up to reveal a semi-enclosed area under a simple roof. Piled sandbags form a makeshift fortification in this dark, hazy environment, with faint lights visible in the background. The character's rifle, featuring a holographic sight, is held in the foreground. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, with a vertical scale on the left, an ammo count in the bottom right, and a subtitle at the bottom that reads, \"Price: You're clear.\"",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, the scene opens with the camera angled downwards from a high position, looking at several motionless figures scattered across the rocky middle ground. A rifle is held in the bottom right foreground, with a vertical scale HUD element on the far left and an ammo count in the bottom right. The camera descends, lands on the ground, and tilts upward, transitioning the view from looking down to looking forward. As it moves, the figures on the ground move to the bottom of the frame, and a pile of sandbags comes into view in the left middle ground. The final framing reveals a semi-enclosed structure in the background with faint lights visible in the distance."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
