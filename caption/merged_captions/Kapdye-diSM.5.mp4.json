  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot where a red Land Rover Defender 90 with a white roof occupies the left half of the frame in the foreground. The vehicle features a black roof rack, a black mesh grille over the rear side window, black fender flares, and a spare off-road tire on a white steel wheel mounted on the rear door next to a black access ladder. The vehicle has a yellow UK license plate reading \"R614 JGF,\" with the word \"Pooh\" written in white next to it and a small Union Jack flag sticker on the bottom right corner of the rear side of the car. In the middle ground, a black Mercedes-Benz B-Class station wagon with silver multi-spoke wheels is positioned in the center-right, with a silver sedan featuring a blue and white graphic on its rear side door parked behind it. A white sedan is visible further down the street. The camera, held at a level angle, initially moves forward before beginning a counterclockwise arc around the rear of the Land Rover, starting at the vehicle's rear side window and moving toward its back. This movement causes the shot to transition into a full shot, revealing the entire rear of the Land Rover, which now fills the center-left of the frame. As the camera continues its path, the Land Rover remains the primary foreground subject, while the background buildings on the right, tall and light-colored with large windows, become more fully visible across the top of the frame. The scene is captured in a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving along an urban street during the daytime. The unsteady, eye-level shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"The Stradman\" in red and white.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along an urban street during the daytime. The camera walks alongside a red off-road vehicle with a white roof, a roof rack, a rear-mounted ladder, and a large spare tire. The vehicle remains in the frame the entire time, parked on the side of an asphalt road with white painted lines. Along the street, other cars, including a black Mercedes-Benz, are parked in front of tall, light-colored stone buildings with large windows. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"The Stradman\" in red and white.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
