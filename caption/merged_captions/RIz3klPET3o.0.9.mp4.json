  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a minimalist, hand-drawn scene with a small, abstract figure on a sled as the central subject. The figure, composed of a white, blocky body and a white conical hat, sits on a simple gray sled with two runners. The scene is captured from a side-view perspective against a plain, light gray background. Initially, the figure is positioned on the center-right, situated on a long, curved black line that forms a track with curves. In the top right, the number \"38\" and the musical notation \"mp\" are visible. As the figure slides down the curved black line from left to right, moving downwards and then to the left, the camera smoothly tracks the character from the side, initially trucking right with some downward motion. After reaching the end of the line, the sled becomes airborne, flying over several dashed lines. The camera then slightly trucks left to follow the character as they change direction. This causes the text elements to shift to the far left and then exit the frame. Several short, dashed lines appear to the left of the figure, while the text \"/40\" materializes in the bottom center-left. By the end of the clip, the figure is positioned on the center-left, with the track continuing off-screen and a large, C-shaped curve now occupying the right side of the frame. The environment is minimalist, featuring hand-drawn black elements, including the number \"38,\" the notation \"mp,\" and the text \"40,\" resembling a game interface.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, is set against a plain, light gray background. The environment is minimalist, featuring a hand-drawn, continuous black line that forms a track with curves. A small, cartoonish figure on a sled-like vehicle travels along this track. Black, hand-drawn text and numbers, including \"38,\" \"mp,\" and \"40,\" are visible on the screen, resembling a game interface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
