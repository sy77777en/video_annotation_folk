  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a dark-skinned man with cornrows and tattoos on his forehead is shown from the shoulders up, positioned near the bottom right of the frame. He is wearing black sunglasses and a black shirt, framed by the open rear window of a black luxury car with silver trim that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. The camera is static and positioned at eye level, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the car in the foreground. The man leans his head toward the car window and then pulls away, his hand shaking as he appears to speak. Through the car window, two out-of-focus people are visible in the background, positioned to the left of the main subject; one wears a tan jacket, while the other is dressed in darker clothing. In the blurred background, a residential building with white window frames occupies the top left portion of the frame, while the sky with clouds, appearing to be at sunset, occupies the upper-right portion of the frame, casting a warm glow. A partially obscured street sign is visible in the top right. In the background, people sway their bodies from the left to the right of the frame. The scene is set outdoors on a residential street, with the black luxury sedan positioned in the foreground, its rear passenger window down, revealing a portion of the car's light-colored interior and the man with braided hair and dark sunglasses looking out.",

He is wearing black sunglasses and a black shirt and is visible from the shoulders up through the open rear window, which has a silver trim.

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a residential street under a sky that appears closer to sunset, casting a warm glow. A black luxury sedan with a silver chrome trim along its window line is positioned in the foreground. The rear passenger window is down, revealing a portion of the car's light-colored interior and a person with braided hair and dark sunglasses looking out. In the blurred background, two-story residential buildings with white window frames are visible, along with a partially obscured street sign.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
