  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, positioned in the bottom right foreground on green artificial turf. In the middle ground, an out-of-focus red-orange Nike soccer cleat with a silver swoosh is visible to the left of the center, while a bright light shines in the top left background. The scene is set on a green soccer pitch at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights against a dark background. The camera, positioned at ground level and using a shallow depth of field, keeps the ball in sharp focus as it smoothly arcs clockwise around it. The shot transitions to a close-up as the same red-orange cleat enters from the left and moves toward the center to kick the ball. A speed ramp effect is used, transitioning into slow motion at the moment of impact. As the cleat makes contact with the stationary, wet soccer ball, water splashes dramatically from its surface. At the moment of impact in the center of the frame, the ball is propelled out of the shot to the right. The kicking foot continues its upward arc in a follow-through motion, stopping suspended in the air while the other foot remains planted on the turf. The camera remains in a close-up, now focusing on the player's feet, with the planted left foot in the bottom left and the kicking right foot suspended in the center of the frame after its follow-through. The focus shifts exclusively to the person's feet, showing a pair of red-orange cleats and black socks. The camera maintains a position at ground level, level with the subjects, throughout the sequence, capturing the dynamic motion and dramatic splash of water as the ball exits the frame.",

    "Camera": "This ground-level, level-angle shot smoothly arcs clockwise around a soccer ball. The camera, using a shallow depth of field to keep the ball in the foreground in sharp focus, pauses as a person's foot kicks the ball away. The kick is shown with a speed ramp effect, transitioning into slow motion at the moment of impact.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a medium shot of a yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, resting on green artificial turf. The ball features the word \"STRIKE\" and a black Nike swoosh. A red-orange Nike soccer cleat with a silver swoosh enters the frame and kicks the ball in slow motion, causing the water to splash dramatically. During the kick, the focus is on both the person's feet and the soccer ball, and it is only after the ball exits the frame that the focus shifts exclusively to the person's feet, showing a pair of red-orange cleats and black socks. One foot is planted on the ground while the other, the kicking foot, is suspended in the air after the follow-through.",
    "Motion": "A soccer cleat swings into the frame and kicks a stationary, wet soccer ball in slow motion. Upon impact, water splashes off the ball as it is propelled forward and exits the frame. The kicking foot continues its upward arc in a follow-through motion, stopping suspended in the air while the other foot remains planted on the turf.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a green soccer pitch at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights against a dark background. A yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, rests on the turf. A foot wearing a bright red cleat with a silver swoosh makes contact with the ball in slow motion, causing water to spray from its surface upon impact.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
