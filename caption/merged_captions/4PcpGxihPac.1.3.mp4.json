  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot of a person, whose gender is not discernible, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, surrounded by tree trunks and undergrowth in a dark, wooded area at night, completely saturated in a deep red light. A prominent horizontal red lens flare with circular bokeh effects stretches across the middle of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, smoothly zooms in on the person, who remains stationary while aiming a gun forward. This movement causes the shot to tighten, making the person's head, with a pale, mask-like face, the primary focus as it grows larger in the frame, transitioning the shot towards a medium close-up. The image is blurry and dim, making the focus difficult to determine, while the bright red horizontal lens flare crosses the middle of the scene, adding to the intense red haze that obscures the background, where the silhouettes of tree trunks and undergrowth are faintly discernible.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, level-angle shot that zooms in. The image is blurry and dim, making the focus difficult to determine.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a person, whose gender is not discernible, centered in a dark, wooded environment saturated with intense red light. This individual has a pale face and is positioned among tree trunks and branches, aiming a gun forward. A bright red horizontal lens flare crosses the middle of the scene. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms in, making the person's head the primary focus and appear larger in the frame.",
    "Motion": "A person holding a gun remains stationary in a wooded setting. The camera slowly zooms in, causing the person's head to become more prominent in the frame.",
    "Scene": "A dark, wooded area at night is completely saturated in a deep red light. A bright, horizontal red lens flare with several circular bokeh effects stretches across the center of the view. In the background, the silhouettes of tree trunks and undergrowth are faintly discernible. A pale, mask-like face is partially visible in the center, nestled amongst the trees and obscured by the intense red haze.",
    "Spatial": "This video begins with a wide shot of a person positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, surrounded by tree trunks and undergrowth in the background. A prominent horizontal red lens flare with circular bokeh effects is situated in the foreground, stretching across the middle of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly zooms in on the person. This movement causes the shot to tighten, making the person's head the primary focus as it grows larger in the frame, transitioning the shot towards a medium close-up."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
