  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, transitioning to an upside-down high-angle perspective, capturing the action from a first-person, head-mounted camera. The scene is set on a concrete platform covered with reddish-brown dust, scattered with a large pile of rectangular, reddish-orange clay bricks, some broken and stamped with a black \"RKB\" marking. The person's arms are in the foreground, while their legs and feet, clad in blue flip-flops, along with the pile of red bricks, occupy the middle ground. A light-colored bowl filled with wet, gray mortar is positioned in the bottom left, and a smaller green bowl containing a similar substance with a trowel handle sticking out is at the very bottom edge. The camera moves from eye level to hip level as the person bends down, picks up a red brick with a thin white wire wrapped around it from the pile using their right hand, and then supports it with their left hand while still holding it with the right. The person's hands move from the bottom of the frame into the center, picking up a single red brick from the pile. The shot concludes with the hands holding the brick centrally in the foreground, positioned directly above the person's feet. The entire scene is captured in deep focus with a large depth of field, with some slight shaking during the movement. The person, with brown skin, wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt, patterned bottoms, and a black bracelet on their right wrist. The surrounding bricks are of a similar type, many stamped with letters, and a thin white wire is tangled within the pile of bricks.",

    "Camera": "The video maintains a bird's-eye view perspective throughout the scene, capturing the action from a first-person, head-mounted camera. The camera moves from eye level to hip level as the person reaches for and picks up a brick, with some slight shaking during the movement. The entire scene is captured in deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with brown skin is seen bending down amidst a pile of red clay bricks on a dirt floor. The person wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt, patterned bottoms, and blue flip-flops, with a black bracelet on their right wrist. They hold a rectangular red brick, which has a thin wire wrapped around it, in both hands. The surrounding bricks are of a similar type, many stamped with letters, some broken. Near the person's feet is a light-colored, shallow bowl containing a wet, grey mixture resembling mortar, and a smaller green bowl also holding a similar grey substance with a trowel handle sticking out.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person bends down, picks up a red brick with a wire wrapped around it from a pile on the ground using their right hand, and then supports it with their left hand while still holding it with the right.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down at an outdoor work site during the day. The scene is set on a concrete platform covered with reddish-brown dust, scattered with a large pile of rectangular, reddish-orange clay bricks. Several bricks are broken, and multiple bricks have a black \"RKB\" marking stamped on their sides. A shallow, light-colored basin filled with wet, gray mortar sits on the ground next to the bricks, along with a smaller green basin also containing mortar. The person's feet, clad in blue flip-flops, are visible on the ground as their hands pick up a brick from the pile. A thin white wire is tangled within the pile of bricks.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, transitioning to an upside-down high-angle perspective. The scene is framed with the person's arms in the foreground, while their legs and feet, along with a large pile of red bricks, occupy the middle ground. A light-colored bowl is positioned in the bottom left, and a smaller green bowl is at the very bottom edge. The person's hands move from the bottom of the frame into the center, picking up a single red brick from the pile. The shot concludes with the hands holding the brick centrally in the foreground, positioned directly above the person's feet."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
