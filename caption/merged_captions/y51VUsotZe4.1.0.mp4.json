  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a nighttime street scene in black and white. A light-colored, vintage sedan, likely from the 1940s or early 1950s, consistently stays at the center-left of the frame throughout the shot, occupying the middle ground and moving towards the foreground. The car has two bright, round headlights and a prominent, multi-slatted grille. As it advances steadily forward in the center of a dark street, it passes by two vehicles with their headlights on, sequentially. To its left, another light-colored vintage car remains in the middle ground without noticeable forward movement. Further left, a building displays a partially visible sign reading \"RKO THEA,\" which appears to move farther from the camera as the shot progresses but remains partially visible throughout. Rows of streetlights appear as bright, receding dots on both sides of the street, extending into the background. A white lane divider is visible in the center foreground, extending into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, at eye level, and maintains a level angle. It moves backward, leading the car from the front, with this movement being slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera's perspective appears to be from within a moving vehicle, looking forward down a dark road. The overall atmosphere is dark, with the primary illumination coming from the vehicle headlights and the streetlights. The street is lined with other dark vehicles parked along the roadside, and other indistinct lights dot the surrounding dark buildings. Due to the low resolution, the focus type is hard to determine.",

    "Subject": "This black and white video primarily features a light-colored, vintage sedan, likely from the 1940s or early 1950s, driving towards the viewer in the center of a dark street at night. The car has two bright, round headlights and a prominent, multi-slatted grille. As it moves forward, it passes by other light-colored vintage cars with illuminated round headlights. Further left, a building displays a partially visible sign reading \"RKO THEA\". The street is illuminated by rows of streetlights that appear as receding dots of light on both sides, with other dark vehicles parked along the roadside.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a nighttime scene on a city street, rendered in black and white. The camera's perspective appears to be from within a moving vehicle, looking forward down a dark road marked with a white lane divider. Several vintage cars with illuminated headlights are visible, with one light-colored car prominently positioned slightly to the left of center, also moving forward. On the left, a building with a lit sign reading \"RKO THEA\" is partially visible. Rows of streetlights appear as bright, receding dots in the distance, and other indistinct lights dot the surrounding dark buildings. The overall atmosphere is dark, with the primary illumination coming from the vehicle headlights and the streetlights.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
