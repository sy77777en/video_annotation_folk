  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a single, ancient-looking mechanical device positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground of the scene. The device is a rectangular, box-like object made of light gray, weathered metal with a rough, textured surface. It is angled slightly, showing its front and right side, and rests on a surface that extends from the foreground into the background, partially illuminated by a cool, blue-hued light from both the top and front. The front face features two large, circular dials arranged vertically, each detailed with concentric rings of intricate, finely-etched markings and symbols, and a central metallic pointer. A small, circular knob or crank protrudes from the left side of the device. The ancient-looking mechanical device remains still throughout the video, while the pointer on each dial continues to move—the upper dial's pointer circles clockwise, and the lower dial's pointer circles counter-clockwise. The camera is at the subject's level throughout the shot and performs a very smooth, minor counterclockwise arc around the object. The background is entirely black and undefined, too dark to determine the depth of field. An overlay displaying \"[15]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.",

    "Camera": "This level-angle shot features an ancient-looking mechanical device. The camera performs a very smooth, minor counterclockwise arc around the object. The background is too dark to determine the depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A single, ancient-looking mechanical device stands upright against a black background. It is a rectangular, box-like object made of a light gray, weathered metal with a rough, textured surface. The front face features two large, circular dials, one positioned above the other. Each dial is composed of multiple concentric rings with intricate, finely-etched markings and symbols. A metallic pointer extends from the center of each dial. On the left side of the box, a circular knob or crank protrudes. The device is lit from the front and top with a cool, bluish light.",
    "Motion": "The ancient-looking mechanical device remains still throughout the video, while the pointer on each dial continues to move—the upper dial's pointer circles clockwise, and the lower dial's pointer circles counter-clockwise.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space, a rectangular, box-like device with a weathered, metallic texture stands upright. The object is illuminated by a cool, blue-toned light from both the top and front, creating a soft glow on the dark surface it rests on. Its front face features two large, circular dials arranged vertically, each detailed with concentric rings of markings and a central pointer. A small, circular knob protrudes from the left side of the device. An overlay displaying \"[15]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a single, ancient-looking mechanical device positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground of the scene. The device is angled slightly, showing its front and right side. It rests on a surface that extends from the foreground into the background, partially illuminated by a blue-hued light. The camera is at the subject's level throughout the shot and arcs counter-clockwise slightly and smoothly. The background is entirely black and undefined."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
