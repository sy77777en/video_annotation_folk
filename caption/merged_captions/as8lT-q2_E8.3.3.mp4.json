  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a medium-skinned man with short, dark hair, positioned slightly to the left of the center in the foreground, hanging by his hands against a city backdrop. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. His face is contorted in an expression of physical strain as he struggles, pulling his body upward and swinging his legs. A skyscraper occupies the left middle ground, while a large building with a grid of lit windows is on the right middle ground. In the background, more city buildings are visible between the two main structures. The scene is set at night, high above a dense city, with a view framed between towering skyscrapers. To the right, a large, dark office building is illuminated by a grid of hundreds of bright, square windows. To the left and in the distance, other high-rise buildings with lit interiors contribute to the sprawling urban glow. Far below, the faint streaks of red and white lights indicate traffic moving along a city street. As the man struggles and swings his body upward, the framing transitions into a full shot, revealing his entire body moving across the top of the frame. He pulls himself upward slightly, then swings his legs forward and up, hooking them over the beam he is holding. Using this leverage, he climbs upward. He remains in the foreground, while the cityscape stays in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the action, with a deep focus that keeps the entire city scene sharp. The camera moves slightly upward with noticeable shaking, maintaining an aerial-level, level-angle shot.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
