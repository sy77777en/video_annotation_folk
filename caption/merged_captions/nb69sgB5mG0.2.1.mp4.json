  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a young man with light skin and short blond hair, wearing blue patterned swimming briefs, standing in the foreground on the left side of the frame on a diving platform, with the camera at his level. He is barefoot and has a black wristband on each wrist. In the background, spectators are seated on tiered benches in an indoor swimming facility, featuring a diving board with metal railings and a vibrant blue pool. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an artificial lighting setup typical of indoor sports venues. The young man stands with his back to the pool, arms raised above his head, preparing to dive. As he bends his knees and jumps off the platform, the camera smoothly tilts down to a high-angle perspective, tracking his movement as he leaps off the platform. The man performs a series of flips in the air, maintaining a tucked position with his knees drawn towards his chest. As he continues to rotate, his body straightens out, and he extends his arms and legs in a streamlined position. The camera zooms in on the diver during the descent, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking, and the diver becomes larger in the frame as he descends towards the water. He enters the water in the center of the frame with his body fully extended and arms directed downwards towards the water surface, creating a splash that results in ripples and bubbles on the surface. The shot concludes from this overhead viewpoint, capturing the culmination of the dive in slow motion, with the pool's surface and the structured seating area providing context to the focused diving activity.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a diver's jump. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, initially at a level angle, then smoothly tilts down to a high angle to track the diver as they leap off the platform. The camera zooms in on the diver, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking, and the diver becomes larger in the frame as they descend into the water.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors at a swimming facility, featuring a diving platform and a pool. The setting includes a diving board with metal railings and a spectator area with tiered seating. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an artificial lighting setup typical of indoor sports venues. The pool water is a vibrant blue, with ripples and splashes indicating movement. The scene tracks a diver standing poised on the platform to their contact with the water, where a splash marks the entry. The overall atmosphere is focused on the diving activity, with the pool's surface and the structured seating area providing context.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a diver standing in the foreground on the left side of the frame, positioned on a diving platform, with the camera at his level. In the background, spectators are seated on tiered benches. As the diver jumps, he moves from the left towards the center of the frame while descending. The camera smoothly tilts down to a high-angle perspective, tracking the diver's movement as he leaps off the platform. Additionally, the camera zooms in on the diver during the descent. He enters the water in the center of the frame, with the shot concluding from this overhead viewpoint."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
