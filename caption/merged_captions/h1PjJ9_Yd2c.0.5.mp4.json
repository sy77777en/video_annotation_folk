  "merged_caption": "In a static wide shot, a young woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a ponytail sits on a wooden bench in the lower-left quadrant of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a dimly lit hallway. She is shown in profile, looking toward the right side of the scene, wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, with her hands resting on her lap. The hallway is framed by a light brown brick wall with metal coat hooks on the left in the middle ground and another brick wall in the foreground on the right. A door with a small window is located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A central doorway provides a view into a hazy or steamy locker room in the background, where light filters through two high windows. Inside the room, a towel hangs from a rack over a long bench, upon which some bags are placed. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject, maintaining an overall level angle, and uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground, specifically on the person sitting on the left side of the frame and the door on the right side of the frame. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. The young woman sits quietly on the bench, maintaining her profile view as she looks toward the doorway on the right. After a moment, she begins speaking as if talking to herself, with her hands resting on her legs, which are shaking. A light source from outside the door on the right side of the frame illuminates the wall beside her, highlighting the row of coat hooks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
