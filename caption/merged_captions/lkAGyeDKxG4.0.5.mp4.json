  "merged_caption": "In a wide, top-down aerial shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame, walking along a narrow path that runs vertically through the scene. The individual is dressed in dark clothing, including a black vest and shorts, and appears to be carrying a backpack. The path they are on is flanked by fields of dry, tan grass on both sides, with a narrow, dark-watered ditch to the right of the path. A ditch is located in the center-right of the frame, running parallel to the right of the path. The camera tracks the person as they walk forward toward the top of the frame, maintaining their central position. The camera is positioned directly above the subject. This is a smooth, aerial, bird's-eye view shot that moves forward, tracking a person walking along a dirt path. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The video is filmed by a drone, providing a top-down aerial perspective of a vast, flat landscape covered in textured, dry, brownish-yellow grass. A straight, narrow dirt path bisects the scene vertically. To the right of the path, a narrow, dry, dark-watered ditch with irregular banks meanders through the field. The person walks steadily along a straight, narrow dirt path through a field of dry grass. The individual maintains a consistent pace, moving forward in a straight line.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
