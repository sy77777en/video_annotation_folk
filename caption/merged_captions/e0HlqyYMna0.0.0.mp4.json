  "merged_caption": "Initially, the skier is framed in a medium shot in the center and right foreground, with the majority of the frame presenting a wide shot of a vast, snowy mountain landscape under a clear blue sky. The immediate slope initially descends from the bottom, but as the skier turns and the camera moves, it eventually descends from the top right. Distant mountains and a valley containing a body of water are visible in the top left and top center background at first, but as the camera moves, they are only visible in the top left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, providing a forward-looking perspective from a high angle. As the skier begins to descend, they move toward the lower part of the frame and occupy a smaller space within it. The camera simultaneously follows the skier from a view above their path, with their shadow appearing on the snow in the foreground to their right. Initially, the camera is positioned at the subject's level and then changes to a position above the subject. The video is filmed from a high, Dutch angle on a snowy mountain, with the camera positioned at roughly eye-level relative to the skier, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. Using a deep focus that keeps the vast landscape sharp, the camera smoothly tracks the skier from their rear-side, moving steadily left and downward as the skier descends. This causes the subject to become smaller in the frame, and the camera rolls slightly clockwise at the very end. The skier, wearing a black helmet with a white rectangular strap buckle on the back and a green circular logo on the front, is dressed in a hooded jacket with a colorful abstract pattern in shades of purple, pink, and blue, and is carrying a black backpack.",

    "Subject": "This video features a person, presumably a skier or snowboarder, sliding down a steep snowy mountain. The individual is seen from the waist up, wearing a black helmet with a white rectangular strap buckle on the back and a green circular logo on the front. They are dressed in a hooded jacket with a colorful abstract pattern in shades of purple, pink, and blue, and are carrying a black backpack.",
    "Motion": "A camera positioned behind captures a person sliding rapidly down a steep, snow-covered mountain face, executing a smooth turn during the fast-paced descent.",
    "Scene": "A video captures a daytime scene in a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a clear blue sky. The footage follows a person wearing a multi-colored jacket in shades of purple and blue, along with a black helmet, as they move down a steep, snowy slope. The mountainside features some exposed rocky outcrops and existing tracks in the snow. In the distance, a wide valley containing a body of water is visible between the surrounding peaks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
