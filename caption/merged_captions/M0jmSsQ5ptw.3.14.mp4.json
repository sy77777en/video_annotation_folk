  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot featuring a long, white, cylindrical object suspended in the upper-left foreground on a thin cable that stretches across a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky. The paved ground is visible in the foreground, extending into part of the middle ground and occupying the bottom half of the frame. A yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned in the middle ground on the right, next to a tall black barrier that extends toward the center. In the middle ground, a field of dry grass serves as a separator between the paved area and the distant buildings and mountain range. From an eye-level, level angle, the handheld camera unsteadily trucks left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to the cable system, while slightly panning left to maintain focus as the white cylindrical object on the cable rapidly moves leftward. The scene transitions to a low-angle wide shot focused on a different subject. In this new framing, a light-colored vertical support post occupies the foreground, rising from the bottom-center of the frame. A sloped metal channel is visible at the top of the post, and a black spherical object rolls down it from the top-center toward the bottom-left, colliding with a black device. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner. The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field, and the background shifts from a distant landscape to primarily the cloudy sky, revealing a closer view of the pulley system against the sky.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle, the handheld camera unsteadily trucks left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to a cable system, while slightly panning left to maintain focus as it continues tracking a black ball rolling down a narrow slope.

    "Subject": "The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the middle ground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier and moves leftward. The handheld camera unsteadily moves left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to a cable system, while slightly panning left. The camera then shifts focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post supporting a sloped metal channel, within which a black spherical object is rolling downward. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.",
    "Motion": "The handheld camera unsteadily moves left, dynamically following a large yellow metal frame connected to a cable system and a white cylindrical object on the cable rapidly moving leftward. It slightly pans left to maintain focus while tracking a black ball rolling down a narrow slope and colliding with a black device. ",
    "Scene": "Set outdoors on a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, the scene features a long cable stretched across the area. A white, cylindrical object is suspended from this cable. To the right, a yellow metal structure and a light-colored wooden post with a chain mechanism act as supports, positioned next to a long black wall. In the middle ground, a field of dry grass serves as a separator between the paved area and the distant buildings and mountain range. The handheld camera moves unsteadily to the left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to the cable system, while also slightly panning left. The perspective follows the cable to the top of the support post, revealing a closer view of the pulley system against the sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
