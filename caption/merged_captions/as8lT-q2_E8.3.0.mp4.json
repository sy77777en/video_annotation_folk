  "merged_caption": "This clip begins with a medium-full shot of a young, light-skinned man with short, buzzed hair standing in the center middle ground of a restaurant aisle. He wears a dark bomber-style jacket with details on the shoulders and dark pants. To his right and slightly behind him, a woman with dark hair in a bright blue top is seated in a booth on the left side of the frame. In the right foreground, an older, light-skinned man with glasses and light-colored hair is partially visible, wearing a light-colored collared shirt. Two other women are seated at a table in the center middle ground; one has short, curly, light-colored hair, and the other has short, dark hair. The scene is set inside a diner at night, illuminated by vibrant pink and blue neon tube lights that line the ceiling and windows, with a neon sign reading \"COLONNADE\" visible in the background. The interior features red upholstered booths separated by etched glass partitions with circular patterns. Through the large windows, the dark exterior is punctuated by distant city lights. The man in the center sways his body before stepping up onto the sofa of a red booth and then stands on the tabletop. As he rises, the camera, positioned at his level, smoothly tilts upward and pans to the left to track his movement, transitioning to a low-angle perspective. This action keeps him centered in a medium-full shot as he becomes elevated. The pan to the left brings a woman with long black hair and glasses into view in the bottom left foreground and moves the older man from the right foreground out of the frame. The scene is captured with a deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field.",

    "Camera": "From an initial eye-level, level-angle position, the camera smoothly tilts up and pans left to track a man in a black jacket as he stands on the booth's table. This movement transitions the camera to a low-angle perspective. The scene is captured with a deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, buzzed hair is the central figure in a restaurant. He wears a dark bomber-style jacket with details on the shoulders and dark pants. He initially stands in an aisle before stepping up onto the surface of a red booth's table. Surrounding him are several other patrons who are all looking at him. To the left, a woman with dark hair sits in a booth wearing a bright blue top. To the right, an older, light-skinned man with glasses and light-colored hair sits at a table, wearing a light-colored collared shirt. In the background, two other women are seated at a table; one has short, curly, light-colored hair, and the other has short, dark hair. As the camera pans to the left, a fifth person is revealed: a woman with long black hair and glasses.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
