  "merged_caption": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features, including a large, bushy tail and elongated ears, in a minimalistic indoor setting with a grid-patterned floor and a plain backdrop. The fox is dynamically moving across the space, initially positioned near the bottom center, interacting with a bamboo dragonfly. At the beginning, the fox stands on its hind legs and blows on the bamboo dragonfly, causing it to spin and float briefly. As the video progresses, the fox floats in the air, moving back and forth between the left and right sides of the frame, reaching the left and right-center, as well as part of the top, while maintaining its interaction with the dragonfly. Its large, bushy tail and elongated ears enhance its dynamic movements. The fox then descends back towards the bottom center, stands on its hind legs again, and blows on the bamboo dragonfly once more, continuing its playful movements. The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, with its limbs extended in a playful pose. The setting is devoid of detailed features, focusing on the character's dynamic movement, and the overall style is simplistic, with a monochromatic color scheme that highlights the character's movements against the stark backdrop. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the full range of motion without any noticeable changes in angle or perspective. The grid-patterned floor provides a consistent reference point for the fox's movements, while the plain backdrop remains static, emphasizing the character's actions.",

    "Motion": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated features engaging in a playful interaction with a bamboo dragonfly. At the beginning, the fox stands on its hind legs and blows on the bamboo dragonfly, causing it to spin and float briefly. As the scene progresses, the fox moves back and forth between the right and left, maintaining its focus on the dragonfly. Its large, bushy tail and elongated ears enhance its dynamic movements. Eventually, the fox descends from the right side of the frame to the bottom center, stands on its hind legs again, and blows on the bamboo dragonfly once more. The setting is a simple, open space, allowing the fox's agile and expressive actions to be the focal point.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
