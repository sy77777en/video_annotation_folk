  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a vibrant underwater scene with various marine life and coral formations. In the foreground, several fish, including those with black and white stripes and darker hues, swim among the corals, which display a range of colors and textures. These fish are primarily positioned in the bottom left and center of the frame, moving gracefully through the scene. The corals, with branching structures in the center and bulbous formations in the top right, also occupy the foreground and middle ground. A swarm of fish can also be seen swimming in the background. The camera is underwater at a low angle, looking up from below, using deep focus with a large depth of field to capture the coral and fish clearly. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking. The fish continue to swim around the corals, occasionally interacting with each other and the coral structures. The clear water and sunlight enhance the vivid colors and details of the scene, creating a lively and dynamic underwater environment. The setting is outdoors beneath the ocean's surface, showcasing a diverse array of coral formations and marine life. The corals display a variety of colors, including russet, white, and shades of brown, with intricate textures and branching shapes. The overall atmosphere is serene and colorful, highlighting the natural beauty of the underwater ecosystem. The background is a deep blue, indicating the depth of the water. The fish move gracefully among the corals, creating a dynamic and lively underwater environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
