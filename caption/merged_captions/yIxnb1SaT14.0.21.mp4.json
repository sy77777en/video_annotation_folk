  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a Parisian street corner at night, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. In the left middle ground, a building stands next to an illuminated Christmas tree, while a larger building featuring a prominent golden sunburst sculpture occupies the right middle ground. The Vendôme Column is visible in the left center background. The scene is captured using a time-lapse, long-exposure technique, which blurs the movement of traffic into vibrant red and white light trails that sweep across the bottom of the frame, almost spanning the foreground and middle ground. A few pedestrians are positioned in the left middle ground near the tree. The camera is set at a standard height, filmed from a level-angle, eye-level perspective, and moves smoothly to the right, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The wet pavement reflects the ambient light from ornate streetlights and buildings, enhancing the festive atmosphere. A street sign for Rue Saint-Honoré helps identify the location, and the scene is imbued with a lively pulse, emphasized by the dynamic energy of the blurred elements like cars and people. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a city street at night, filmed from a level-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera moves smoothly to the right, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a vibrant cityscape time-lapse of a Parisian street corner at night, likely near Place Vendôme, identifiable by the prominent column in the background. The scene is imbued with a festive atmosphere, featuring a glowing Christmas tree on a corner and grand, historic buildings with warmly lit windows, one of which is adorned with a massive, golden sunburst sculpture. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique intentionally blurs individual elements like cars and people to emphasize the overall environment and its dynamic energy. This is achieved through the long exposure, which transforms the movement of traffic into brilliant red and white light trails that streak across the reflective pavement, creating a visual spectacle that makes the city's lively pulse the true focus of the shot.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a festive night scene on a street corner in Paris, identifiable by the street signs and architecture. A brightly lit Christmas tree stands on the left, while an ornate building on the right is adorned with a large, golden sunburst decoration. The scene is captured using a long-exposure technique, which blurs the movement of traffic into vibrant light trails.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse, long-exposure shot captures a bustling street corner in Paris at night, identified by a street sign for Rue Saint-Honoré and the Vendôme Column visible in the background. The scene is festively decorated with a large, brightly lit green Christmas tree on the left sidewalk. A prominent building on the right features an elaborate, illuminated golden sunburst sculpture on its facade. The wet pavement reflects the ambient light from ornate streetlights and buildings. The movement of vehicles is rendered as dynamic red and white light trails that sweep across the road. A few pedestrians stand on the corner. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot captures a Parisian street corner at night, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
