  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a Japanese town street on a clear, sunny day. Initially, a two-story building with a mustard-colored facade, a red awning, and a traditional tiled roof occupies the top-left and center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, with a smaller wooden structure in front of it at the bottom-left middle ground. The camera, positioned at approximately eye level, begins by facing this traditional Japanese building before moving rightward along the opposite side of the street. As it moves, it pans right and tilts down slightly to align its view with the direction of travel, revealing the full length of the street, which extends from the bottom of the frame into the center background. This movement brings more buildings into view on the right side in the middle ground, a white sedan driving towards the camera in the center-middle ground, and a tree-covered mountain in the distant background on the right. The paved street is lined with other buildings, and a white van is parked near a stone wall and a small covered structure on the left side of the street. A few pedestrians are visible walking in the middle ground, with one pedestrian walking in the foreground. The scene is brightly lit by the sun, which casts long shadows across the road. In the distance, a lush green mountain rises against a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is deliberately placed on the environment itself, capturing the peaceful atmosphere and architectural charm of the location rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The slow pan across the setting serves to immerse the viewer in the scale and ambiance of the place.",

    "Scene": "A slow pan to the right reveals a street in a Japanese town under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. On the left is a two-story building with a mustard-colored upper facade, a red awning, and a traditional tiled roof. In front of it, a smaller, single-story wooden structure with a dark tiled roof sits at the edge of the sidewalk. The paved street is lined with other buildings, and a white van is parked near a stone wall and a small covered structure on the left side of the street. A few pedestrians walk along the sidewalks. In the distance, a tree-covered mountain is visible. The scene is brightly lit by the sun, which casts long shadows across the road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
