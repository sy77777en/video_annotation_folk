  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned hallway, capturing the full length and breadth of the corridor. The camera begins at ground level, then transitions to hip level, maintaining a level angle throughout. The graffiti-covered walls occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. On the right side, large windows extend from the upper corner of the foreground to the background, allowing natural light to enter. The floor, marked with cracks and debris, spans the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background, with some debris visible in the foreground at the lower left corner. A pile of rubble is located midway down the corridor, situated in the middle ground center. The ceiling, showing signs of wear, is situated at the top of the frame, running continuously from the foreground to the background. The camera drone employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field as it smoothly flies forward with a slight upward movement, capturing the graffiti-covered corridor. As the camera moves forward, more details of the corridor become visible, including broken windows and more graffiti. The perspective shifts slightly, maintaining the same shot size while bringing different sections of the hallway into clearer view. The corridor appears to be in a state of disrepair, with some sections of the floor and walls showing significant wear and tear, including peeling paint and additional graffiti. The initial and final states of the shot remain consistent in terms of framing, with the camera steadily advancing through the corridor, revealing more debris and a pile of rubble along the hallway. The overall mood is one of neglect and abandonment, emphasizing the scale and emptiness of the space.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera drone at ground level, then transitions to hip level. It maintains a level angle throughout. The camera drone employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The drone camera smoothly flies forward with a slight upward movement, capturing the graffiti-covered corridor.",
    "Subject": "The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned hallway. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The hallway is long and narrow, with walls covered in colorful graffiti, adding a sense of urban decay. The ceiling and floor show signs of wear, with debris scattered throughout. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to filter in, highlighting the dilapidated state. The overall mood is one of neglect and abandonment, emphasizing the scale and emptiness of the space.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a long, abandoned corridor with yellowish walls covered in various graffiti and tags. The floor is dirty and scattered with debris, and the corridor is lined with windows on the right side, allowing some natural light to filter in. As the camera moves forward, more details of the corridor become visible, including broken windows and more graffiti. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more debris and damage along the walls, including peeling paint and additional graffiti. The corridor appears to be in a state of disrepair, with some sections of the floor and walls showing significant wear and tear. The camera moves further down the corridor, showing more debris and a pile of rubble along the hallway.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a long, narrow corridor in an abandoned building, characterized by its deteriorating condition and graffiti-covered walls. The setting is indoors, with large windows on one side allowing natural light to filter in, casting a muted glow over the scene. The walls are adorned with colorful graffiti, featuring various shapes and markings, adding a chaotic yet vibrant element to the otherwise decaying environment. The floor is cracked and littered with debris, leading to a pile of rubble located midway down the corridor. The ceiling shows signs of wear, with peeling paint and exposed materials. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and abandonment, with the corridor stretching into the distance, emphasizing the building's desolate state.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned hallway, capturing the full length and breadth of the corridor.

On the right side, large windows extend from the upper corner of the foreground to the background, allowing natural light to enter. The floor, marked with cracks and debris, spans the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background, with some debris visible in the foreground at the lower left corner.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
