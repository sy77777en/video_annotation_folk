  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level, showing a vintage silver and black SLR camera with a black lens in the center middle ground on a wooden surface, illuminated by a spotlight from above. A red and white rectangular mini fridge with a glass door stands vertically in the background directly behind the camera, featuring the words \"ICE COLD\" in white lettering on a red vertical stripe, with a signature in red lettering on the white horizontal stripe. Potted plants with dark green leaves in dark-colored pots flank the scene on the left and right, along with other indistinguishable objects due to the lack of light. The video begins with a rapid forward movement of the camera at a level angle, initially out of focus, accompanied by noticeable shaking. As the camera eventually becomes stationary, the shot transitions to a shallow depth of field, highlighting the camera in the foreground while the surroundings remain static and peaceful. The shot then transitions to a full shot, bringing the subjects closer to the viewer, as large, yellow, sans-serif capital letters spelling \"THE FILM LOOK\" appear as a yellow overlay, positioned centrally over the red and white mini fridge and above the camera. The final composition maintains this central framing, with the camera and text as the primary focal points. A potted plant is cast in deep shadow in the top right corner.",

    "Camera": "The camera moves forward quickly from a level angle, initially out of focus, then transitions to a shallow depth of field with the foreground remaining sharp, despite noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "A silver and black vintage SLR camera with a black lens is positioned centrally on a wooden surface, illuminated by a spotlight from above. Behind the camera, a red and white rectangular mini fridge with a glass door stands vertically, featuring the words \"ICE COLD\" in white lettering on a red vertical stripe, with a signature in red lettering on the white horizontal stripe. To the right of these central items are potted plants with dark green leaves in dark-colored pots, along with other indistinguishable objects due to the lack of light. Large, yellow, sans-serif capital letters spelling \"THE FILM LOOK\" are superimposed over the red and white object and positioned above the camera.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a rapid forward movement of the camera at a level angle, accompanied by noticeable shaking. As the camera eventually becomes stationary, the shaking continues. Initially out of focus, the shot transitions to a shallow depth of field, highlighting the camera in the foreground while the surroundings remain static and peaceful.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a single spotlight from above illuminates a wooden surface. Centered in the light is a vintage silver and black SLR camera. Behind it, a red and white mini fridge with the words \"ICE COLD\" and a partially visible signature is partially visible. A potted plant is cast in deep shadow in the top right corner. The text \"THE FILM LOOK\" appears as a yellow overlay, positioned centrally over the camera.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level, showing a vintage camera in the center middle ground on a wooden surface. A red and white mini fridge is positioned in the background directly behind the camera, flanked by potted plants on the left and right. The shot then transitions to a full shot, bringing the subjects closer to the viewer, as large yellow text appears in the top center, superimposed over the mini fridge and above the camera. The final composition maintains this central framing, with the camera and text as the primary focal points."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
