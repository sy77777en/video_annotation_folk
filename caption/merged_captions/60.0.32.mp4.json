  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a woman in a dynamic action pose, mid-air in a stadium setting. She is positioned centrally in the frame, with the stadium and spectators forming the background. The camera captures her from a low angle, emphasizing her leap against the clear sky. The woman, with dark skin and black hair tied back, is wearing a blue soccer jersey with the number 9, white shorts, and red socks, suggesting she is playing soccer. The camera smoothly pulls backward, revealing that the initial low-angle shot of the soccer player is actually a dynamic image within a picture frame resting on a table. The content within the frame continuously rotates as the camera pulls back. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom, where a close-up shot focuses on a wooden bedside table. The table is arranged with a framed photo of the woman in action prominently placed in the center of the entire frame, a white lamp on the left, and an alarm clock on the right. The background features softly lit string lights and a plush toy on a bed with light green sheets, creating a warm atmosphere. The transition links the dynamic outdoor action with the intimate indoor setting, enhancing the overall aesthetic.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
