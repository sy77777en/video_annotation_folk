  "merged_caption": "A static wide shot captures three presenters in a television studio. In the foreground, a man stands on the left, a woman in a patterned top is in the center-left, and a woman in a blue dress is on the right. The man on the left, who is white and middle-aged with short grey hair, is wearing a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a light-colored tie. He gestures with his hands while speaking, his face expressive and smiling. Beside him, the woman with long, dark brown hair and tan skin throws her head back and laughs, wearing a sleeveless, patterned top and a black skirt. The woman on the right, a Black woman with short, dark hair, stands still with her hands clasped, smiling, in a bright blue, sleeveless dress. Behind them, a large video wall in the middle ground displays a high-angle view of a sprawling desert landscape, showing a mix of developed areas and reddish-brown earth. The sky in the image is divided, with one section showing clear blue with sun rays and another filled with dark, dramatic clouds. The text \"ARIZONA'S WEATHER AUTHORITY\" is overlaid on the center of the scene. The physical studio set, featuring horizontal wooden slats with orange backlighting, occupies the background. The camera remains completely static throughout the shot, positioned at an eye-level height and a level angle, using deep focus to keep all three news anchors and the background screen in sharp detail. The man then gestures with both hands and laughs as well, while the woman in the center-left continues to laugh and move her upper body. The woman on the right remains relatively stationary.",

    "Scene": "A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures an indoor news studio, where three presenters stand before a large, multi-panel video wall. The backdrop displays a high-angle view of a sprawling desert landscape, showing a mix of developed areas and reddish-brown earth. The sky in the image is divided, with one section showing clear blue with sun rays and another filled with dark, dramatic clouds. The text \"ARIZONA'S WEATHER AUTHORITY\" is overlaid on the center of the scene. The physical set surrounding the video screen consists of horizontal wooden slats with integrated warm, orange backlighting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
