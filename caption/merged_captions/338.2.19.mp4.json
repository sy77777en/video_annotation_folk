  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a woman with medium-length dark hair, wearing thin-framed glasses and a teal top, suggesting she might be wearing denim overalls. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. She is positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground, with floral-patterned wallpaper and a framed picture in the background. The camera is at her eye level, providing a direct view of her face and upper body. The setting is a warmly lit room, creating a cozy, intimate environment with a homely feel. The lighting highlights her facial features, contributing to the calm atmosphere. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining a level angle and a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in focus without any shaking. The shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more tightly on her face and upper shoulders. In this close-up, her 2D position remains central, but the background elements become less prominent due to the tighter framing. The camera maintains its position at her eye level throughout the transition. The overall composition remains consistent, focusing on the woman within this domestic setting.",

    "Subject": "The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair, wearing thin-framed glasses. She is dressed in a teal top, and a strap over her shoulder suggests she might be wearing denim overalls. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The lighting highlights her facial features, and she appears to be in a calm, indoor setting.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a woman standing in a room with floral wallpaper and a framed picture on the wall. The camera gradually moves forward towards her as she remains still, looking straight ahead.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors, featuring a warmly lit room with floral-patterned wallpaper and a framed picture on the wall. The setting suggests a cozy, intimate environment. The lighting is soft, creating a calm atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a teal top and glasses, positioned centrally in the scene. The background includes subtle decorative elements, contributing to the room's homely feel. The overall composition remains consistent, focusing on the person within this domestic setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the woman, capturing her from the chest up. She is positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. Her 2D position is directly in the center, while her 3D position places her in the foreground, with the floral-patterned wallpaper and framed picture in the background. The camera is at her eye level, providing a direct view of her face and upper body. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more tightly on her face and upper shoulders. In this close-up, her 2D position remains central, but the background elements become less prominent due to the tighter framing. The camera maintains its position at her eye level throughout the transition. There are no other significant changes in spatial positioning or camera height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
