  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a large African elephant with dark brown, wrinkled skin stands in the left-middle ground, partially obscured by thorny green bushes and dry, pale-yellow grass that occupy the foreground and bottom of the frame. The elephant is oriented towards the right with its head lowered, foraging for food in the savanna vegetation. Its large, floppy ears are a prominent feature, and both white tusks are visible, although frequently obscured by the tall grasses. The scene is set in an outdoor, arid savanna under soft, warm light, characterized by a mix of dry grass and dense bushes. In the background, scattered, thin-trunked trees with sparse foliage are visible. The camera is positioned at the elephant's level, using deep focus to maintain a large depth of field in focus, and the framing is slightly unsteady throughout the clip. The elephant makes subtle movements with its head and trunk as it chews, and its large right ear moves gently. The camera's slightly unsteady shot, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, captures these movements, providing a temporally coherent narrative of the elephant's foraging behavior amidst the savanna landscape.",

    "Subject": "A large African elephant with dark brown, wrinkled skin stands on the left side of the scene, partially obscured by tall, dry grass and green, thorny bushes. The elephant is oriented towards the right with its head lowered, and its large, floppy ears are a prominent feature. Both white tusks are visible, although they are frequently obscured by the tall grasses, as it appears to forage in the savanna vegetation.",
    "Motion": "An African elephant stands in the tall grass with its head lowered, foraging for food. It makes subtle movements with its head and trunk as it chews, and its large right ear moves gently.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an outdoor, arid savanna under soft, warm light. The landscape is characterized by a mix of dry, pale-yellow grass and dense, thorny green bushes that dominate the foreground and mid-ground. In the background, scattered, thin-trunked trees with sparse foliage are visible. A large, dark-skinned elephant with a visible tusk stands partially obscured by the vegetation.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a large elephant is positioned in the left-middle ground, partially obscured by thorny green bushes and dry grass that occupy the foreground and bottom of the frame. In the background, more savanna vegetation and scattered trees are visible. The camera is positioned at the elephant's level, and the framing is slightly unsteady throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
