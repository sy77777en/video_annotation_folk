  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of an older man with short gray hair and glasses, wearing a maroon shirt with a yellow accent on the pocket, capturing him from the waist up. He is centrally positioned in the frame, seated at a table in the middle ground of a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, intimate atmosphere. His right hand holds chopsticks, directed towards a plate of noodles topped with vegetables located in the bottom center of the frame. A glass of iced tea sits to the right of the plate, also in the foreground. To the left side of the frame, partially visible, is another individual wearing a yellow garment with a subtle pattern. The background includes additional tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs, arranged symmetrically along the walls, enhancing the restaurant’s classic, cozy charm. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the man sharp while blurring the background. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the rich colors of the food and surroundings. The man begins speaking, holding chopsticks in his right hand, hovering over the plate of noodles, his head slightly tilted downward while still looking ahead. The camera remains completely static, ensuring the older man remains the focal point throughout the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame, maintaining a focus on the dining experience within this inviting environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
