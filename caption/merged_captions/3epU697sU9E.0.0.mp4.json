  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle satellite perspective, the video begins with an extreme wide shot focused on a coastal area. In the top-left, a turquoise marker for \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" is visible, with the resort itself located in the center-left. An illuminated orange line, representing a route, originates from this point and extends towards the bottom right, with a glowing blue rectangle positioned near the start of the path. The camera rapidly zooms out, rolls clockwise, and pans right to reveal a larger map area, transitioning from an extreme wide shot of \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" to a wider view that includes \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" and a highlighted route between them. As the camera slowly zooms out and pans slightly right, the view expands to reveal a larger geographical area. A second turquoise marker for \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" appears in the top-right, situated on the mainland. The video showcases a digitally rendered nightscape of a coastal city and its surrounding turquoise waters, resembling satellite imagery. The full orange route becomes visible, connecting the resort on the left island to the school on the right mainland. An orange illuminated route overlays the terrain, winding across bridges and through the city to connect these two points. A blue illuminated rectangle moves along the route, enhancing the visual representation of the path as the perspective slowly zooms out to reveal the full extent of the connection. The final framing shows the island on the left and the mainland on the right, all set against a dark blue-green water background, establishing the complete spatial relationship between the two marked locations. The entire map is kept in sharp focus with a deep depth of field.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, satellite-like perspective, the camera rapidly zooms out, rolls clockwise, and pans right to reveal a larger map area. This quick and smooth movement transitions from an extreme wide shot of \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" to a wider view that includes \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" and a highlighted route between them. The entire map is kept in sharp focus with a deep depth of field.",
    "Subject": "The video simulates a satellite camera view of a coastal city, starting with an extreme wide shot that gradually reveals a broader landscape. Two key locations are marked: The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort and Emma E. Booker Elementary School. An orange line highlights a route connecting these two places, traversing the cityscape. A blue dot moves along the orange line, representing someone traveling along the highlighted route. The scene focuses on the geographical layout, with the path prominently displayed, emphasizing the connection between the marked locations.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an extreme wide-angle satellite shot of a coastal city, showcasing Colonial Beach and a tennis resort. A glowing blue rectangle moves along an orange route, gradually revealing a wider landscape. As the camera zooms out, Emma E. Booker Elementary School is marked on the map. The video concludes as the blue rectangle approaches the first corner of the route, highlighting the initial part of the journey.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases a digitally rendered nightscape of a coastal city and its surrounding turquoise waters, resembling satellite imagery. It begins with a focus on a section of an island, gradually expanding to reveal a panoramic view of the coastal island and its dense urban grid. Two prominent turquoise location markers are visible: \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" on the left, positioned on a narrow strip of land near the ocean, and \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" on the right, nestled within the urban grid. An orange illuminated route overlays the terrain, winding across bridges and through the city to connect these two points. A blue illuminated rectangle moves along the route, enhancing the visual representation of the path as the perspective slowly zooms out to reveal the full extent of the connection.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
