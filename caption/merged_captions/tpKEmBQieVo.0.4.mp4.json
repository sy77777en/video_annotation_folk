  "merged_caption": "The video offers a first-person perspective of a person climbing a rocky surface, with their hands and bright yellow jacket with black and blue accents consistently visible in the lower center of the frame. The hands frequently move across the rocks, likely to maintain balance, as they grip the edge of a large, uneven rock in the foreground. The vibrant jacket contrasts with the gray rocky terrain, which extends across the frame, scattered with numerous gray rock fragments in the middle ground. In the background, the view opens up to green valleys and distant cliffs, highlighting the height and scale of the environment. The camera, positioned at the climber's height, captures the rugged texture of the rocks and the expansive landscape below. The video begins with a shaky first-person perspective from a head-mounted camera, capturing the experience of rock climbing. It starts with a counterclockwise roll and features dynamic tilts up and down to showcase the surroundings. The person moves their feet in coordination with his hands, maintaining a firm grip on the edge of the large, uneven rock. His hands are in constant motion along the rock surface, suggesting he is balancing on the rocky terrain. As the video progresses, the rocky terrain and distant scenery shift slightly, indicating the climber's careful navigation of the uneven terrain. The time of day is likely midday, as the scene is brightly lit with clear visibility. The climber's hands are visible, gripping the rough, textured gray rocks, while a predominantly bright yellow jacket with blue and black striped accents adds a vibrant contrast to the natural backdrop. The expansive view includes distant cliffs and valleys, emphasizing the height and scale of the environment. The video concludes with a series of alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, enhancing the immersive experience.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a shaky first-person perspective from a head-mounted camera, capturing the experience of rock climbing. It starts with a counterclockwise roll and features dynamic tilts up and down to showcase the surroundings. The camera angle shifts between bird’s eye view and upside-down high angles, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The video concludes with a series of alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, enhancing the immersive experience.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing a bright yellow jacket with black and blue accents, standing on a rocky surface. The individual is seen from a first-person perspective, with their hands gripping the edge of a large, uneven rock. The rocky terrain is composed of numerous gray rock fragments, and near the cliff's edge, a view opens up to the green valleys below. The person's hands are positioned firmly on the rock, suggesting a climbing or balancing activity. The view emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks and the vibrant color of the jacket, highlighting the contrast between the person and the natural environment.",
    "Motion": "The person moves their feet in coordination with his hands, maintaining a firm grip on the edge of the large, uneven rock. His hands are in constant motion along the rock surface, suggesting he is balancing on the rocky terrain.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing the experience of a person climbing a rugged mountain. The setting is outdoors, high above a rocky landscape, with jagged stone surfaces and loose gravel underfoot. The time of day is likely midday, as the scene is brightly lit with clear visibility. The climber's hands are visible, gripping the rough, textured gray rocks, while a predominantly bright yellow jacket with blue and black striped accents adds a vibrant contrast to the natural backdrop. The expansive view includes distant cliffs and valleys, emphasizing the height and scale of the environment. The scene conveys a sense of motion as the climber carefully navigates the uneven terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
