  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on a young gymnast in a black leotard with a cutout on the back, who is actively jumping and preparing to run towards the background. A line of young female gymnasts with diverse skin tones stands in the left foreground and middle ground, remaining stationary throughout the scene. The first girl in the line has a ponytail and long, dark brown hair, wearing a red leotard. Next to her, a girl with light brown hair in a ponytail wears a purple and pink leotard with black lettering along its entire length. The third girl in line has dark brown hair and is dressed in a green leotard with a gold waistband. The other girls in the line are visible behind them, all wearing different colored leotards and standing with their arms by their sides or crossed. As the gymnast in black runs away from the camera along a path made of mats in a gymnasium, she becomes smaller in the frame, transitioning the scene into a wide shot. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, begins with focusing on the line of gymnasts in the foreground. As the gymnast runs over a row of sky blue mats towards the opposite end, where there is a pile of blue mats and various gymnastics equipment, the camera pans slightly left and performs a rack focus, ensuring that the running gymnast remains in clear focus as she moves towards the background. The scene takes place inside a long gymnastics training facility with two-toned grey walls and a floor that has a greenish hue, covered with both blue and sky blue mats. A metal bar is on the floor near the door on the right, and pipes are attached to the ceiling and the right wall. The room is illuminated by light bars installed on the ceiling, and a blue sign protrudes from the right wall. Additional exercise equipment is located on the left side of the room.",

    "Camera": "This is a slow, smooth, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field. The camera begins with focusing on a line of gymnasts in the foreground. As another gymnast runs away to the background, the camera pans slightly left and performs a rack focus, ensuring that the running gymnast remains in clear focus as they move towards the background.",
    "Subject": "A young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied in a messy bun runs away from the camera toward a pile of blue mats in the background. She is wearing a black leotard with a cutout on the back. In the foreground, a line of several other young female gymnasts with diverse skin tones stands watching her. The first girl in the line has a ponytail and long, dark brown hair, wearing a red leotard. Next to her, a girl with light brown hair in a ponytail wears a purple and pink leotard with black lettering along its entire length. The third girl in line has dark brown hair and is dressed in a green leotard with a gold waistband. The other girls in the line are visible behind them, all wearing different colored leotards and standing with their arms by their sides or crossed. Additionally, there is another gymnast, whose hands are barely visible, located on the lower left side.",
    "Motion": "A young gymnast in a black leotard runs away from the camera along a path made of mats in a gymnasium. In the foreground, a line of other young gymnasts stands stationary, turning their heads or bodies to follow her with their eyes as she recedes into the background.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a long gymnastics training facility with two-toned grey walls and a floor that has a greenish hue, covered with both blue and sky blue mats. On the left, a line of young gymnasts in assorted colorful leotards stands still on blue mats. On the right side of the room, a gymnast in a black leotard runs over a row of sky blue mats towards the opposite end, where there is a pile of blue mats and various gymnastics equipment. A metal bar is on the floor near the door on the right, and pipes are attached to the ceiling and the right wall. The room is illuminated by light bars installed on the ceiling, and a blue sign protrudes from the right wall. Additional exercise equipment is located on the left side of the room.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
