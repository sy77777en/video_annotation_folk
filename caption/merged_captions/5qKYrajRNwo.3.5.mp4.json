  "merged_caption": "In a static wide shot, a stop-motion figure of a young girl with brown skin and long, dark braided hair sits cross-legged on the floor in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground of a dimly lit, cluttered interior room. She wears a simple, light-colored sleeveless dress and has large, round, button-like eyes. In front of her are a dark satchel and scattered papers. To the bottom left, a stack of woven baskets is situated in the middle ground, establishing depth. Further back and to the right of the center, another figure of an older woman, wearing an orange garment and with a long face and round eyes, is seated in the out-of-focus background. A green bucket is visible in the middle ground on the right, while a faintly glowing lantern is situated in the background on the left. The camera remains stationary at the seated girl's level, focusing on her in the midground, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The young girl gazes at an open book on her lap and occasionally blinks her eyes. Her hand, holding a thin stick, moves slightly around the ground in front of her. In the background, the out-of-focus figure of the older woman moves her hands and arms as she works on a task. The middle ground is illuminated by a warm, soft light from an invisible source, while the rest of the space remains in deep shadow, likely at night. The room is filled with various household items, including small woven baskets, scattered papers, and a dark satchel.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a static, eye-level camera at a level angle. The focus is set on the young girl puppet in the midground, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, a stop-motion figure of a young girl with brown skin sits cross-legged on the floor in the middleground. She has long, dark hair styled in two braids and wears a simple, light-colored sleeveless dress. Her most distinct feature is her face, which has large, round, button-like eyes. She holds an open book in her lap and a thin stick in her hand. In the background and out of focus, another stop-motion figure of an older woman is seated. This figure wears an orange garment, and her facial features are similarly stylized with a long face and round eyes.",
    "Motion": "The stop-motion figure of a young girl in the middleground gazes at an open book on her lap and occasionally blinks her eyes. Her hand, holding a thin stick, moves slightly around the ground in front of her, while in the background, the out-of-focus figure of an older woman moves her hands and arms as she works on a task.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dimly lit, cluttered interior room with a rough, uneven floor, likely at night. The middle ground is illuminated by a warm, soft light from an invisible source, while the rest of the space remains in deep shadow, and a small lantern provides a faint glow in the background. The room is filled with various household items, including small woven baskets, scattered papers, a dark satchel, and a green bucket. In the middle ground, a stop-motion puppet of a young girl with dark, braided hair sits on the floor, looking at an open book. Another puppet figure is seated in the softly lit, out-of-focus background.",
    "Spatial": "In a static wide shot, a stop-motion figure of a young girl is positioned in the center-left of the frame, seated on the floor in the middle ground. In front of her, also in the middle ground, are a dark satchel and scattered papers. To the bottom left, a stack of woven baskets is situated in the middle ground, establishing depth. Further back and to the right of the center, another figure of an older woman is seated in the out-of-focus background. A green bucket is visible in the middle ground on the right, while a faintly glowing lantern is situated in the background on the left. The camera remains stationary at the seated girl's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
