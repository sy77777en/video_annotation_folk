  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a large, dark tree trunk with textured bark occupies the right foreground, partially obscuring the view. A cheetah with a tan coat covered in black spots and a long, ringed tail with a white tip is positioned in the middle ground, initially emerging from behind the right side of the tree. The scene is set in a grassy, wooded area during the daytime, with vibrant green grass interspersed with patches of bare, brown earth. The background is filled with a mix of smaller trees and green foliage, creating a dense, natural setting. The camera, positioned at the cheetah's level, uses a deep focus and smoothly pans left to track the cheetah as it walks from right to left across the center of the frame. The cheetah moves through a clearing of dirt and grass, stepping onto a patch of dirt and lowering its head to sniff the ground. The camera stops with slight shaking as the cheetah continues its movement across the scene.",

    "Camera": "From a high, eye-level perspective, the camera uses a deep focus. It smoothly pans left to track a cheetah as it walks, then stops with slight shaking.",
    "Subject": "A cheetah with a tan coat covered in black spots and a long, ringed tail with a white tip walks from right to left. It is partially obscured by the dark, textured trunk of a large tree in the foreground. The cheetah lowers its head to the ground as it moves across a patch of dirt in a grassy, wooded area.",
    "Motion": "A cheetah walks out from behind a large tree, moving from right to left across a grassy area. It steps onto a patch of dirt and lowers its head to sniff the ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a grassy, wooded area during the daytime. A large, dark tree trunk with textured bark stands prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The ground is covered in vibrant green grass, interspersed with patches of bare, brown earth. In the background, a mix of smaller trees and green foliage creates a dense, natural setting. A cheetah with a spotted coat walks through a clearing in the mid-ground, moving from right to left behind the main tree.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a large tree trunk occupies the right foreground. A cheetah is positioned in the middle ground, initially emerging from behind the right side of the tree. It walks from right to left across the center of the frame, moving through a clearing of dirt and grass before lowering its head to the ground. The background is filled with green trees and foliage. The camera is positioned at the cheetah's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
