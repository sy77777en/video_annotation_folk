  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a kayaker, who is consistently positioned in the center foreground. Initially, the camera is above the subject, capturing them moving forward through turbulent whitewater that stretches from the foreground to the background, with dark rock walls on the left and right sides of the frame. The kayaker, wearing a red and black wetsuit, a grey helmet with orange markings, and a life vest, paddles vigorously, gripping a paddle to navigate the rushing water. The camera is positioned at eye level, tracking the movement of the kayaker, initially at a high angle looking down, which then transitions to a level angle due to camera motion. A Dutch angle is present and varies as the camera rolls. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. There is a clear forward movement, though the camera is unsteady with noticeable shaking. By the end of the video, the camera perspective shifts to the kayaker's eye level. From this viewpoint, the kayaker remains in the center foreground, actively paddling, as the flanking rock walls appear to move towards the foreground on either side. Briefly, a second kayaker in a red kayak is visible in the top center to top right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground to background. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the kayaker and the rushing water, with water splashing around them. The individual is oriented forward, focused on navigating the challenging conditions. The helmet and wetsuit provide protection, indicating the intensity of the activity. The dark, textured rock walls of the canyon rise steeply on either side of the rushing water, enhancing the dramatic setting.",

    "Subject": "The video features a person kayaking through turbulent waters. The individual is wearing a red and black wetsuit and a helmet with visible logos. They are gripping a paddle, maneuvering through the white water, which splashes around them. The person is oriented forward, focused on navigating the challenging conditions. The helmet and wetsuit provide protection, indicating the intensity of the activity. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the kayaker and the rushing water.",
    "Motion": "A kayaker paddles through turbulent whitewater, moving forward as water splashes around them. The kayaker uses the paddle to navigate the rushing water.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a kayaker navigating through a narrow, dark rock canyon filled with turbulent whitewater. The kayaker, wearing a red jacket, a grey helmet with orange markings, and a life vest, paddles vigorously. The dark, textured rock walls of the canyon rise steeply on either side of the rushing water. Another kayaker in a red kayak is briefly visible further down the waterway. The scene is dynamic, with water splashing and the kayaker actively maneuvering through the rapids.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
