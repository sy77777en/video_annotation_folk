  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a pixelated, humanoid character positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a small platform. The character is depicted wearing attire resembling warrior armor, featuring a long, bright red coat with yellow trim and cuffs. The scene is set at night high atop a dark, metallic tower-like structure. In the background, a large full moon is partially visible behind the structure's scaffolding, set against a swirling, greenish-blue nebula in a starry sky above dark purple clouds. Large chains hang down the center of the tower. The smooth camera pedestals upward, following the character as they ascend on the platform, which rises like an elevator. Once the platform stops, the character moves to the right, navigating the environment. As the character continues moving, an icon in the HUD emits a burst of light, indicating an ability coming off cooldown. The character moves from the small, suspended platform to a wider bridge where a glowing blue potion rests. Throughout the video, UI elements remain fixed at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen, including a health bar, ability icons, a minimap, and various in-game counters for currency and time. The camera maintains a position level with the character as they move to the right.",

    "Subject": "A pixelated, humanoid character is depicted wearing attire resembling warrior armor, featuring a long, bright red coat with yellow trim and cuffs.",
    "Motion": "The humanoid character first stands on a platform, which rises like an elevator. Once the platform stops, the character moves to the right.

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video captures a scene set at night high atop a dark, metallic tower-like structure. In the background, a large full moon is partially visible behind the structure's scaffolding, set against a swirling, greenish-blue nebula in a starry sky above dark purple clouds. The scene, rendered in a pixel art style, features large chains hanging down the center of the tower. A character moves from a small, suspended platform to a wider bridge where a glowing blue potion rests. Overlays are present, including a health bar and ability icons at the bottom left, and a minimap at the bottom right, along with various in-game counters for currency and time.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a pixelated character positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a small platform. The character is framed by a dark tower structure, with a large moon and a green nebula visible in the background. As the riser stops, the character moves to the right. Throughout the video, UI elements remain fixed at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen, and the camera maintains a position level with the character."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
