  "merged_caption": "This scene features two subjects in a bedroom with soft, warm lighting. Initially, a woman with long, dark brown hair and a light to medium skin tone is framed in a medium close-up on the right side of the frame in the foreground, slightly out of focus. She is wearing a white, short-sleeved collared shirt and is seen brushing her hair with both hands. In the middle ground, a shirtless man with longish dark hair, a light skin tone, and a lean build is captured in a medium shot on the left, sitting up in a bed that extends across the lower half of the frame. The man, who has visible chest hair, a tattoo on his left pectoral muscle, and another on his left arm, is leaning against pillows, with a light-colored blanket covering him from the waist down. He is positioned in front of several pillows and a dark, upholstered headboard, with a plain, light-colored wall visible in the background. The man is looking at and speaking to the woman, who is listening to him. As the man leans slightly forward, extending his hands while speaking, the camera, from a smooth, eye-level perspective, slowly pans left and zooms in to highlight the man in the middle ground. The shot maintains a shallow focus, keeping the man relatively clear while the woman in the foreground appears somewhat out of focus. The man is wearing a ring on his right hand, and the woman is wearing a ring on her left hand. The bed is adorned with light-colored sheets and a grey blanket, and several pillows are propped against the headboard, including some with a textured cream fabric and a solid grey one.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
