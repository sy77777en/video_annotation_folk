  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man with dark, short hair, wearing a dark suit jacket over a collared shirt and dark trousers, is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. He walks from right to left along an outdoor walkway at night, moving parallel to a dark metal railing that occupies the foreground, running horizontally across the lower half of the screen. The city is illuminated by an array of vibrant neon signs in teal, blue, and pink that adorn the storefronts, many featuring Korean script. Through the large glass windows of the shops, white refrigerated cases are visible. The entire environment is bathed in a cool, greenish-blue light cast by the glowing signs. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, tracks the man’s movement from the side, keeping him consistently in the right half of the frame. It moves backward and to the left, maintaining a front-side angle on the man. The shot utilizes a deep focus, ensuring both the man and the neon-lit storefronts in the background remain relatively clear.",

    "Scene": "At night, a man in a dark suit walks outside from a store, situated in the middle ground of the scene. In the foreground, a dark metal railing is visible.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
