  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a modern balcony overlooking a cityscape. The foreground is occupied by the balcony floor in the bottom half of the frame, with two modern-style chairs with gold-colored bases and dark, textured seats, and a small, matching gold table positioned in the center-right. The background, seen through large glass panels on the left, consists of a stylized cityscape under a partly cloudy sky. A dark, curved ceiling frames the top of the shot, and a text overlay is visible in the top right corner, stating \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final building may differ.\" The camera, positioned at the height of the furniture, smoothly moves forward and upward, showcasing the view from a modern apartment balcony. As the camera moves, the cityscape view shifts, with the furniture transitioning from the midground to the foreground and the bottom of the frame. The scene is a static, computer-animated scenery shot of a luxurious high-rise apartment balcony, overlooking a sprawling cityscape with prominent skyscrapers during what appears to be sunset. The balcony features a smooth, light-colored floor and is partially covered by a dark, curved ceiling, with large glass panels offering an expansive view. Outside, a collection of simple, light-colored skyscrapers rises from the landscape below, casting long shadows in the warm, late-afternoon light. The sky transitions from blue to pink near the horizon, with a few clouds visible. The emphasis is on the vastness and architectural beauty of the cityscape, rather than any specific object, highlighting the environment and scale of the urban landscape. A deep focus is used, keeping both the foreground furniture and the distant cityscape in sharp detail.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
