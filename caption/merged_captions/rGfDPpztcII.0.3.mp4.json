  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man, who is consistently centered in the foreground, skiing down a snowy slope that occupies the background, stretching from the bottom to the top of the frame. He is seen from a very close, first-person perspective, likely from a camera mounted on his helmet. The man is wearing a light-colored, possibly white and grey camouflage-patterned ski jacket, and a light blue or teal ski helmet with an orange logo and the text \"pecsports.com\" on the side, along with a white sticker that says \"Be a HERO.\" His eyes are covered by large, orange-lensed ski goggles with a black frame and a light blue or teal accent on the nose bridge. He has a prominent, light brown or reddish beard and mustache, which become increasingly covered in white snow as the video progresses. His mouth is visible and open, and by the end, his beard and the area around his mouth are heavily coated in snow. Evergreen trees are visible in the middle ground to background on both the left and right sides of the slope, under an overcast sky at the top of the frame. One of his ski poles is occasionally visible in the left foreground. As he descends, fresh powder snow sprays upwards from the bottom of the frame, sometimes partially obscuring the lower portion of the man and the immediate foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a low angle, and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves backward and downward, leading the subject (a skier) from the front with smooth, minimally shaky movement. The environment is blanketed in white snow, with scattered evergreen trees lining the sides of the run under an overcast sky. As the descent progresses, fresh powder snow sprays upwards, occasionally obscuring the person being filmed.",

The camera moves backward and downward, leading the subject (a skier) from the front with smooth, minimally shaky movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man, seen from a very close, first-person perspective, likely from a camera mounted on his helmet.

    "Motion": "The man skis downhill, with snow spraying up from his skis and accumulating on his beard and around his open mouth. He holds ski poles, one visible on his right and a glimpse of the other on his left, as he descends the snowy slope.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, captures the descent down a snowy mountain slope. The environment is blanketed in white snow, with scattered evergreen trees lining the sides of the run under an overcast sky. As the descent progresses, fresh powder snow sprays upwards, occasionally obscuring the person being filmed.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
