  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a small, pixelated, anthropomorphic bird-like character with big black-and-white eyes, wearing a red top and a brown, wide-brimmed hat, in the lower center of the screen, positioned in the middle ground on a sandy island. The island features a yellow sandy beach with an orange-brown dirt path and a green, forested area with triangular trees in the background at the top. The island, surrounded by blue water with stylized white wave patterns that become a lighter, translucent turquoise near the shore, occupies the center of the frame, with the ocean in the background and on both sides. A row of six golden feather icons is overlaid in the bottom-left corner, and a compass is in the top-right. The character runs down the path toward the bottom of the frame, then runs to the western edge of the shore, turns slightly right, and jumps off the land, beginning to fly north over the water. The camera smoothly tracks the avatar, rolling counterclockwise and trucking left as the character moves through the environment. The character moves toward a red, arrow-shaped sign on the left edge of the island. The camera trucks left to follow as the character flies off the island, moving toward the left while maintaining its position in the center-left of the frame, with the island now occupying the right side and the water occupying the center and left side. Overlay elements are visible on the screen, including the row of six golden feather icons and the compass icon.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, aerial level perspective, the camera smoothly tracks the avatar, rolling counterclockwise and trucking left as the character moves through the environment.",
    "Subject": "A small, pixelated, anthropomorphic bird-like character runs on a sandy shore and later starts to fly. This character has big black-and-white eyes, wears a red top and a brown, wide-brimmed hat. Nearby on the shore stands a red, arrow-shaped sign. In the lower-left corner, a row of six golden feather icons is displayed as an overlay.",
    "Motion": "A pixelated, anthropomorphic bird-like character runs along a sandy path on an island. The character then runs to the western edge of the shore, turns slightly right, jumps off the land, and begins to fly north over the water.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a pixelated character runs along the coast of a sunny island. The island features a yellow sandy beach with an orange-brown dirt path. At a higher elevation, there is a green, forested area with triangular trees. The island is surrounded by blue water with stylized white wave patterns, which becomes a lighter, translucent turquoise near the shore. The character runs along the path and then ascends into the sky above the water near a red arrow sign on the sand. Overlay elements are visible on the screen, including a row of six golden feather icons in the bottom-left corner and a compass icon in the top-right.",

The character runs down the path toward the bottom of the frame before turning and moving toward a red sign on the left edge of the island.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
