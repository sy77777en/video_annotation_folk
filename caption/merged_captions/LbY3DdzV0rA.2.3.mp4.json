  "merged_caption": "This is a time-lapse scenery shot captured in a static extreme wide shot, played forward at a greatly accelerated speed, showing a massive storm cloud forming over a vast, arid desert landscape. The frame is predominantly filled with the sky, which occupies most of the space, while a flat desert landscape with sparse, dry vegetation occupies a small portion at the bottom. Initially, a large, white, billowing cumulonimbus cloud is centered in the upper portion of the frame against a blue sky, with blue sky visible at the top. The camera is completely static, positioned at a low angle looking up at the sky, with the camera height appearing to be between eye level and overhead, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. As the time-lapse progresses, the cloud system expands, and its base darkens to a deep, turbulent grey, stretching across the horizon and obscuring the sky. The dark grey base of the cloud extends and expands from the distant background towards the camera, casting a shadow that moves across the desert floor. The scene captures the dramatic and rapid development of a storm in an arid environment, with the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system itself as the focus. The colossal cloud, initially bright white, rapidly expands and darkens, its ominous, gray base spreading to engulf the horizon. Below, the flat, tan-colored desert stretches into the distance, becoming progressively shadowed as the storm rolls in.",

    "Subject": "This is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the dramatic development of a massive storm over an arid desert. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system itself. A colossal, initially bright white cumulonimbus cloud against a blue sky rapidly expands and darkens, its ominous, gray base spreading to engulf the horizon. Below, a flat, tan-colored desert with sparse, dry vegetation stretches into the distance, becoming progressively shadowed as the storm rolls in.",
    "Motion": "This video is a time-lapse shot of a massive storm cloud forming and moving over a desert landscape. The cloud begins as a large white formation and gradually expands and darkens, eventually covering the entire sky. The scene captures the dramatic and rapid development of a storm in an arid environment.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video captures a massive storm system forming and moving across a vast, arid desert landscape. Initially, a large, white, billowing cloud formation is set against a blue sky. As the sequence progresses, the cloud system expands, and its base darkens to a deep, turbulent grey, stretching across the horizon and obscuring the sky. Below, the flat, sandy ground is covered with sparse, dry vegetation.",
    "Spatial": "This is a scenery shot captured in a static extreme wide shot. The frame is predominantly filled with the sky, which occupies most of the space, while a flat desert landscape occupies a small portion at the bottom. Initially, a large, white cloud is centered in the upper portion of the frame, with blue sky visible at the top. As the time-lapse progresses, the dark grey base of the cloud extends and expands from the distant background towards the camera, casting a shadow that moves across the desert floor. The camera remains stationary, positioned between overhead and eye level, though the exact height is challenging to determine due to the limited view of the ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
