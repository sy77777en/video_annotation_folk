  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames three light-skinned men from the hip up, positioned centrally in the foreground of an outdoor, animated scene by a calm, blue-green body of water. The man in the suit stands on the left, appearing older with white hair, dressed in a light gray suit with a red tie and a white shirt, with his hands in his pockets. In the center, another older man with a wrinkled face and thinning gray hair stands with his arms crossed, wearing a mustard-yellow polo shirt. The man with glasses is on the right, younger with brown hair, wearing a white short-sleeved polo shirt and gray pants, holding his hands clasped in front of him. All three men are facing each other as if in conversation. Behind them, a large, out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast is visible on the left, moored under a hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds that fills the top of the frame. The overall visual style is that of a hand-drawn illustration. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in and tilts up, focusing on the three men as they converse, while the static, animated image shows no movement in the scene.",

    "Motion": "This video shows a static, animated image of three men standing and talking by the water, with a large ship in the background. There is no movement in the scene.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor, animated scene is set by a calm, blue-green body of water. In the background, a large, out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast is moored under a hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds. The overall visual style is that of a hand-drawn illustration.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames three men from the hip up, positioned centrally in the foreground. The man in the suit stands on the left, the man in the yellow shirt is in the center, and the man with glasses is on the right. Behind them, a body of water occupies the background. A large, out-of-focus vessel is visible in the background on the left, under a sky that fills the top of the frame. The camera gradually zooms in and tilts upward with a smooth motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
