  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot that emphasizes the young woman's reflection in the large mirror positioned in the center-left and middle ground. She is seen from her back, occupying the right foreground of the frame. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field with the focus specifically on the girl's reflection in the mirror in the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. The setting is an indoor bathroom during the daytime, characterized by plain, light-colored walls. Natural light enters the room through a window with horizontal slats, located on the right side of the frame and also visible as a reflection in the mirror. The young woman, with long, brown hair tied in a high ponytail, wears a grey t-shirt and has light skin. She initially holds a small, cylindrical, turquoise-colored spray can low in her hands, then raises the can slightly upwards. Her reflection in the mirror reveals her examining the spray can, removing the cap, and then pressing the top to release a small spray. Two black bands are visible on her right wrist in the reflection.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus specifically on the girl's reflection in the mirror in the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a young woman with long, brown hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a grey t-shirt, standing with her back to the viewer. Her reflection in the mirror reveals her with light skin and brown hair pulled back from her face. She is looking down at a small, cylindrical, turquoise-colored spray can held in her hands, which she then raises. Two black bands are visible on her right wrist in the reflection.",
    "Motion": "On the right side of the frame, a young woman stands, her reflection visible in the mirror. She examines a small, turquoise spray can in her hands, removes the cap, and then presses the top to release a small spray.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The setting is an indoor bathroom during the daytime, characterized by plain, light-colored walls. A large, rectangular mirror dominates the view, reflecting the same woman whose shoulder we are looking over. She has brown hair, wears a grey t-shirt, and holds a small, cylindrical, teal-colored spray can. After removing the cap and shaking it, she releases a small spray. Natural light enters the room through a window with horizontal slats, located to the right of the mirror.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot that emphasizes the young woman's reflection in the large mirror positioned in the center-left and middle ground. She is seen from her back, occupying the right foreground of the frame. She initially holds a small spray can low in her hands, then raises the can slightly upwards. A window with horizontal slats is located on the right side of the frame and is also visible as a reflection in the mirror. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
