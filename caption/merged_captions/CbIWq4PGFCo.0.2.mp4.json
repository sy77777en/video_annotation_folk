  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a young man with fair skin and dark, wavy hair from behind and in profile, positioned in the center of the frame. He is wearing a dark-colored shirt and occupies the foreground, facing towards the right, with his gaze directed downwards and towards the front. A prominent green lens flare is visible over his head and shoulder in the center-left. In the background, a vast, out-of-focus plain stretches towards a distant, hazy mountain range under a purple-hued sky. The scene is set outdoors at dusk, with a strong backlight creating a bright outline around the man's hair. Throughout the shot, the camera, positioned at the subject's eye level, slowly and smoothly arcs counterclockwise, using an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the man in the foreground. The young man remains motionless throughout the video, maintaining a fixed posture as the camera subtly shifts the perspective on the subject against the soft-focus, expansive landscape.",

    "Subject": "This video shows a close-up, side-profile view from behind a young man with fair skin and dark, wavy hair. He is wearing a dark-colored shirt. His gaze is directed downwards and towards the front, with his profile visible against a hazy, out-of-focus background. A strong backlight creates a bright outline around his hair, and a prominent green lens flare is visible over his head and shoulder.",

    "Scene": "Outdoors at dusk, a vast, open plain stretches toward a distant, hazy mountain range under a purple-hued sky. A young man with dark hair is seen from behind and in profile, his head illuminated by a strong backlight that creates a prominent green lens flare. The camera slowly moves, subtly shifting the perspective on the subject against the soft-focus, expansive landscape.",
    "Spatial": "A medium close-up shot frames a young man from behind and in profile, positioned in the center of the frame. He occupies the foreground, facing towards the right, with a prominent green lens flare visible over his head and shoulder in the center-left. In the background, a vast, out-of-focus plain stretches towards a distant mountain range. Throughout the shot, the camera arcs counterclockwise, keeping the man's profile centered in the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
