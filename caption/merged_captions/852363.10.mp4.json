  "merged_caption": "This video presents a medium shot of people on a fast-moving ride, filmed from a camera positioned slightly higher than the subjects' level. In the immediate foreground, the top of a person's head with light brown, wavy hair occupies the bottom center of the frame. The main subjects are in the middle ground: a light-skinned woman with long, bright pink hair is located in the center-right, and a light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing sunglasses and a black t-shirt, is to her left, in the top right. They are seated within a blue and grey ride car that extends across the middle of the frame. The ride's rapid motion causes the passengers to be jostled in their seats, with the woman's hair whipped around her face by the wind and the ride's motion, and both subjects have their mouths open. The camera shakes with the movement of the ride car, suggesting it might be held by someone in the foreground, and moves erratically without a clear directional pattern. The shallow focus keeps the people in the midground sharp while the foreground is blurred. In the background, other riders are seated in similar cars, including one person in a red shirt, and parts of the ride are visible in the top left and center. The entire frame is in constant, shaky motion, moving with the ride, causing the background to blur and the subjects' hair to fly around their faces. The scene takes place during the daytime at an amusement park, with the ride's cars constructed with blue and grey components, featuring safety harnesses. In the seats behind the foreground, the woman with pink hair is visible next to the man wearing sunglasses, with other riders in the surrounding area.",

    "Camera": "This slightly high-angle shot is captured with a camera positioned just above head level, though the exact height is difficult to determine due to a lack of clear reference points. The camera moves erratically without a clear directional pattern, and the shallow focus keeps the people in the midground sharp while the foreground is blurred.",
    "Subject": "The video features a light-skinned woman with long, bright pink hair, seated on a moving ride. Her hair is flying around her face, and her mouth is open. To her left is a light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing sunglasses and a black t-shirt; his mouth is also open. In the foreground, the top of the head of a person with light brown, wavy hair is visible. In the background, other riders are seated in similar cars, including one person in a red shirt.",
    "Motion": "A group of people on an amusement park ride moves forward at a high speed, causing them to be jostled in their seats. The camera shakes with the movement of the ride car, suggesting it might be held by someone in the foreground. In the seat behind, a woman with pink hair has her hair whipped around her face by the wind and the ride's motion. The man next to her also moves with the ride. In the background, other ride cars travel along the same track.",
    "Scene": "During the daytime at an amusement park, passengers are captured on a high-speed ride. The ride's cars are constructed with blue and grey components, featuring safety harnesses. In the seats behind the foreground, a woman with long, bright pink hair is visible next to a man wearing sunglasses, with other riders in the surrounding area. The rapid motion of the ride is conveyed by the blurred background and the passengers' hair blowing in the wind.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
