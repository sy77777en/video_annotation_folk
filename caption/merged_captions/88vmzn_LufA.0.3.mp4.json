  "merged_caption": "This scenery video opens with a low-angle wide shot, capturing the corner of a multi-story, red-brown brick building that fills the frame from the bottom edge upwards against a clear, pale blue-green sky. The building is positioned in the foreground and middle ground, with its corner running diagonally from the bottom center towards the top right. The camera smoothly zooms in and pans left toward the corner of the building, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire structure sharp. The building features classic architectural details, including intricate brickwork, large rectangular windows set in vertical bays, and a row of arched windows along the top floor beneath a dark cornice. As the view slowly zooms in on the upper floors, the camera focuses on the building's left-facing facade, eventually revealing a potted plant inside one of the windows. The eaves extend from the bottom left and bottom right corners to the top center, bringing the architectural details into closer view while maintaining the low-angle perspective. The shot emphasizes the building's imposing scale and textural details, creating an atmospheric and observational perspective rather than following a specific character or action. A portion of the clear sky is visible in the background at the top of the frame, enhancing the scene's open and airy feel.",

    "Camera": "From a low angle, the camera smoothly zooms in and pans left toward the corner of a large brick building. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire building sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering a low-angle, upward-looking view of the corner of a large, multi-story brick building against a clear, pale blue sky. The structure features classic architectural details, including intricate brickwork, numerous windows arranged in a grid, and a row of arched windows along the top floor beneath a dark cornice. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow zoom-in is designed to emphasize the building's imposing scale and textural details. The focus remains on the architectural environment, creating an atmospheric and observational perspective rather than following a specific character or action.",
    "Motion": "This video is a scenery shot that slowly zooms in on the upper floors of a large, multi-story brick building. The building features classic architecture with numerous windows set against a clear, pale blue sky. The shot provides a detailed, low-angle view of the building's corner facade.",
    "Scene": "An upward-looking shot captures the corner of a multi-story, red-brown brick building against a clear, pale blue-green sky. The building features classic architecture with large, rectangular windows set in vertical bays and a row of arched windows along the top floor, just below a dark cornice. The view slowly zooms in on the upper floors, eventually revealing a potted plant inside one of the windows.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
