  "merged_caption": "A medium shot captures a man and a woman at a bar counter from the man's eye level. The main subject of this animated video is a thin man with pale skin, dark messy hair, and dark circles under his eyes, who is sitting at the bar counter on the right side of the scene. He wears a black jacket over a white t-shirt and has a small glass in front of him. A woman, seen from behind, is on the left side of the scene, with dark hair tied up in a ponytail. She is wearing a white tank top and dark pants with a red belt, and has a large, intricate tattoo covering her right arm and another tattoo on her lower back. A bar counter stretches across the scene, with a pile of crumpled items between them, a small glass in front of the man, and a pink purse to his left. The dimly lit interior of the bar is visible behind them, cast in a reddish glow. The back wall is green-painted on the bottom and red at the top, adorned with a framed picture, and a few empty tables are scattered around. Initially, the camera remains static as the woman gestures with her right hand toward the man and takes money from his hand. The man, who is initially looking down, lifts his head slightly to look at her, then focuses on the pink purse. After the woman exits the frame, the camera smoothly and gradually zooms in to center the man at the bar.",

    "Scene": "This animated scene is set indoors at a dimly lit bar, cast in a reddish glow. The back wall is green-painted on the bottom and red at the top, adorned with a framed picture. A few empty tables are scattered around. At the bottom of the frame, a dark bar counter displays a pile of crumpled cash, some litter, a small shot glass, and a pink wallet. A woman with tattoos on her arm and lower back stands with her back to the viewer, while a man in a black jacket sits opposite her at the counter.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
