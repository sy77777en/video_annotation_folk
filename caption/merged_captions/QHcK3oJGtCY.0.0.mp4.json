  "merged_caption": "The video is captured from a static, eye-level perspective, showing a desert scene with a vast landscape of undulating sand dunes under a partly cloudy sky. Five large black camels and one smaller white camel traverse the scene from the left to the right side of the frame, moving through the foreground. The camels walk one by one, with the larger black camels partially visible, showing only the rear half of their bodies as they enter from the left and then the front half as they exit to the right. In contrast, the smaller white camel is captured in a full shot, with its entire body visible as it walks across the frame. The immediate sandy terrain occupies the bottom of the frame, while a large sand dune is positioned in the upper left and center, with a cloudy sky filling the top portion of the frame. The camera employs deep focus, ensuring both the camels and the expansive desert background remain sharp and clear. The camels are distinguished by their size and color, with the larger ones being black and the smaller one white, creating a striking contrast against the sandy desert backdrop. The setting is outdoors, characterized by the warm, golden hues of the sand stretching into the distance, with gentle slopes and ridges. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the desert environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a static camera positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing a group of camels walking across a desert landscape one by one. The camera employs deep focus, ensuring both the camels and the expansive desert background remain sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk from left to right, passing the camera one by one. Each large camel is only partially visible as they move across the frame, with half of their bodies captured at a time—first showing their right side and then their left. In contrast, the smaller white camel is fully visible within the frame as it passes. The camels are distinguished by their size and color, with the larger ones being black and the smaller one white, creating a striking contrast against the sandy desert backdrop.",
    "Motion": "In a vast desert landscape with sand dunes and a partly cloudy sky, a group of five large black camels and one smaller white camel walk from left to right, passing the camera one by one. The camels are partially visible as they move, with the larger ones showing only half of their bodies at a time, while the smaller white camel is fully visible.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes under a sky filled with many clouds. The setting is outdoors, characterized by the warm, golden hues of the sand stretching into the distance. The terrain features gentle slopes and ridges. A line of camels is present, moving across the scene, contrasting with the sandy backdrop. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the desert environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video is captured from a static, eye-level perspective, showing a desert scene. Five large black camels and one smaller white camel traverse the scene from the left to the right side of the frame, moving through the foreground. The framing for the large black camels is a medium shot, showing only the rear half of their bodies as they enter from the left and then the front half as they exit to the right. In contrast, the smaller white camel is captured in a full shot, with its entire body visible as it walks across the frame. The immediate sandy terrain occupies the bottom of the frame. In the background, a large sand dune is positioned in the upper left and center, with a cloudy sky filling the top portion of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
