  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a stylized, orange humanoid figure with long, thin limbs and a dark-colored ponytail hairstyle squatting on a small, jagged pulley located in the center-right of the frame. The figure makes a significant leap forward, landing on a large pulley now positioned in the upper center of the frame, and slides down along the belt. It reaches another small pulley near the bottom center-right and makes another substantial jump forward, landing on a horizontal gear beneath a pinkish-purple platform in the center-left of the frame. The camera smoothly trucks left, maintaining a continuous side view as it tracks the character's rapid movements, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact location of the black pipe in the foreground, which becomes visible just before the figure jumps onto the horizontal gear. The figure transitions from the lower center-right of the frame to the left, landing on the gear below the platform. It then rolls forward, stands up, and jumps again, ultimately freezing in mid-air in the upper left of the frame as the video concludes. The scene unfolds in an undefined space filled with floating chunks of machinery, all rendered in a graphic, comic-book aesthetic. The machinery features numerous interconnected gears, belts, and pulleys in muted shades of teal, pink, and purple, outlined in thick black lines. The background resembles a textured, paper-like surface splattered with watercolor-like splotches of purple, teal, and grey, with faint gear patterns visible beneath the colors. While the machinery appears static, the orange figure actively navigates through the mechanical components, positioned on and among the components of a large, complex machine rendered in an unusual color palette of teal, pink, and dark purple, composed of numerous interconnected gears, pulleys, belts, and articulated arms in a fantastical and chaotic arrangement.",

    "Camera": "In this 2D animation, the camera's height and angle are not clearly defined. The camera smoothly trucks left, maintaining a continuous side view as it tracks the character jumping between various mechanical objects.",
    "Subject": "A stylized, orange humanoid figure with long, thin limbs and a dark-colored ponytail hairstyle is depicted in various contorted, crouching, leaping, and forward-rolling poses. This figure is positioned on and among the components of a large, complex machine. The machine itself is rendered in an unusual color palette of teal, pink, and dark purple, and is composed of numerous interconnected gears, pulleys, belts, and articulated arms in a fantastical and chaotic arrangement.",
    "Motion": "An orange humanoid figure squats on a small, jagged pulley before making a significant leap forward to land on a larger pulley, sliding down along the belt. It then lands on another small pulley and executes another substantial forward jump. The figure jumps onto a horizontal gear beneath a pinkish-purple platform, rolls forward, stands up, and jumps once more. As the video concludes, the figure is captured frozen in mid-air.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
