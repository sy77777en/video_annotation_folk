  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up shot that fills the frame with the central part of an animated man's face, with his eyes positioned in the upper center. His most prominent feature is his eyes, which are depicted with large cyan irises and magenta circles that expand outward from the center in a sequential pattern. The animated character holds a white plastic cup to his mouth with his left hand, as if about to drink. The camera smoothly pulls back and moves downward while tilting up slightly, transitioning to a close-up shot that reveals the man's head and shoulders, which remain centered. As the camera moves, he drinks from the cup and then slightly moves it away from his mouth. The background elements come into view on the wall behind him, set in a room with a vibrant, warm color palette dominated by reds and oranges. A green and white dartboard is visible on the left side of the wall, while decorative yellow lines that spell out \"Beer\" in cursive appear on the right side of the wall. In the far left of the scene, a list is displayed on the wall. In the lower right corner, there are two decorative items. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level throughout the shot. The central figure has red skin, short blond hair, and eyes that are bright cyan with magenta outlines and concentric circles.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
