  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a white ceramic toilet viewed from a top-down perspective, centered within the frame against a dark, monochromatic gradient background. Initially, the toilet is shown with the seat down and the lid upright, occupying the center of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned directly above the toilet, providing a clear view of its rounded seat and rectangular tank. The toilet has a smooth, glossy surface and a standard design, with the seat and lid both matching in color and material. The orientation of the toilet remains consistent throughout the video, and no other objects or subjects are present. The scene is rendered in a simple, grayscale style, with the toilet centered within a spotlight. The camera uses shallow focus, concentrating on the toilet in the center while the surrounding background remains blurred. As the video progresses, the lid smoothly lowers to cover the seat, maintaining its central position within the frame. There is minor, very smooth upward camera movement, maintaining steadiness throughout. The spatial dynamics remain consistent, with the toilet staying in the foreground and the camera angle unchanged, emphasizing the lid's movement while the rest of the scene remains static.",

    "Camera": "The video is captured from an overhead, bird's-eye view at approximately second-floor height, looking directly down at a toilet. The camera uses shallow focus, concentrating on the toilet in the center while the surrounding background remains blurred. There is minor, very smooth upward camera movement, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a white ceramic toilet with a rounded seat and a rectangular tank, viewed from above. The toilet lid is initially upright, revealing the seat and bowl, and then the lid is lowered to cover the bowl. The toilet has a smooth, glossy surface and a standard design, with the seat and lid both matching in color and material. The orientation of the toilet remains consistent throughout the video, and no other objects or subjects are present.",
    "Motion": "The toilet lid starts in an upright position, exposing the bowl and inner rim, and then the lid is lowered until it covers the bowl completely. No other movement occurs in the video.",
    "Scene": "From a top-down perspective, a 3D-animated white toilet is centered within a spotlight against a dark, monochromatic gradient background. The toilet is initially shown with its seat down and lid in the upright position. In a smooth motion, the lid lowers onto the seat, closing completely. The entire scene is rendered in a simple, grayscale style.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
