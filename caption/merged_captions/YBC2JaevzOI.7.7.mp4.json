  "merged_caption": "A medium shot shows a young, fair-skinned man standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground, wearing a light green hoodie with the word \"VANS\" printed in dark letters across the chest and a light-colored baseball cap. He is framed by two tree trunks, one on the far left and one on the far right of the frame, in a dark forest at night. He holds a small, lit flashlight in his right hand, which illuminates his face and upper torso against a completely dark background, casting a bright light on him while the surrounding woods remain in deep shadow. His mouth is slightly agape as he looks forward, and the flashlight's beam is directed towards the viewer. The young man stands in the dark and rotates his entire body counterclockwise. The camera captures this from a level angle and eye level, using deep focus. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot but is slightly unsteady.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
