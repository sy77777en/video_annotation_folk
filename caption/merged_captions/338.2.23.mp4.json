  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a group of people seated around a dining table in a traditional Asian restaurant with ornate wooden paneling and warm lighting. Initially, the central figure, a man with short dark hair in a light-colored shirt, appears in the middle ground, slightly towards the left, and gradually moves to the center of the frame. On either side of him are two men: to the left, a man with short hair and glasses in a dark shirt, and to the right, a man in a yellow shirt and glasses holding chopsticks. In the lower left corner of the foreground, a woman with long dark hair in a green top is seen from behind; she eventually moves to the foreground, positioned at the left center. At the beginning of the video, a female server in a blue vest appears in the right center of the foreground, places a bowl of rice on the table with her left hand, then moves to the right, exiting the frame. In the background, three men in maroon shirts walk through the scene, carrying trays with food, positioned towards the top-center of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly moves downward and forward while simultaneously trucking left, focusing on the group of people seated at the table. The movement is steady with minimal shaking. The ornate wooden panels and warm lighting create depth, and the camera remains consistent in shot size and subject positions. The setting is characterized by a lively dining atmosphere, with patrons engaged in conversation and enjoying their meals, while the presence of servers moving between tables adds a dynamic element to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
