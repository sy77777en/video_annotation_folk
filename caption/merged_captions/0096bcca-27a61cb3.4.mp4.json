  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a city intersection at night, focusing on the overall scenery rather than a specific subject. The perspective is from a level angle, consistent with a vehicle's dashboard, looking straight ahead. In the foreground, the dark road and white lane markings occupy the bottom half of the frame. The middle ground contains the intersection itself, with red traffic lights visible at the top center and top left. A bright streetlight at the top center creates a large, circular lens flare against the black sky. A building occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, with a white SUV parked next to it on the far right. In the background, the road stretches into the center, where distant headlights are visible, and a brightly lit structure is positioned on the far left. Initially, the camera moves forward slowly and smoothly from an eye-level, straight-on perspective before coming to a stop. The scene is initially in deep focus, capturing the quiet, atmospheric mood of a city intersection after dark, with the glow of red traffic lights and a bright overhead streetlight illuminating the scene. The camera then loses focus towards the end of the video. The vehicle is stopped on a dark asphalt road, facing red traffic lights, and the dark street is illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of other distant cars. On the left side of the scene, a luminous sign adds a vibrant touch to the urban landscape. Faintly visible are the outlines of buildings to the right, enhancing the urban atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overall environment rather than on any specific person or object.",

    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a nighttime scene at an urban intersection. The vehicle is stopped on a dark asphalt road, facing red traffic lights. A bright, white streetlight overhead creates a prominent lens flare against the dark sky. To the right, a multi-story building lines the street, while on the far left, a structure is illuminated with colorful lights. Other vehicle headlights are visible in the distance down the straight road, and a white SUV is parked in the midground on the far right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
