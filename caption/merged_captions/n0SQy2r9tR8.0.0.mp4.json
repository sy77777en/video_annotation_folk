  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a dark-skinned man with short, dark hair, a goatee, and a mustache, who looks directly at the camera with a serious expression. He has distinct vertical slits shaved into both of his eyebrows and is wearing a light blue, patterned zip-up hoodie over a white t-shirt, with two silver-colored chain necklaces with pendants visible around his neck. The man is seated on a light-colored couch in a dimly lit room with a cool, bluish ambiance. The lighting is focused, illuminating the foreground while the background remains dark and out of focus, with only faint, out-of-focus shapes visible. The camera is positioned at eye level with a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. The camera executes a very smooth, minor movement, pulling back and tilting up slightly. As the scene progresses, the lighting on the man gradually dims, eventually leaving him almost entirely in shadow. Throughout this transition, he remains mostly stationary in the center of the frame, raising his head slightly as the lighting dims to near darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
