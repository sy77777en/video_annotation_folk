  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in a static full shot, framed at the subjects' level, in a dimly lit, spartan room at night. A person with pale skin lies still on their back in a hospital bed positioned in the center middle ground, covered to the chest by a white blanket, with their eyes closed and a watch visible on their left wrist. A young man with fair skin and short, light-colored hair sits in a chair to the right, also in the middle ground, wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and looking down at a file folder resting on his lap. The dark footboard of the bed occupies the foreground, creating a visual barrier. A white curtain is visible on the left, and a small gooseneck lamp stands on a table on the right, both in the middle ground, set against the plain, light-colored walls of the background. The room's primary illumination comes from a white light at the top of the frame, with additional light from the lamp casting a warm, focused glow. The overall visual style is monochromatic and desaturated. The young man shifts his attention from the person resting in the bed to the folder on his lap, moving his right hand across the folder to open it, while the person lying in the bed remains completely still. The camera executes a slow, smooth zoom-in from a level, eye-level perspective, using a deep focus to keep both the man sitting by the bed and the person lying in it in sharp focus. Wall-mounted equipment is visible in the background, enhancing the clinical atmosphere of the room.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a dimly lit, spartan room at night. A person lies still in a hospital bed with a metal frame, covered by a white blanket. To the right of the bed, a second person sits in a chair, holding a file folder on their lap. The room's primary illumination comes from a white light at the top of the frame, with additional light from a small gooseneck lamp on a bedside stand, which casts a warm, focused glow. The background consists of plain, light-colored walls, a white curtain on the left, and wall-mounted equipment. The overall visual style is monochromatic and desaturated.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
