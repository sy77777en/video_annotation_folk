  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a black Xbox One video game console is positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the bottom left to the top right. The console, with its rectangular shape, features a matte finish on its front panel and a glossy, vented top surface. The front face of the console occupies the middle ground, with its illuminated circular white Xbox logo located on the right. The top surface is visible across the top of the frame. The console is lit by a cool, greenish-toned light, creating a bright highlight along the top edge and casting the rest of the device in deep shadow. The camera, positioned above the subject, moves left with a slight, unintentional shake, maintaining an extremely shallow depth of field with the focus set on the Xbox console in the midground. The Xbox One console remains completely still throughout the shot, resting on a matte gray surface in a dimly lit indoor setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
