  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a monument at night. The central quadriga sculpture, featuring two gilded golden female figures leading four teal-colored bronze horses, is positioned in the center of the frame, existing in the middle ground. Below it, the monument's facade, constructed from light-colored stone and adorned with intricate bas-reliefs, carvings, and statues resembling soldiers, occupies the lower half of the frame, also in the middle ground. A large stone plaque with a French inscription is visible below the main sculpture. The dark night sky fills the top portion of the frame, serving as the background. The camera maintains a fixed, low-angle perspective, looking up at the illuminated structure. This time-lapse video is captured from a low angle, looking up at the statues on top of the monument. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire structure sharp. The camera performs a slow and very smooth zoom-in on the statues, dynamically emphasizing the majestic scale and dramatic lighting of the structure to create a powerful, atmospheric scene. The entire structure is illuminated from below, highlighting its intricate carvings against the dark night sky. The focal point is a magnificent quadriga sculpture, featuring a gleaming golden figure of a woman positioned near four rearing horses with a striking teal or verdigris patina. On the opposite side of the horses, another partially visible golden figure also guides them. Since the ground is not visible, the camera's height cannot be determined. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ PHOTOGRAPHER\".",

    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scene centered on a grand, classical monument illuminated against a dark night sky. The focal point is a magnificent quadriga sculpture, featuring a gleaming golden figure of a woman positioned near four rearing horses with a striking teal or verdigris patina. On the opposite side of the horses, another partially visible golden figure also guides them. Below this centerpiece, in front of the facade, are stone statues resembling soldiers. The facade itself is adorned with intricate bas-relief carvings and a large inscription. The camera dynamically zooms in and focuses on the architectural elements, emphasizing the majestic scale and dramatic lighting of the structure to create a powerful, atmospheric scene.",
    "Motion": "This video features a single shot of a monument at night. The camera slowly zooms in on the top of an ornate structure, which is crowned by a sculpture of two golden figures leading a quadriga of four greenish-blue horses. The entire structure is illuminated from below, highlighting its intricate carvings against the dark night sky.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, nighttime shot captures the illuminated top of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris against a dark sky. The central feature is a quadriga, a chariot pulled by four teal-colored bronze horses, driven by two gilded golden female figures. The monument itself is constructed from light-colored stone, adorned with intricate bas-reliefs, carvings, and lines of statues of soldiers below the central feature. A large stone plaque with a French inscription is visible below the main sculpture. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ PHOTOGRAPHER\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
