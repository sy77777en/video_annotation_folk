  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a spiny lobster in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with its white antennae stretching out into the foreground. This sandy area is encircled by a vibrant coral reef composed of red, pink, and purple formations that occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, the middle ground around the lobster, and the background in the upper portion of the scene. Numerous small orange fish are scattered throughout the middle ground to the background, swimming actively around the colorful coral reef. In the top left of the frame, a long, thin, snake-like creature with a black and white beaded pattern is draped over the coral in the middle ground. The camera is positioned above the lobster, providing a downward view of the scene. The high-angle, underwater shot is filmed with a deep focus, keeping the lobster and the surrounding coral reef sharp. The camera moves forward slightly with some minor unsteadiness and shaking. The spiny lobster remains mostly still on the sandy patch within the coral reef, but its two very long, thin, white antennae extend from its head, curving into the surrounding water and gently waving. The long, snake-like creature draped over the coral in the upper left also appears still but exhibits slight shaking throughout the video. The lobster's long, spindly legs are patterned with black and white bands, ending in yellow tips.",

    "Subject": "A spiny lobster, the main subject, rests on a patch of white sand within a crevice of a vibrant coral reef. Its long, spindly legs are patterned with black and white bands, ending in yellow tips. Two very long, thin, white antennae extend from its head, curving out into the surrounding water. Numerous small, bright orange fish swim around the lobster and the reef. In the upper left, a long, thin, snake-like creature with a black and white beaded pattern is draped over the coral.",

    "Scene": "An underwater scene reveals a vibrant coral reef composed of red, pink, and purple formations surrounding a patch of light-colored sand. A spiny lobster with a striped body and long, white antennae is positioned in the center on the sand. Small orange fish swim around the colorful coral, and a long, thin, patterned creature is partially visible in the upper left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
