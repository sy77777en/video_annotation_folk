  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of two men in a well-lit indoor setting, likely an office or laboratory. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing their upper bodies. The man in the gray suit with a red flower on his lapel is positioned in the midground, slightly left of center in the frame. He is speaking and slightly turns his head to his right, looking upwards towards his right front, maintaining a serious expression. The second man, dressed in a dark suit, is in the foreground on the right side of the frame, facing the man in the gray suit, indicating a direct interaction. He remains stationary without any noticeable movement. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the midground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The background consists of large cabinets and storage units, which remain static and unchanging. The environment appears to be a modern office or laboratory, characterized by clean lines and a minimalist design. The space is well-lit with fluorescent ceiling lights, although they flicker twice, suggesting a possible malfunction. The walls are a neutral color, and there are large cabinets or storage units with handles, indicating a functional workspace. The floor is smooth and light-colored, complementing the overall sleek aesthetic. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene remains consistent throughout, focusing on the interaction between individuals in this professional setting. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position of the subjects during the video; both men maintain their initial positions. The camera angle and height stay constant, emphasizing the dialogue between the two men.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the midground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features two men in a well-lit indoor setting. The man on the left, who is facing the camera, is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt and a beige tie, accented by a red flower on his lapel. He has short brown hair and a clean-shaven face, appearing to be in his 30s. His expression shifts from speaking to a more neutral look. The second man, partially visible on the right and facing away from the camera, is dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt. His hair is light brown and styled neatly. Both men are standing and facing each other, suggesting a conversation or interaction between them.",
    "Motion": "The man in the gray suit with a red flower on his lapel is speaking and slightly turns his head to his right, looking upwards towards his right front. He maintains a serious expression. On the right side of the screen, another person remains stationary without any noticeable movement. The background shows a well-lit indoor space with white shelves and various equipment, indicating an office or storage area.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot, capturing a character's upper body from behind in an indoor setting. The environment appears to be a modern office or laboratory, characterized by clean lines and a minimalist design.

The walls are a neutral color, and there are large cabinets or storage units with handles, indicating a functional workspace.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
