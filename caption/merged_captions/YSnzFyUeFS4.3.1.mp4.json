  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a first-person, eye-level perspective of a bustling New York City intersection during the golden hour of a clear day, with a cyclist on a white bicycle and a white police car in the center-left middle ground, and pedestrians crossing from the left. The camera, held at eye-level with mild barrel distortion, starts with a level view of the street before tilting up into a low angle. It initially pans slightly to the left, revealing more of the multi-story brick buildings and leafy green trees lining the sidewalks. The camera then performs a 180-degree pan to the right, shifting the view across the street to reveal food carts at the street corner in the middle ground and buildings positioned on both sides of the street in the midground and background. A Starbucks Coffee is visible on one corner. A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling, and the entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field. As the view completes the turn, a right arm enters from the right side and top right corner of the frame, followed by a tattooed left arm entering from the bottom left foreground, as they lift a black camera to the center. The person holding the camera then raises it into the frame, aiming it down the street toward the pedestrians and the distant skyline, with the One World Trade Center visible in the distant background. The final composition shows the arms and the held camera occupying the foreground, framing the street scene ahead. The person then takes a step back, concluding the movement.",

    "Camera": "This first-person video is filmed with mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera, held at eye-level, starts with a level view of the street before tilting up into a low angle. A varying Dutch angle is also present due to camera rolling. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field. The slightly unsteady camera initially pans left, then performs a 180-degree pan to the right as the person turns, continuing this motion for the remainder of the clip.",
    "Subject": "This video is shot from the first-person perspective of a light-skinned individual, whose tattooed left forearm and hands are visible at the end of the video when they raise their camera to take a photo down the street. In the bustling city street scene ahead, a light-skinned man in a blue t-shirt and shorts rides a white bicycle. Numerous pedestrians cross the street in a crosswalk. A white police car with emergency lights on its roof is stopped in the intersection, and three SUVs are waiting to move down the road, becoming visible after the camera pans right from the police vehicle.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera moves forward, initially panning left before making a 180-degree turn to pan right across a bustling city intersection. Pedestrians and cyclists cross the street in a crosswalk in front of the camera's path. The person holding the camera then raises it into the frame, aiming it down the street toward the pedestrians and the distant skyline.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a bustling New York City intersection during the golden hour of a clear day. The perspective initially pans slightly to the left, revealing more of the multi-story brick buildings and leafy green trees lining the sidewalks. Then, it executes a 180-degree turn to the right, facing the street behind. A Starbucks Coffee is visible on one corner, and pedestrians walk past food carts. A police car is stopped in the intersection, and a person on a bicycle rides through. As the view completes the turn, tattooed arms lift a camera, framing a shot of the street scene now behind, with the One World Trade Center visible in the distant skyline. The person then takes a step back, concluding the movement.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a first-person, eye-level perspective of a city intersection, with a cyclist and a police car in the center-left middle ground and pedestrians crossing from the left. The camera pans right in a wide arc, shifting the view across the street to reveal food carts at the street corner in the middle ground and buildings positioned on both sides of the street in the midground and background. A right arm enters from the right side and top right corner of the frame, followed by a tattooed left arm entering from the bottom left foreground, as they lift a black camera to the center. The final composition shows the arms and the held camera occupying the foreground, framing the street scene ahead, with the One World Trade Center visible in the distant background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
