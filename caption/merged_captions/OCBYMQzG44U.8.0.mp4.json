  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on the environment. From a first-person perspective with mild barrel distortion, the slightly unsteady camera starts above dark, murky water, maintaining a level angle throughout. The camera moves forward from the bottom of the frame, where green water and part of the left wall occupy the foreground, to approach and climb a set of tiled stairs partially submerged in water. As the camera ascends the stairs, transitioning from an above-water to an eye-level height, the water recedes from view, revealing the full length of a hazy, brightly lit corridor entrance in the center middle ground. Upon reaching the top, the perspective continues to move forward down the center of a long, narrow corridor. The walls, ceiling, floor, and stairs are all uniformly covered in a grid of small, square, white tiles, creating a sterile and disorienting grid that extends into the distance. The corridor is brightly illuminated by a series of glowing, oval-shaped lights or windows lining the left and right walls, stretching from the foreground into the background. These elements lead the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway located at the center of the far end of the tunnel in the background. The entire scene is kept in sharp, deep focus, conveying a strange, dreamlike atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "This video features a surreal architectural scenery shot, capturing a forward-moving perspective through a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all uniformly covered in small, white square tiles, creating a sterile and disorienting grid that extends into the distance. The sequence begins at the base of a short flight of tiled stairs partially submerged in dark, murky water, as the perspective moves forward and goes upstairs, the water recedes to reveal the full length of the brightly lit, hazy tunnel. Further down the corridor, a series of glowing, oval-shaped lights or windows line the walls, leading the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway at the very end. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on conveying the strange, dreamlike atmosphere of the environment itself.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot that moves forward through a long, sterile-looking hallway. The walls, floor, and ceiling are covered in small, off-white tiles with a greenish tint. The camera first moves through what appears to be murky water and up a set of stairs before entering a long corridor lined with glowing, oval-shaped elements that could be interpreted as either lights or windows, all leading to a dark doorway at the very end.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves rapidly through a surreal, indoor environment. The scene begins by emerging from dark, murky water at the bottom of a set of stairs. The camera ascends the stairs and then enters a long, narrow corridor. The walls, ceiling, floor, and stairs are all covered in a grid of small, square, white tiles. The corridor is brightly illuminated by a series of glowing, oval-shaped windows or lights lining the walls. At the far end of the brightly lit tunnel is a dark, rectangular doorway.",
    "Spatial": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on the environment. The camera maintains a level angle throughout, looking forward from the bottom of the frame where green water and part of the left wall occupy the foreground. A short flight of tiled stairs rises from the water in the center middle ground, leading up towards a hazy, brightly lit corridor entrance in the center middle ground. The camera then moves forward and upward, ascending the stairs as the water recedes from view. Upon reaching the top, the perspective continues to move forward down the center of a long, tiled corridor. This corridor is lined with glowing, oval-shaped lights or windows on the left and right walls, stretching from the foreground into the background and drawing the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway located at the center of the far end of the tunnel in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
