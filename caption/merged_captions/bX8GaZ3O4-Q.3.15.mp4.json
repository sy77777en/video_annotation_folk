  "merged_caption": "In a dark, outdoor setting at night, four green and brown frogs with bumpy skin are arranged across the lower half of the frame on a light-colored stone ledge, illuminated from below by a cool, greenish-blue light. The background is indistinct and dark, punctuated by out-of-focus, warm yellow lights in the upper portion of the frame. The camera captures a full shot at the subjects' level with a fixed, ground-level angle, though the frame is slightly unsteady, using a shallow depth of field to keep the frogs in focus. Three frogs occupy the foreground: one on the bottom left, a smaller one in the center-left, and another on the bottom right. A fourth, larger frog is positioned in the middle ground, center-right, slightly behind the others. The frog on the far left, which is large and has a greenish hue, repeatedly inflates and deflates its white vocal sac as it croaks. The other three frogs mimic this movement, adding subtle dynamics to the scene. The frog on the far right, a medium-sized one with a prominent white throat, sits facing slightly towards the left of the screen and also engages in the inflation and deflation of its vocal sac. The camera remains static throughout the shot, capturing the periodic inflation and deflation of the frogs' vocal sacs, which introduces a rhythmic motion to the otherwise still scene. The light from a nearby water source reflects off the wet surface, enhancing the visual texture of the setting.",

    "Subject": "Four green and brown frogs with bumpy skin are sitting in a row on a light-colored surface that appears wet due to the reflective light from a nearby water source. The frog on the far left of this screen, which is large and has a greenish hue, repeatedly inflates and deflates its white vocal sac as it croaks. To its left sits a smaller, stationary frog facing forward. Behind these two and slightly to the right is another large, still frog. On the far right of the screen, a medium-sized frog with a prominent white throat sits facing slightly towards the left of the screen.",
    "Motion": "The frog on the far right repeatedly inflates and deflates its white vocal sac. The other three frogs to its left mimic the same movement.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, outdoor setting at night, four green and brown frogs are positioned on a light-colored stone ledge. The scene is illuminated from below by a cool, greenish-blue light that casts a glow on the frogs and the surface they occupy. The background is indistinct and dark, punctuated by out-of-focus, warm yellow lights. The frogs' vocal sacs periodically inflate and deflate.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, four frogs are arranged across the lower half of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
