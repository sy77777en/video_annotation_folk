  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a person wearing a green hooded sweatshirt and a cap is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. They are crouched down in a dark, outdoor setting at night among leaves and twigs, holding a small, bright light source in one hand, which emits a warm, yellow glow. This light source is in the center-left, illuminating a dark-colored, low-top canvas sneaker with white laces and a white rubber sole and toe cap, held in the center-right, also in the middle ground. A small, bright green reflective point is visible on the side of the shoe, which the person is looking down at. The surrounding area remains in complete darkness. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, at a hip-level angle, and the composition remains static throughout the shot. However, the shot is slightly unsteady due to natural, subtle shakiness, and the extreme darkness of the scene makes the camera's focus and depth of field not discernible.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot from a level, hip-level angle. Due to the extreme darkness of the scene, the camera's focus and depth of field are not discernible.",
    "Subject": "In a dark environment, a person wearing a green hooded sweatshirt and a cap is crouched down. They hold a small, bright light source, which emits a warm, yellow glow, in one hand. With their other hand, they hold up a single, dark-colored, low-top canvas sneaker with white laces and a white rubber sole and toe cap. The person is looking down at the shoe, which is illuminated by the light, revealing a small, bright green reflective point on its side.",

They hold a bright light source in the center-left, which illuminates a sneaker held in the center-right, also in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
