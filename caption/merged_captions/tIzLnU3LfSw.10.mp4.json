  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot from an elevated angle, showing a group of hockey players in dark blue jerseys with red and white trim celebrating in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. The rink boards, marked with advertisements including a prominent green \"Jeep\" logo, occupy the foreground, while the ice is part of the middle ground, and spectators, including a man in a grey sweatshirt with the word \"PENGUINS\" on the front, are visible in the background behind the glass. The slightly unsteady camera zooms in, transitioning to a medium full shot that focuses more tightly on the players. The group, including players with numbers 27 and 9, embraces near the boards, patting each other on the back and raising their arms. A fourth teammate, wearing number 25, skates in from the right to join the celebration. An opposing player in a white and gold uniform, initially on the right, skates away from the group and out of the frame. A referee in a black-and-white striped uniform, initially on the left, skates into position nearby and moves to the right side of the huddle but exits the frame by the end. The celebrating players are centrally framed on the white ice surface, enclosed by white dasher boards and tall, clear protective glass. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the players in the middle ground and the crowd in the background clear. The indoor ice hockey arena provides the setting for this group celebration in a corner of the rink, with the spectators watching from their seats in the stands behind the glass.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
