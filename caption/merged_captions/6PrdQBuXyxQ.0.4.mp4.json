  "merged_caption": "In a wide, bird's-eye view shot from directly above, a woman with blonde hair tied back is positioned in the center of the frame, walking at a steady pace along a narrow, winding dirt path in a mountainous area. She is wearing a long-sleeved black top with lighter details on the arms and is carrying a black backpack. The path features a sharp right turn and its direction varies due to the camera's roll, initially extending from the bottom to the top, then shifting towards the bottom right, and finally returning to extend from bottom to top. The rugged terrain consists of a mix of green, grassy patches and exposed gray rock and gravel, with a large patch of motion-blurred green grass on both the left and right sides, while a rocky, gravelly area is more prominent on the left. The scene is brightly lit by daylight, casting a distinct shadow of the individual on the dirt path. The camera smoothly and aerially tracks the woman's movement, maintaining her central position as she progresses along the trail, rolling clockwise to follow her movement around a bend.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, overhead, bird's-eye shot with a deep focus. The camera aerially tracks a person walking along a mountain path, rolling clockwise to follow their movement around a bend.",
    "Subject": "An overhead, top-down view shows a woman with blonde hair tied back, walking along a rocky dirt path. She is wearing a long-sleeved black top with lighter details on the arms and is carrying a black backpack.",
    "Motion": "From an overhead view, a woman walks at a steady pace along a narrow, rocky dirt path that winds through a mountainous landscape.",
    "Scene": "From an overhead-level view, a person with blonde hair wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a backpack walks along a narrow, winding trail in a mountainous area. The rugged terrain consists of a mix of green, grassy patches and exposed gray rock and gravel. The scene is brightly lit by daylight, casting a distinct shadow of the individual on the dirt path. The grass on the left side of the view is blurred from motion.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide, bird's-eye view shot from directly above, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, walking along a winding dirt path that features a sharp right turn. The path's direction varies due to the camera's roll, initially extending from the bottom to the top, then shifting towards the bottom right, and finally returning to extend from bottom to top. The path divides the frame, with a large patch of motion-blurred green grass on both the left and right sides, while a rocky, gravelly area is more prominent on the left. The camera tracks the woman's movement, maintaining her central position as she progresses along the trail."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
