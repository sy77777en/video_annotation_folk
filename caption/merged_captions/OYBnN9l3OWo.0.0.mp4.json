  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a woman with light skin and blonde hair standing in the center foreground of a wide, open field of dry, brownish grass in Iceland. She is wearing a bright orange puffer jacket, black pants, white boots, and a light gray beanie. In the middle ground, a distinctive black wooden church with a steepled roof and white-trimmed windows is positioned in the upper center-right of the frame, with distant, hazy mountains visible in the background under an overcast sky. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead, using deep focus with a large depth of field to keep both the woman and the background elements sharp. The woman holds a black camera with a strap and then lifts it to her eye, looking through the viewfinder as if to take a picture. As she raises the camera to her face, the camera moves forward toward her, transitioning to a medium close-up while keeping her in the center of the frame. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking as it approaches her. An overlay of white text at the top of the scene reads, \"Tonight there's gonna be STRONG Northern Lights in Iceland.\"",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a wide, open field of dry, brownish grass in Iceland. In the background, a distinctive black wooden church with a steepled roof and white-trimmed windows stands against a backdrop of distant, hazy mountains under an overcast sky. A person in an orange puffer jacket and a grey beanie stands in the foreground, holding a camera. They raise the camera to their face as if taking a photograph. An overlay of white text at the top of the scene reads, \"Tonight there's gonna be STRONG Northern Lights in Iceland\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
