  "merged_caption": "This full shot opens with a woman with dark, styled hair, wearing a white lab coat over a red dress and dark heels, pushing a wheeled medical cart with equipment, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a large, sparsely populated hospital ward. Bright light streams in through a wide bank of windows covered with white horizontal blinds on the left, while a deep hallway is visible on the right. The room features light-colored linoleum flooring, white walls, and some sections of wood paneling, with several metal-framed hospital beds with white linens positioned throughout the space. The camera, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, smoothly moves backward while panning left to track the woman as she moves across the room. This movement reveals a young person with light brown hair, wearing a neck brace and dressed in white, lying propped up in a hospital bed with both legs in casts elevated on pillows. The patient's right hand is in a cast, supported by a bandage around the neck and resting on the chest, while holding a magazine or book on their lap. The patient comes to occupy the foreground from the left to the center of the frame. The woman and her cart arrive in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, stopping next to the patient's bed. Two dark-colored armchairs sit near the windows in the background. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level, capturing the woman as she stops the cart beside the bed, while the patient remains still with a magazine placed on their legs.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire hospital room sharp. The camera smoothly moves backward while panning left to track a woman in a white coat pushing a medical cart. The backward movement ceases, but the camera continues to pan left, revealing a patient lying in a hospital bed in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A woman with dark, styled hair, wearing a white lab coat over a red dress and dark heels, pushes a wheeled medical cart with equipment on it. She approaches a young person with light brown hair who is lying propped up in a hospital bed. The patient, dressed in white, wears a neck brace and has both legs in casts elevated on pillows. The patient's right hand is in a cast, supported by a bandage around the neck and resting on the chest, while holding a magazine or book on their lap.",
    "Motion": "A woman in a white lab coat pushes a wheeled medical cart across a hospital ward. The camera pans to follow her as she approaches a patient lying propped up in a bed. The woman stops the cart beside the bed, while the patient, who is in casts and a neck brace, remains still with a magazine placed on their legs.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set during the day inside a large, sparsely populated hospital ward. Bright light streams in through a wide bank of windows covered with white horizontal blinds. The room has light-colored linoleum flooring, white walls, and some sections of wood paneling. Several metal-framed hospital beds with white linens are positioned throughout the space. A woman with dark, styled hair, wearing a white lab coat over a red dress, pushes a tiered, wheeled metal cart carrying a piece of medical equipment. The camera follows her as she moves across the room toward a bed where a person with a neck brace is propped up on pillows, reading a magazine. Two dark-colored armchairs sit near the windows in the background.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot opens with a woman pushing a medical cart, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a hospital ward. In the background, a long bank of windows is on the left, and a deep hallway is visible on the right. The camera then pans and tracks to the left, following the woman as she moves across the room. This movement reveals a patient in a hospital bed, who comes to occupy the foreground from the left to the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
