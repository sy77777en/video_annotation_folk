  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a leopard is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the right side and the center of the frame and facing left. The camera is positioned at the leopard's level, capturing a slightly unsteady, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the leopard in the midground in focus. The leopard lies still, its mouth slightly open, breathing gently with its ears moving slightly and its body subtly shaking with each breath. Out-of-focus green leaves are visible in the foreground, primarily on the right and bottom, partially obscuring the leopard's body. The background is composed of a soft-focus blur of green foliage. The camera performs a minor upward tilt. The leopard, depicted in a close-up, side-profile view, has a tan coat with black rosettes and spots, and white fur on its chest, chin, and muzzle. It has long, white whiskers and greenish-yellow eyes, with its mouth slightly open, revealing the tip of its pink tongue. The animal is partially obscured by vibrant green leaves in the foreground, situated in an outdoor setting amidst dense, vibrant green foliage.",

The big cat has a tan coat with black rosettes and spots, and white fur on its chest, chin, and muzzle. It has long, white whiskers and greenish-yellow eyes.

    "Scene": "A leopard is situated in an outdoor setting amidst dense, vibrant green foliage. The animal, with its yellow and black spotted coat, is partially obscured by out-of-focus leaves in the foreground. The background is a soft-focus blur of more green vegetation. The leopard is seen in profile, looking toward the left, with its mouth slightly open.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
