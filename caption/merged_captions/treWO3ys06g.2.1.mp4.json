  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a motorcycle carrying two people is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, traveling forward along a narrow, wet paved road that extends from the bottom of the frame. The driver, wearing a light blue jacket and a dark helmet, is positioned in the center of the view, with a passenger, not wearing a helmet, seated directly behind. The motorcycle's single, round headlight is illuminated, casting a bright reflection on the wet surface of the road. The scene is set under a heavily overcast sky, with a thick layer of gray fog obscuring the distant rolling hills. The terrain on either side of the road consists of low hills covered in muted brown and dark green grass. On the left and right, grassy hills occupy both the foreground and middle ground, with more distant, fog-covered hills in the background. The motorcycle remains centered and in the middle ground throughout the entire shot. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves backward with a slightly unsteady motion, leading the motorcyclist down the wet road. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the rider to the distant, foggy hills in focus. The motorcycle travels forward on the wet, paved road, moving directly toward the camera, which maintains a hip-level, level angle. The vehicle remains centered in the frame as it advances along the winding road through the hilly, rural landscape.",

    "Subject": "Two people are riding a dark-colored, cruiser-style motorcycle. The driver, wearing a light blue jacket and a dark helmet, is positioned in the center of the view. A passenger, not wearing a helmet, is seated directly behind the driver. The motorcycle's single, round headlight is illuminated, casting a bright reflection on the wet surface of the road.",
    "Motion": "A motorcycle carrying a driver and a passenger travels forward on a wet, paved road, moving directly toward the camera. The vehicle remains centered in the frame as it advances along the winding road through a hilly, rural landscape.",
    "Scene": "A motorcycle with its headlight illuminated travels along a narrow, wet paved road that cuts through a desolate, rural landscape. The scene is set under a heavily overcast sky, with a thick layer of gray fog obscuring the distant rolling hills. The terrain on either side of the road consists of low hills covered in muted brown and dark green grass. The dark, wet surface of the road reflects the single bright light from the front of the motorcycle as it moves forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
