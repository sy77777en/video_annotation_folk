  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban street scene at night, capturing a broad view of the surroundings. Initially, the frame shows a bus stop sign in the upper left area, with a Gulf gas station visible in the middle ground on the right. The gas station's signage is illuminated, standing out against the dark sky. In the background, streetlights and traffic signals are scattered across the scene, illuminating the road and buildings. A parked silver sedan is initially situated slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle at eye level with a level angle, begins with the camera stationary but with noticeable shakes. The camera quickly moves forward while panning right, with the movement slightly unsteady and fast. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the right, shifting the focus more towards the gas station and the street in front of it. The gas station moves closer to the center of the frame, while the bus stop sign moves out of view. The silver sedan shifts to slightly left of the center as the camera pans. A silver minivan is parked near the gas station, and a bus is visible in the background on the left side of the frame. The camera continues to pan to the right, gradually revealing more of the gas station and the surrounding area. As the camera completes its pan, the gas station's canopy and additional vehicles become visible, showing the entire gas station and the adjacent buildings. The overall spatial composition maintains a clear view of the road, the gas station, and the surrounding urban environment, with clear weather conditions allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage.",

    "Camera": "The video features a dashcam at eye level with a level angle, utilizing deep focus. Initially stationary with noticeable shakes, the camera quickly moves forward while panning right. The movement is slightly unsteady and fast.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the atmosphere of a city at night. The emphasis is on the overall setting, including the gas station, streetlights, and surrounding streets, rather than a specific object or subject.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a nighttime scene at a gas station with a 'Gulf' sign prominently displayed. A silver minivan is parked near the gas station, and a bus is visible in the background on the left side of the frame. The camera begins to pan to the right, gradually revealing more of the gas station and the surrounding area. As the camera continues to move, the gas station's canopy and additional vehicles become visible. The camera completes its pan, showing the entire gas station and the adjacent buildings.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a well-lit intersection with a Gulf gas station prominently visible. Streetlights and traffic signals illuminate the area, casting light on the road and surrounding structures. A noticeable silver sedan is parked, and a bus is visible on the left side. In the foreground, a sign with the numbers \"273,\" \"291,\" and \"309\" is clearly visible. The camera pans to the right, revealing more parked vehicles and the entire gas station. The environment is calm, with clear weather conditions, allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage. ",

The gas station moves closer to the center of the frame, while the bus stop sign moves out of view. The silver sedan shifts to the slightly left of the center as the camera pans. The camera remains at a consistent height, likely mounted on a vehicle, providing a steady perspective throughout the video. The overall spatial composition maintains a clear view of the road, the gas station, and the surrounding urban environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
