  "merged_caption": "The video primarily shows a wide shot of an indoor room, filmed from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV. In the left foreground of the frame, a blurry person is positioned with only part of their chest-up body visible. They appear to have light-colored hair, seen from the back and side, and are wearing a light-colored top. They are holding a dark-colored smartphone in their extended hand, which is in the foreground, slightly to the right of their body, using its flashlight to illuminate the area ahead. The light from the phone projects towards the center of the frame, lighting up a dark indoor hallway that occupies the middle ground and extends into the background. Directly ahead, at the end of the hallway in the background and center, a closed white door with a small vent near its top is visible. To the right of the character, in the middle ground and on the right side of the frame, an open door is seen. Further to the right, also in the middle ground, another door is partially open. A light-colored, wall-mounted rectangular panel is positioned in the middle ground on the right wall. Adjacent to this panel, in the middle ground and to its right, a white piece of furniture is located in the bottom right corner, supporting a woven basket. Green foliage is visible in the middle ground, top right, above the panel. In the top right corner, also in the middle ground, a screen reflects the light from the smartphone. Initially, the person tilts their body and head to the right while holding the phone, then returns to their original position. Subsequently, they pan the phone to the right without moving their body and zoom back with their arm and hand to better illuminate the hallway. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. It remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movement.",

    "Subject": "The video, filmed from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, shows a blurry person in the foreground on the left side of the frame. Only the chest-up portion of this individual is visible. They appear to have light-colored hair, seen from the back and side, and are wearing a light-colored top.

    "Motion": "The person, with light-colored hair, is seen from the back and side, holding a smartphone in their extended hand and using its flashlight to illuminate a dark indoor hallway.

    "Scene": "The video, from an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character showing their chest-above body and the scene ahead, depicts a dimly lit indoor residential hallway, likely at night. The character holds a dark, rectangular smartphone, its screen casting a cool, faint light forward, illuminating the narrow passage with light-colored walls. Directly ahead, at the end of the hallway, a closed white door with a small vent near its top is visible. To the right of the character, two doors are open; the left door is fully open, while the right door is partially open. Further along the right wall, a light-colored, wall-mounted rectangular panel, possibly an electrical box, is present. Adjacent to this panel, a white piece of furniture supports a woven basket, and some green foliage is visible above the panel. Above the woven basket in the upper right corner, a screen reflects the light from the smartphone. The overall scene is dark, with the phone serving as the primary light source.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
