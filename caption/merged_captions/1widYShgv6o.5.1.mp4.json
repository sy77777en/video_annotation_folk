  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a track and field event in an indoor stadium, capturing a relay race with several athletes running, each holding a baton. In the middle ground, a man in a blue athletic outfit sprints energetically on the right side of the track, running ahead of others. Behind him, on the left of the frame, an athlete in a white and blue outfit follows closely, also carrying a baton. A third runner, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is positioned behind the second athlete, baton in hand. On the left side, a fourth athlete in a red outfit, baton in hand. All athletes maintain a steady pace, focused on the race, highlighting the competitive nature of the event. As the video progresses, the athletes move towards the right side of the frame. Initially, due to the camera's movement, their relative positions shift towards the left, but later they remain relatively unchanged. The track is marked with white lines. The video is in slow-motion, with the camera at eye level and a level angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly trucks right along the runway, tracking the runners from the side. Midway, it slightly pans left then right to realign its orientation, maintaining smooth movement with minimal shaking. In the background, spectators fill the tiered seating, with some sections more populated than others. The stadium features bright lighting, colorful banners, and digital screens displaying event information. Signboards, including a prominent \"SEIKO\" sign, line the track. The environment is vibrant, with colorful banners and digital screens displaying event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition. The scene captures the intensity and competitive nature of a track event.",

    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a track and field event in an indoor stadium. In the middle ground, athletes are running on a curved track. Initially, a man in a blue uniform is positioned on the right, running ahead of others. Behind him, on the left of the frame, three other athletes in white, yellow, and red uniforms are further behind. As the video progresses, the athletes move towards the right side of the frame. Initially, due to the camera's movement, their relative positions shift towards the left, but later they remain relatively unchanged. The track is marked with white lines. In the background, spectators fill the tiered seating, with some sections more populated than others.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
