  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot opens with an extreme wide shot from a level angle across the River Thames during what appears to be dawn or dusk. The water fills the foreground in the bottom half of the frame, beautifully reflecting the warm, dim light. In the middle ground, a section of the white structure of the London Eye, with its spherical passenger pods, is visible on the left, while the expansive, grand, classical-style facade of County Hall stretches across the center and right. A white tour boat is positioned in the middle ground, to the right of the center, in front of the building. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and performs a very smooth, slow, continuous zoom-in, moving from a wide establishing shot towards the architectural details of County Hall. This movement pushes the London Eye further to the left edge until it eventually goes out of the frame, and it completely crops the tour boat at the bottom, bringing the repeating pattern of the building's numerous windows, some of which are illuminated, to the center of the composition. The shot ends tightly focused on the building's windows, emphasizing the vastness of the structure rather than any specific detail. An overlay consisting of a stylized logo is visible in the bottom right corner throughout the shot. The scene is cast in a warm, desaturated, sepia-toned palette, establishing the grand scale of the architecture and the tranquil, atmospheric mood of the city environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a level angle at an above-water height. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a very smooth zoom-in, moving closer to the large building behind the London Eye.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a view of London from the River Thames during what appears to be dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by the grand, classical-style facade of County Hall on the riverbank, with a portion of the London Eye visible to the left. A white tour boat is moored near the bank as the water gently shimmers with reflected light, all cast in a warm, desaturated, sepia-toned palette. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on establishing the grand scale of the architecture and the tranquil, atmospheric mood of the city environment. The camera's slow zoom onto the building's repeating windows emphasizes the vastness of the structure rather than any specific detail.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of London's South Bank, featuring the River Thames and the London Eye. The camera performs a slow, continuous zoom, moving from a wide establishing shot towards the facade of the building behind the Ferris wheel. The shot ends tightly focused on the building's windows.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in London during sunset or sunrise, viewed from across the River Thames. At the beginning of the video, the water in the foreground beautifully reflects the warm, dim light. On the left, a portion of the white structure of the London Eye, with its spherical passenger pods, is visible. Across the river stands the long, stone facade of County Hall, a multi-story building with numerous windows, some of which are illuminated. A white tour boat is on the river near the bank in front of the building. The camera slowly zooms in on the architectural details of County Hall. An overlay consisting of a stylized logo is visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery shot opens with an extreme wide shot from a level angle across the River Thames. The water fills the foreground in the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, a section of the London Eye is on the left, while the expansive facade of County Hall stretches across the center and right. A tour boat is positioned in the middle ground, to the right of the center, in front of the building. The camera then executes a slow zoom, transitioning the view into a wide shot that reframes to focus on the left portion of County Hall. This movement pushes the London Eye further to the left edge until it eventually goes out of the frame, and it completely crops the tour boat at the bottom, bringing the repeating pattern of the building's windows to the center of the composition. A logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
