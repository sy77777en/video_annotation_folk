  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, showing a pregnant figure in a white garment occupying the left foreground, partially out of frame, with a metallic arm resting on the handle of a large, open, dark, textured vault door featuring a prominent wheel lock. To the right, the vault door is positioned in the middle ground. From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves forward at a level angle, focusing on the door with a shallow depth of field. As it approaches, the camera performs a quick right pan to reorient itself, causing the vault door to move into the left foreground as an out-of-focus framing element. This transition reveals a full shot of a dark room with a tiled floor, illuminated by the light from computer monitors and an additional source above, which is out of the frame. Inside, three mannequin-like figures with bald, shiny heads are seated with their backs to the camera at individual white desks, each working on a computer in a black office chair. These figures are arranged in a horizontal row, with one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right side of the frame, all viewed from behind. The camera continues its forward motion while gradually descending, transitioning to a deep focus that brings the figures into sharp view. Each figure is dressed in simple, short-sleeved t-shirts in pale shades of purple, pink, and blue, and remains stationary, focused on a computer screen. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level in both the initial and final compositions. Overlay text \"[17]\" is located at the bottom left of the frame.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves forward at a level angle. As it approaches a large vault-like door, it performs a quick right pan to reorient itself. Following the pan, the camera continues its forward motion while gradually descending. The video begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the door, before transitioning to a deep focus that brings the figures working at computers in the background into sharp view.",
    "Subject": "A pregnant figure in a white garment stands in front of an open, large, dark, textured vault door that features a prominent wheel lock. The view then shifts to reveal the room behind the door, where three mannequin-like figures are seated with their backs to the camera. These figures, which have bald, shiny heads, are positioned in a row at individual white desks. Each figure sits in a black office chair and is focused on a computer screen. They are dressed in simple, short-sleeved t-shirts in pale shades of purple, pink, and blue.",
    "Motion": "A figure in a white garment stands in front of a large, open vault door with a metallic arm resting on the handle. The camera pans to the right while moving past the figure and the door to reveal a dark room. Inside, three mannequin-like figures are seated and remain stationary at individual desks, each facing a computer screen.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, monochromatic setting, a figure in a white garment stands in front of a heavy, textured vault door featuring a large, spoked wheel handle. The view shifts to reveal the room beyond the door, which has a dark, tiled floor. Inside, three bald, mannequin-like figures are seated with their backs to the camera at separate white desks, each working on a computer in a black office chair. The dim room is illuminated by the light from the computer monitors and an additional source above, which is out of the frame. Overlay text \"[17]\" is located at the bottom left of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, showing a figure in white occupying the left foreground, partially out of frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
