  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man, identified by a name tag as \"COOPER,\" in a white and grey spacesuit with a circular \"NASA\" patch on his chest, positioned in the center foreground. He is wearing a large, dark helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is partially visible in the dim light. He appears to be a middle-aged man with medium skin. In the background, a vast, dark, and complex geometric structure, resembling an infinite, multi-dimensional lattice of endless rows of bookshelves, extends into the distance. Small, warm, out-of-focus lights are scattered throughout this structure, creating a sense of immense depth. The scene is dimly lit, with dramatic lighting illuminating parts of his suit and face while leaving much of him in shadow. The camera, from a level angle, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the spacesuit. The shot slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that tightens the frame on the man's helmet and upper torso, while he remains centered. As the camera moves smoothly forward in front of him before moving upward, the man in the spacesuit, initially facing forward, slowly turns his head to his left and slightly upwards. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, emphasizing the dramatic lighting on the front of the astronaut's suit, while the face inside the dark helmet remains mostly in shadow.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, the handheld camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the spacesuit. The camera moves smoothly forward in front of him before moving upward.",
    "Subject": "A man, identified by a name tag as \"COOPER,\" is shown from the chest up, centered and facing forward. He is wearing a white and grey spacesuit with a circular \"NASA\" patch positioned in the center of his chest. He wears a large, dark helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is partially visible in the dim light. He appears to be a middle-aged man with medium skin.

    "Motion": "A man in a spacesuit, initially facing forward, slowly turns his head to his left and slightly upwards.",
    "Scene": "An astronaut in a white spacesuit with \"NASA\" and \"COOPER\" patches is centrally positioned within a vast, dark, and complex interior space. The environment is a seemingly infinite, multi-dimensional lattice composed of what appear to be endless rows of bookshelves, extending in all directions. Small, warm, out-of-focus lights are scattered throughout this geometric structure, creating a sense of immense depth. The scene is dimly lit, with the primary illumination focused on the front of the astronaut's suit, while the face inside the dark helmet remains mostly in shadow.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in a spacesuit, who is positioned in the center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
