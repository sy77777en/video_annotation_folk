  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames two men on an interior balcony of a large, classical-style building in a state of disrepair. A Black man with a buzz cut and a serious expression occupies the left foreground, shown in profile and facing right, wearing a dark gray, long-sleeved shirt. In the right foreground, a younger, light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair, wearing a black leather jacket over a rust-colored collared shirt, faces him. The younger man speaks passionately, moving his mouth, gesturing with his right hand, moving his head, and raising his eyebrows for emphasis, while the man on the left remains stationary, listening. In the middle ground, an ornate, off-white column with gold-leafed capitals featuring sculpted faces and spiral details is positioned in the center of the frame, with a light-colored stone balustrade running along the right side. The background shows another level of the building across an atrium on the right and an archway at the end of the corridor on the left side of the frame. The floor of the walkway is scattered with small stones and dust. The walls are uniformly off-white, with lighting in shaded areas giving some parts a pale green appearance. The space is illuminated by diffuse daylight. The camera is mostly stationary but exhibits some unsteady shakiness, positioned at the subjects' level, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the two men in conversation in focus in the foreground. Although the camera is stationary, it has a slight unsteadiness, suggesting a handheld perspective. In the background, on the right side, there are some windows and off-white walls, while on the left side of the corridor, there appears to be an archway.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the two men in conversation in focus in the foreground. Although the camera is stationary, it has a slight unsteadiness, suggesting a handheld perspective.",
    "Subject": "A Black man with a buzz cut and a serious expression is shown in profile, wearing a dark gray, long-sleeved shirt. He is facing a younger, light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair. This second man wears a black leather jacket over a rust-colored collared shirt and is actively speaking, gesturing with his right hand as he talks to the first man.",
    "Motion": "A younger man on the right speaks passionately, moving his mouth, gesturing with his right hand, moving his head, and raising his eyebrows for emphasis. The man on the left remains stationary, listening to him.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on an upper-level interior balcony of a large, classical-style building in a state of disrepair. The floor of the walkway is scattered with small stones and dust. Ornate, off-white columns with gold-leafed capitals featuring sculpted faces and spiral details stand prominently. A light-colored stone balustrade lines the edge of the balcony. The walls are uniformly off-white, with lighting in shaded areas giving some parts a pale green appearance. The space is illuminated by diffuse daylight. In the background, on the right side, there are some windows and off-white walls, while on the left side of the corridor, there appears to be an archway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
