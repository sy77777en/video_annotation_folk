  "merged_caption": "The scene is a 2D representation showing a dark, stylized map of the eastern United States that occupies the entire background. The Great Lakes are visible in the upper portion of the map, and the Atlantic coastline is on the right. Faint gray lines represent roads and state borders, with state boundaries and major cities providing geographical context in a subtle gray. The label \"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE\" is positioned on the left, while \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\" is located on the right. Overlaying the map, orange text and circles identify these bases. A dashed orange line connects these two points, suggesting a path or flight trajectory. A small orange airplane icon moves steadily from left to right along this dashed line, originating near the Offut Air Force Base label and progressing towards the Joint Base Andrews label, indicating an ongoing flight. The bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons marking their positions on the map. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in on the map, emphasizing the connection between these two military bases.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
