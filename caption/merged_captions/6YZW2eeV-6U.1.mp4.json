  "merged_caption": "The video is filmed in a first-person POV, capturing three people walking through an ancient site. The person on the left is fully visible, positioned in the bottom center, slightly offset to the left of the frame, and is in the middle ground. This individual is wearing a bright orange shirt, black pants, and a blue backpack, with short dark hair, and is leading the way. The person in the center is shown from the upper body, located in the center right of the frame, in the foreground, wearing a striped shirt, a white hat, and a red backpack. The person on the right is visible from above the knees, positioned in the bottom right, and is in the foreground, wearing a blue jacket with a white and dark blue pattern, and has short hair. The stone staircase and tunnel are prominent, with textured stone walls and ceiling in the middle ground and background, suggesting an ancient or historical structure. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow passageway with rough, uneven stone surfaces in a sandy beige color. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible vegetation or water. The camera is at the subjects' height, maintaining a consistent level as they descend the staircase, with a level angle and a fixed Dutch angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, moving forward slightly unsteady with some shaking, focusing on the people walking down the stairs. The framing emphasizes the movement downwards into the stone passageway, with the ancient architecture providing context in the background. The overall atmosphere is one of exploration, with the stone architecture being the most prominent visual element.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into a stone tunnel. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow passageway with textured stone walls and ceiling, suggesting an ancient or historical structure. The stone surfaces are rough and uneven, with a sandy beige color. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible vegetation or water. The passageway leads downward, creating a sense of movement as the viewer progresses deeper into the tunnel. The overall atmosphere is one of exploration, with the stone architecture being the most prominent visual element.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
