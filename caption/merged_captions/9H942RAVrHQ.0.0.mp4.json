  "merged_caption": "A circular object is positioned in the bottom center on a gridded surface within a minimalist, monochromatic setting, where a gray perspective grid extends across a white floor against a plain white background. A black line-drawn human hand, featuring five fingers and a portion of an arm, enters from the right side of the frame, moves to the bottom center to grasp the circular drawn ball, turns upwards, and moves along the bottom and center of the frame. The hand then throws the object from the top of the frame before exiting to the right. The object appears as a circle in the top-center of the frame, falls to the bottom center, and bounces three times in the same position on the grid. With each impact, the ball briefly deforms into an oval, with the last deformation being more noticeable before it touches the surface, and then it regains its circular form. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the action on the grid throughout the video, capturing the entire sequence without any movement.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a black line-drawn human hand, featuring five fingers and a portion of an arm, interacting with a circular object. The hand grasps the object, which is then thrown. It bounces three times in the same position and briefly deforms into an oval each time as it makes contact with a gridded surface, before bouncing back up and regaining its circular form.",
    "Motion": "A black line-drawn hand with five fingers grasps a circular drawn ball. The hand turns upwards and throws the ball in the same direction before leaving the frame to the right. The ball bounces three times, deforming each time it touches the surface, with the last deformation being more noticeable before it touches the surface.",
    "Scene": "In a minimalist, monochromatic setting, a gray perspective grid extends across a white floor against a plain white background. A hand-drawn hand enters the scene to pick up a circular object from the grid. The hand then throws the object, which bounces on the gridded surface, deforming with each impact.",
    "Spatial": "A circular object is positioned in the bottom center on a gridded surface. A hand enters from the right side of the frame, moves to the bottom center to grasp the object, turns upwards, moves along the bottom and center of the frame, and then throws the object from the top of the frame before exiting to the right. The object appears as a circle in the top-center of the frame, falls to the bottom center, and bounces multiple times in the same position on the grid. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the action on the grid throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
