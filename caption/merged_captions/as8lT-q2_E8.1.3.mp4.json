  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot, captured from a level angle looking up at a massive, pyramid-shaped building that occupies the center of the frame from the bottom edge upwards. The building is positioned in the middle ground, its surface covered in a grid of glowing, greenish-cyan windows. In the top center, a small flying vehicle, known as a spinner, silhouetted against a bright orange lens flare, descends toward the pyramid's apex. Two spotlights beam upwards from the structure into the dark sky, where two small points of light are visible in the top left and top right. The background is filled with the scattered lights of a sprawling cityscape on the lower left and right. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it slowly moves forward over the futuristic cityscape. As the clip progresses, a new spotlight beam appears to originate from another flying vehicle entering the frame and sweeps backward. The video presents a striking cityscape scenery shot, characterized by a vast, illuminated urban environment at night. The focus is on the intricate patterns of lights emanating from the buildings, creating a mesmerizing tapestry that highlights the scale and complexity of the city. A large aircraft with bright yellow taillights flies in from the top of the frame, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The dark, stepped structure of the pyramid is covered in a dense grid of glowing windows, creating a complex, illuminated pattern against the dark sky. Powerful spotlights beam upwards from the building, while the sprawling city extends into the distance as a sea of scattered lights. Another bright light, possibly a searchlight from another vehicle, sweeps across the sky from the right side of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, slow-moving aerial shot with a level angle, moving forward over a futuristic cityscape. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a striking cityscape scenery shot, characterized by a vast, illuminated urban environment at night. A large aircraft with bright yellow taillights flies in from the top of the frame, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The focus is on the intricate patterns of lights emanating from the buildings, creating a mesmerizing tapestry that highlights the scale and complexity of the city. There is no main subject, as the emphasis lies on the overall atmosphere and the interplay of light and shadow, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the grandeur of the urban landscape rather than fixating on a specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide shot of the Tyrell Corporation pyramid from the film *Blade Runner*. The camera slowly moves forward as a small flying vehicle, known as a spinner, descends toward a landing pad at the very top of the massive, city-like structure. Another bright light, possibly a searchlight from another vehicle, sweeps across the sky from the right side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime view of a massive, pyramid-shaped building in a futuristic cityscape. The dark, stepped structure is covered in a dense grid of glowing, greenish-cyan windows, creating a complex, illuminated pattern against the dark sky. Powerful spotlights beam upwards from the building. A small, dark flying vehicle descends toward the apex of the pyramid, silhouetted against a bright, orange lens flare, while the sprawling city extends into the distance as a sea of scattered lights.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
