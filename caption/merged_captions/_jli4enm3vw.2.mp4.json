  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a human tower being constructed in the center-middle ground of a narrow street, framed by beige buildings in the background. The scene is viewed from the perspective of the crowd, with the back of a man in a pink shirt occupying the left foreground at the start. The viewpoint then shifts slightly, bringing the head and shoulder of a woman into the left foreground. The camera remains at the level of the crowd throughout the shot, providing a slightly unsteady, fixed shot from an eye-level, low-angle perspective, looking up at the human tower. The camera attempts to use deep focus, but the figures in the foreground appear slightly blurred. A multi-level human tower advances forward along the street, supported by a large group at its base. The lower levels of the tower and the surrounding crowd are in constant motion, working together to maintain the structure as they progress. The tower is surrounded by a large group of participants and spectators in the middle ground. A red and white circular sign is positioned in the right middle ground. The main subject of the video is a group of people, primarily men, constructing a human tower on a street. These individuals wear a uniform consisting of blue long-sleeved shirts, white trousers, and a wide black sash tied around their waists. The tower is several levels high, with each person standing on the shoulders of the people below, and is topped by a small child also wearing a blue shirt. A large crowd of men and women surrounds the tower, with many wearing the same blue and white uniform, actively supporting the base or watching. Storefronts are visible at street level, and a red and white circular \"No Entry\" sign is posted on a pole.",

    "Scene": "This daytime scene takes place on a narrow, crowded street lined with multi-story, beige-colored buildings featuring dark, wrought-iron balconies. In the center of the street, a group of people wearing blue shirts, white pants, and sashes forms a multi-level human tower. The surrounding crowd of spectators watches the event unfold. Storefronts are visible at street level, and a red and white circular \"No Entry\" sign is posted on a pole.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
