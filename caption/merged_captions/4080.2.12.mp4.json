  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a person wearing a camouflage-patterned long-sleeved shirt and matching pants sits stationary in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a grassy incline. They wear a beanie with a blue design and yellow geometric highlights and look down while turning their head from their right to their left. Just behind the seated person, more grasses are visible. To the right, another person with long, dark hair, wearing blue jeans, starts in the foreground and gradually moves away from the camera, exiting the frame on the right in the middle ground. On the far left, a third individual in the middle ground walks out of the shot to the left. The foreground is composed of out-of-focus grass, dirt, and dead leaves at the bottom of the frame, with a dense, blurry forest in the background. The scene is set in a wooded area at dusk, characterized by cool, low lighting. A dense forest with tall, slender trees, many with bare branches, forms the background against a pale blue sky. From a smooth, ground-level position, the camera maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field to keep the person sitting in the foreground in focus. As the camera moves backward while zooming in on the person, some of the trees in the background warp unnaturally due to camera distortion.",

    "Subject": "A person wearing a camouflage-patterned long-sleeved shirt and matching pants sits on the ground, looking down. They wear a beanie with a blue design and yellow geometric highlights. To the right, another person with long, dark hair, wearing blue jeans, is seen from behind as they walk away. A third individual is visible in the shadows on the left side of the frame, walking out of the shot to the left.",
    "Motion": "A person in camouflage sits still on the ground in a wooded area, looking down while turning their head from their right to their left. To their right, another person walks away from the camera, moving toward the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, a third person on the left walks out of the frame to the left.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a wooded area at dusk, characterized by cool, low lighting. A dense forest with tall, slender trees, many with bare branches, forms the background against a pale blue sky. The ground is a mixture of green grass, weeds, and scattered brown leaves. In the center of the clearing, a person wearing camouflage clothing sits on a small, grassy incline. To the right, another individual is partially visible, walking away into the woods. To the left of the person sitting, a third individual is walking out of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
