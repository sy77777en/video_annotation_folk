  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man with short dark hair and a light skin tone, wearing a dark blue shirt. He is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, captured from the shoulders up, and occupying the foreground. The indoor setting features neutral-colored walls and minimal decor, with soft lighting enhancing his facial features and creating a calm, introspective atmosphere. Initially, the man has his eyes closed, and as the frames progress, he opens his eyes and looks directly towards the camera, suggesting a moment of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The camera showcases a dynamic movement with a low angle, looking up, and an extremely shallow depth of field that focuses on the man. It moves forward while zooming out, maintaining smooth and slow motion throughout. The man lowers his head slightly, then raises it to look forward, lowers it again, and finally slightly raises it at the end of the sequence, maintaining a calm and contemplative expression. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with subdued lighting. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, ensuring a steady and direct view of the subject. The overlay text \"而是这一刻\" appears briefly at the bottom left of the frame, maintaining the focus on the subject's contemplative state. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the person's expression, with the time of day indeterminate due to the controlled indoor lighting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective, with no significant change in the shot size or the subject's position within the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
