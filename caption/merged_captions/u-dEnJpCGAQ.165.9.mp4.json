  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured at subject level, shows an adult elephant and a baby elephant in the middle ground amidst dense, tall green grass and foliage that fills the foreground and background. The adult elephant, with its grey, wrinkled skin, occupies the center of the frame, while the baby, also with grey, wrinkled skin, stands beneath it. The baby elephant is facing away from the viewer, with its rear visible, and appears to be nursing from the adult. A patch of lighter-colored plants is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera remains static but slightly unsteady, taken from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, using a deep focus to keep the mother and baby elephant, along with the surrounding dense foliage, in sharp detail. The adult elephant stands mostly still, making slight movements with its ears, while the baby elephant continuously wags its tail back and forth, making small shifts in its stance. The scene is set in a lush, natural environment during the day, with the gray, textured skin of the elephants contrasting with the surrounding greenery. The large adult elephant is partially concealed by the thick undergrowth, while the smaller calf stands close to its side.",

    "Subject": "An adult elephant and a baby elephant are seen amidst tall, dense green grass and foliage. The large adult elephant, with its grey, wrinkled skin, is positioned with its side to the viewer, partially concealed by the vegetation. Standing beside and slightly underneath the adult is a much smaller baby elephant, also with grey, wrinkled skin. The baby elephant is facing away from the viewer, with its rear visible, and appears to be nursing from the adult.",
    "Motion": "An adult elephant stands mostly still amidst tall green grass, making slight movements with its ears. A baby elephant stands beside it, continuously wagging its tail back and forth while making small shifts in its stance.",
    "Scene": "From a slightly elevated perspective, an adult elephant and a calf are seen amidst a dense expanse of tall, vibrant green grass and leafy foliage. The large, gray adult elephant is partially concealed by the thick undergrowth, while the smaller calf stands close to its side. The scene is set in a lush, natural environment during the day, with the gray, textured skin of the elephants contrasting with the surrounding greenery.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured at subject level, shows an adult elephant and a baby elephant in the middle ground. The adult elephant occupies the center of the frame, while the baby stands beneath it. They are surrounded by dense, tall green grass and foliage that fills the foreground and background. A patch of lighter-colored plants is visible in the bottom-left foreground. Although the camera remains static, there is a slight unsteadiness throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
