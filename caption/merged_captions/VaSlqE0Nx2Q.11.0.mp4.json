  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two main subjects in a starkly lit, black-and-white scene. Initially, the young boy with dark, curly hair and a striped jacket is positioned on the left side of the frame, in the middle ground, facing right in profile. Beside him, in the center of the frame, stands another figure with their head wrapped in wire or string, also in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing their upper bodies. The boy turns his head to face forward, changing his expression to wide-eyed, while the second figure remains still. The scene is framed with a dark, out-of-focus shoulder in the foreground on the right, indicating an over-the-shoulder perspective. The background remains pitch-black, emphasizing the focused light on the subjects. A single, focused light source from the right illuminates the two figures against the pitch-black background. The camera uses shallow focus, concentrating on the two individuals in the middle ground. The young boy, initially seen in profile looking to his left, turns his head to face forward with a wide-eyed expression. The figure beside him, whose head is wrapped in wire, remains motionless throughout the scene. The static, eye-level shot is filmed from a level angle, maintaining a consistent focus on the subjects. The dark, out-of-focus shoulder of the viewpoint character is visible in the foreground, enhancing the over-the-shoulder perspective. The stark lighting and black-and-white composition create a dramatic and undefined space, with the boy's expression changing as he looks up with wide eyes. The second figure, wearing a dark, thick coat, remains still, with their facial features completely obscured by the dense wrapping of string-like or wire-like material.",

He is initially in profile, then turns to look forward with a wide-eyed expression. To his left, in the center of the frame, stands another person whose entire head is completely wrapped in what appears to be wire or string, obscuring all facial features.

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the black-and-white shot is set in a dark, undefined space. A single, focused light source from the right illuminates two figures against a pitch-black background. On the left, a young boy in a ribbed jacket is seen in profile, looking towards the right. Beside him is a figure wearing a dark coat, whose head is completely obscured by a dense wrapping of a string-like or wire-like material. The dark, out-of-focus shoulder of the viewpoint character is visible in the foreground. The boy's expression changes as he looks up with wide eyes.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
