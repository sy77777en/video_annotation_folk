  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. His head occupies the majority of the central area, and he has a wide, open-mouthed expression, suggesting he might be speaking or reacting to something. The video is set in a dark environment, likely at night or in a dimly lit indoor space, with several out-of-focus, circular lights visible in the background, primarily scattered across the top portion of the frame. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, and the small, bright lights in the background further indicate a nighttime setting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level with a low angle, looking up, and employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. Initially, he is not directly facing the camera, but as the video progresses, he turns his head to his right. The camera arcs clockwise around him, tracking his movement, and adjusts to follow his head's slight movement within the frame. Despite the low light partially obscuring his facial features, his expression remains the focal point throughout the video. The motion is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, but his overall position and the shot size remain constant.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
