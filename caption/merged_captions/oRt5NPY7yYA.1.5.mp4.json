  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a convoy of vehicles travels diagonally across the frame from the bottom right toward the top left. The entire formation is situated in the middle ground, moving along a paved road that cuts through an arid desert landscape. A police-style SUV leads the convoy at the upper left, followed by three dark green, boxy, armored tactical vehicles with angular designs and roof mounts, a central semi-truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, white, rectangular, windowless trailer, two more armored vehicles, and a final police SUV bringing up the rear toward the bottom right. The desert terrain extends from the foreground to the background, while distant rocky hills line the background at the top of the frame under a bright, clear sky. The camera, from a high, overhead angle, smoothly side-tracks the convoy, maintaining a consistent position relative to the vehicles as they move forward at a uniform speed across two lanes on a straight paved road. The camera gradually zooms out, causing the convoy to appear smaller in the frame, while maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The daytime sun casts long, distinct shadows from the vehicles onto the asphalt as they proceed through the landscape. The surrounding environment is characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain and sparse green scrub. The convoy, moving in a single file line, is captured by a drone as it travels along a paved, four-lane highway, with two lanes designated for each direction of travel, cutting through the vast desert.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly side-tracks a convoy consisting of a semi-trailer, police vehicles, and military vehicles. It moves diagonally toward the top left of the frame while gradually zooming out, causing the convoy to appear smaller in the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A convoy of highly detailed 3D-rendered vehicles travels in a single file line down a paved road. At the center of the formation is a large semi-trailer truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, white, rectangular, windowless trailer. Escorting this truck are five dark green, boxy, armored tactical vehicles, three positioned in front of the truck and two behind. These armored vehicles have an angular design and what appears to be a turret or mount on the roof. A black and white police-style SUV leads the convoy, and another similar police vehicle brings up the rear.",
    "Motion": "A convoy of vehicles, including two police-style SUVs, five armored tactical vehicles, and a semi-truck, travels in a linear formation across two lanes on a straight paved road through a desert. All vehicles move forward at a uniform speed, maintaining their formation. The camera follows the convoy from an aerial perspective, slowly zooming out to encompass the entire procession as it moves through the landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a convoy of vehicles traveling along a paved, four-lane highway, with two lanes designated for each direction of travel, cutting through a vast, arid desert. The surrounding environment is characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain, sparse green scrub, and distant rocky hills under a bright, clear sky. The convoy, moving in a single file line, consists of a large, white rectangular container on a truck, escorted by several dark, blocky armored vehicles and two black-and-white cars, which appear to be police vehicles. The daytime sun casts long, distinct shadows from the vehicles onto the asphalt as they proceed through the landscape.",

The camera tracks alongside the convoy, maintaining a consistent position relative to the vehicles as they move forward."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
