  "merged_caption": "The video frames a dense field of small, glowing blue dots distributed throughout three-dimensional space, with the majority of dots and connecting lines converging toward a central vanishing point located at the center of the frame and in the background. The dots are dispersed across the entire frame, occupying the left, right, top, and bottom edges, and extend from the background through the middle ground to the foreground, creating a tunnel-like effect. Faint linear connections between the dots radiate outward from the central point, reinforcing the sense of depth and perspective. The camera appears to be positioned at the same height as the central vanishing point, looking directly toward it, which emphasizes the symmetrical arrangement and the receding lines. The small, glowing blue dots move steadily along straight paths that radiate outward from the central vanishing point, creating the effect of lines and patterns expanding through three-dimensional space. As the video progresses, the dots shift position, maintaining their geometric arrangement while gradually spreading farther apart, which enhances the sense of depth and motion toward and away from the center. The video features artificially created moving light dots, making it unclear whether the camera itself is moving. The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. The overall arrangement gives the impression of a digital or abstract network, with the dots connected by faint, linear paths that radiate outward. The background is dark, which enhances the brightness and clarity of the blue elements. The overall scene is dynamic, with the dots and lines shifting and converging, giving a sense of continuous motion through a virtual or futuristic space. There are no recognizable people, animals, or conventional objects; the primary subjects are these luminous points and their geometric organization, which together create a visually complex and abstract scene.",

    "Subject": "The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming lines and patterns that converge toward a central vanishing point. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, creating a sense of depth and perspective.

    "Motion": "The small, glowing blue dots move steadily along straight paths that radiate outward from a central vanishing point, creating the effect of lines and patterns expanding through three-dimensional space. As the video progresses, the dots shift position, maintaining their geometric arrangement while gradually spreading farther apart, which enhances the sense of depth and motion toward and away from the center.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an abstract, digital environment filled with countless small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, creating the impression of depth and movement. These dots are connected by faint lines, forming geometric patterns that radiate outward from a central point, resembling a tunnel or a starburst effect. The background is dark, which enhances the brightness and clarity of the blue elements. The overall scene is dynamic, with the dots and lines shifting and converging, giving a sense of continuous motion through a virtual or futuristic space. There are no discernible natural or architectural features, and the setting is entirely digital, with a focus on the interplay of light, color, and geometric forms.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
