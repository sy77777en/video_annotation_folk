  "merged_caption": "The video features two framed scenes, each containing full shots of people, moving horizontally across a black background. Initially, the first framed scene is positioned on the center-left side of the screen. Within this first frame, a man with light skin and short, light-colored hair stands in the center middle ground, behind a large polished wooden desk in the foreground. He wears a white, long-sleeved collared shirt, a plain red tie, and dark trousers, with his hands placed on his hips. To his left is a light brown leather office chair in the middle ground, with a dark coat draped over it, and on the further right of the scene, a window with the presidential seal is visible in the background. A door is seen to his left in the background. The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field and appears to primarily pan right to shift focus from one photo to the next, with the movement being very smooth. There is mild barrel distortion present in the photos. The scene transitions through a series of screen-like frames sliding to the left, revealing another scene where a man and a woman are seen from the back in the center middle ground, walking away down a carpeted aisle inside the same aircraft. The man, on the left, wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and dark trousers, with his right arm around the woman's shoulders. The woman, on the right, wears a dark, long-sleeved top or jacket. They walk past beige upholstered seats lining the right side of the aisle in the middle ground, with aircraft windows visible in the background. The second framed scene slides in from the right, pushing the first frame further to the left, and settles on the left side of the screen.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a well-furnished office inside an aircraft, featuring a large wooden desk, a leather office chair, and a window with the presidential seal. The scene transitions through a series of screen-like frames sliding to the left, revealing another scene where a man and a woman walk down an aisle inside the same aircraft. The man has his arm around the woman's shoulders as they walk past comfortable seating.",
    "Scene": "The video displays two distinct scenes, each presented within a dark, box-like frame against a black background. Both scenes are set inside an aircraft, featuring light-colored walls, carpeted floors, and characteristic oval windows. The first framed scene reveals an office space where a man in a white shirt and red tie stands behind a substantial, polished dark wood desk, accompanied by a light brown leather office chair with a black coat draped over it; a circular seal is visible on a nearby window. The second framed scene shows a man and a woman walking away down a carpeted aisle of the aircraft, with a long, light-colored sofa lining one side.",

In this second frame, a man and a woman are seen from the back in the center middle ground, walking away down an aisle that extends from foreground to background. Beige upholstered seats line the right side of the aisle in the middle ground, with aircraft windows visible in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
