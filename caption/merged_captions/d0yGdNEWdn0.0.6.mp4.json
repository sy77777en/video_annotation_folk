  "merged_caption": "A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short brown hair and a full, trimmed beard and mustache stands in the center of the frame in a medium shot, occupying the foreground. He is wearing a light blue button-down shirt with a red lanyard around his neck, from which a name tag is hanging. A small black microphone is clipped to his collar. The scene is set indoors in a presentation room, with a solid, dark red wall visible behind him. To the left side of the frame is a light-colored wooden lectern, and to the right is a large, white projection screen. The man maintains his position throughout the shot, gesturing with both hands as he speaks. He holds a small black object, likely a presentation remote, in his right hand, moving his hands apart and then together in front of his chest to emphasize his words. He occasionally presses the remote in his right hand while his left hand remains open. The camera is slightly shaky and positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera remains fixed on the speaker, capturing his gestures and movements as he talks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
