  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot showing a man in dark, heavy clothing and armor crouched near the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a sword embedded upright in the ground to his left (frame right, middle ground). The man’s posture is low and alert, with his body angled forward and one arm extended slightly behind him, and both he and the sword are clearly visible against the snowy, uneven forest floor. The background consists of tall, leafless trees silhouetted against a dim, bluish light that filters through the misty air, filling the upper and side areas in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a large depth of field. As the scene progresses, the camera briefly moves forward toward the man, then quickly pulls back and pans right as he raises his arms into a position as if holding a ball, preparing to attack. A bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the left-center middle ground, casting illumination across the scene and creating strong contrasts between lit and shadowed areas, highlighting the metallic surfaces of the man’s armor and the sword. The ground is uneven and covered with patches of snow or frost, reflecting the limited light. The atmosphere is heavy and still, with the burst of light casting long shadows and increasing the visible distance between the man, the sword, and the surrounding trees. Throughout, the man and sword remain in the middle ground, while the burst of light and trees occupy the middle ground and background, and the camera maintains its height relative to the subjects. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera briefly moves forward toward the game character, then quickly pulls back and pans right as the character prepares to attack. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man dressed in dark, heavy clothing and armor, with a helmet that obscures his face and metallic elements on his arms, giving him a menacing and battle-ready appearance. He is positioned in a crouched stance, suggesting alertness or preparation for action. Near him, a sword with a long, straight blade and a crossguard is embedded upright in the ground, its hilt and blade reflecting light. The man’s attire and the sword’s placement create a striking visual contrast, emphasizing the sense of tension and readiness. Additionally, a bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the scene, casting a dramatic glow and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the man’s armor and the sword.",
    "Motion": "The man remains in a low crouched stance, holding his position with his body angled forward and one arm extended slightly behind him. As a sudden, bright burst of blue-white light appears and expands in the scene, illuminating the man and the sword, he raises his arms into a position as if he is holding a ball. The sword stays upright and stationary in the ground nearby.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a dense, dark forest at night, with tall, leafless trees silhouetted against a dim, bluish light that filters through the misty air. The ground is uneven and covered with patches of snow or frost, creating a cold, textured surface that reflects the limited light. A figure stands near the center, partially crouched, with a metallic object or weapon visible beside them, both appearing dark and matte with sharp, angular shapes. The atmosphere is heavy and still, with a faint glow or burst of blue-white light illuminating part of the scene, casting long shadows and creating a stark contrast between the illuminated and shadowed areas. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot showing a man in armor crouched near the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a sword embedded upright in the ground to his left (frame right, middle ground). The man’s posture is low and alert, and both he and the sword are clearly visible against the snowy, uneven forest floor. The background consists of tall, leafless trees stretching vertically across the frame, filling the upper and side areas in the background. The camera is positioned at the same height as the man, maintaining a level perspective. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, pulling back to reveal more of the forest environment and increasing the visible distance between the man, the sword, and the surrounding trees. A bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the left-center middle ground, casting illumination across the scene and creating strong contrasts between lit and shadowed areas. Throughout, the man and sword remain in the middle ground, while the burst of light and trees occupy the middle ground and background, and the camera maintains its height relative to the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
