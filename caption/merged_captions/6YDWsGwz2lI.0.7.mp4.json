  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman with light-colored hair, wearing a black coat, walking away from the camera. Her upper body is visible in the bottom center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a slightly low angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly tail-tracks the woman as she walks forward, slightly trucking right while panning left to keep her centered. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with those on the left extending from the foreground to the background, and those on the right extending from the middle ground to the background, with their facades extending vertically. The street is flanked by these tall, imposing buildings, characterized by a mix of modern and older stone architecture with intricate details visible on some facades. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky is overcast with a soft, diffused light. Streetlights are positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cooler tones of the buildings and pavement. A few cars are seen on the road, and some bicycles are parked along the sidewalk, contributing to the urban landscape. The camera follows her closely from behind, maintaining her as the central subject while capturing the movement of the city around her. The overall atmosphere is calm, with minimal movement, and the scene maintains a consistent urban aesthetic throughout, providing a comprehensive view of the street's architecture and atmosphere.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an urban street scene in a city with tall, imposing buildings lining both sides of the road. The setting is outdoors, and the time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky is overcast with a soft, diffused light. The architecture is characterized by a mix of modern and older stone buildings, with intricate details visible on some facades. The street is relatively quiet, with a few cars and bicycles visible, and a pedestrian walking along the sidewalk. Streetlights cast a warm glow, contrasting with the cooler tones of the buildings and pavement. The overall atmosphere is calm, with minimal movement, and the scene maintains a consistent urban aesthetic throughout.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. Her upper body is visible in the bottom center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera follows her at her height, maintaining her as the central subject. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with those on the left extending from the foreground to the background, and those on the right extending from the middle ground to the background, with their facades extending vertically. Streetlights are positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right, casting a warm glow.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
