  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an upside-down full shot, positioning a dark-skinned man in a bright yellow hoodie on the left of the frame in the foreground and a second person with long, dark hair in dark clothing on the right of the frame in the foreground, both on a large, ornate rug featuring a complex pattern in shades of red, gold, and dark blue that fills the middle ground. The man in the hoodie is crouched, holding a cigarette in his right hand, and exhaling a plume of white smoke or vapor while wearing a gold watch on his right wrist. The camera then smoothly cranes upward in an arc, rotating from an inverted orientation to a 90-degree bird's-eye view from eye level, looking down on the people below. In this final framing, the man in the hoodie is now located in the bottom left, looking up toward the camera, moving his head and upper body, while the other individual is in the bottom right of the frame, kneeling mostly still with one arm outstretched. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit room at night, shrouded in deep shadows, with a focused spotlight illuminating the central area. A red circular object and a black case rest on the patterned surface of the rug. A deep focus keeps the entire scene clear throughout the movement.",

    "Camera": "This video begins with an upside-down, hip-level shot. The camera then smoothly cranes upward in an arc, rotating to a bird's-eye view from eye level that looks down on the people below. A deep focus keeps the entire scene clear throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit scene viewed from a high angle, a dark-skinned man in a bright yellow hoodie is crouched and looking up toward the camera. The hood is pulled over his head, and he is exhaling a plume of smoke or vapor while wearing a gold watch on his right wrist. To his right, a person with long, dark hair and wearing dark clothing is kneeling on a patterned rug with one arm extended.",
    "Motion": "The scene rotates from an inverted orientation to a high-angle, top-down view. A man in a yellow hoodie, crouched on the floor, holds a cigarette in his right hand and exhales a plume of smoke before looking up, moving his head and upper body. To his left, another person kneels on a rug, remaining mostly still with one arm outstretched.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, the scene unfolds in a dimly lit room at night. The floor is almost entirely covered by a large, ornate rug featuring a complex pattern in shades of red, gold, and dark blue. The space is shrouded in deep shadows, with a focused spotlight illuminating the central area. Within this circle of light, a person in a bright yellow hooded sweatshirt crouches, exhaling a plume of white smoke. Another individual is likely kneeling on the floor, mostly obscured by the darkness. A red circular object and a black case also rest on the patterned surface of the rug.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with an upside-down full shot, positioning a man in a yellow hoodie on the left of the frame in the foreground and a second person in dark clothing on the right of the frame in the foreground, both on a patterned rug that fills the middle ground. The camera then smoothly cranes upward in an arc, transitioning to a 90-degree bird's-eye view from eye level, looking down on the people below. In this final framing, the man in the hoodie is now located in the bottom left, looking up toward the camera, while the other individual is in the bottom right of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
