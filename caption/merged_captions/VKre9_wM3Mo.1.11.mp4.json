  "merged_caption": "This wide shot begins with two semi-transparent, glowing white toilets positioned on a dark, reflective surface. The toilet on the left, closer to the camera, is fully visible at the start and gradually disappears from the left side of the frame as the camera, positioned at hip level, smoothly dollies forward. In the center middle ground, another toilet is shown in an exploded view, with its components—the bowl, tank, and open lid—floating separately. As the camera moves forward, these components lower and assemble into a complete unit, with the lid connecting to the tank to form a stationary toilet. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style, with the reflective black floor showing grayish-white reflections and black shadows. The text \"Washdown toilet\" appears in the lower-left corner before the central toilet becomes fully assembled, and the text \"[1,2,3,4]\" is consistently displayed in the bottom-left corner throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The camera, positioned at hip level, maintains a level angle as it smoothly dollies forward toward the toilet, which is centered in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of this animated video is a semi-transparent, glowing white toilet that assembles itself in the center of a dark, reflective space. Initially, its components—the bowl, tank, and open lid—are shown floating apart before coming together to form a complete unit. To the left and slightly in the foreground, another toilet with a similar ghostly, semi-transparent white appearance is fully visible at the start and gradually disappears from the left side of the frame. The text \"[1,2,3,4]\" is consistently displayed in the bottom left corner throughout the video. Before the central toilet becomes fully assembled, the white text \"Washdown toilet\" appears in the lower-left corner.",
    "Motion": "A semi-transparent toilet on the left slides out of the frame as the camera moves forward. In the center, the separate, floating components of another toilet—the bowl, tank, and lid—move together and assemble. The lid lowers from above to connect with the tank, forming a complete, stationary toilet.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, minimalist setting with a reflective black floor, two semi-transparent, glowing white toilets are visible. The floor's reflection appears grayish-white, with some areas showing black shadows. The toilet in the center is initially shown in an exploded view, with its lid and tank cover floating above the bowl. These components then lower into place to form a complete toilet. To the left, another toilet of similar appearance is initially visible but disappears from view as the camera moves forward. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Washdown toilet\" in white, and another overlay displays the text \"[1,2,3,4]\" in white.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot begins with two toilets positioned on a reflective surface. The toilet on the left is closer to the camera at the beginning, while another toilet is in the center middle ground with its components floating separately. As the shot progresses, the components of the central toilet lower and assemble into a complete unit. Simultaneously, the toilet on the left moves out of the frame. The text \"Washdown toilet\" appears before the components assemble into a complete unit and remains in the bottom-left corner, while the text \"[1,2,3,4]\" remains in the bottom-left corner throughout. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
