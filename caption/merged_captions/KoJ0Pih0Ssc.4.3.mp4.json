  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle close-up, where a spiked metal grid extends from the bottom of the frame into the background on reddish-brown, sandy ground. A tall, grey concrete wall runs along the right side, featuring large grid-like lines, while anti-tank obstacles stretch from the middle ground into the background on the left. The camera starts at ground level with a high angle, looking down at the spiked grids, with a shallow focus highlighting the grids in the foreground. After three seconds, the camera slowly moves forward, pans slightly to the left, and tilts upward, raising its height to hip level and transitioning to a low angle that looks up at a signal fence. This motion reveals a chain-link fence with metal posts and dark, metallic, X-shaped Czech hedgehog anti-tank obstacles on the left. As the camera continues to move forward, the focus transitions to deep, bringing the entire scene into sharp view. The shot transitions to a wider view, where the spiked grid is no longer visible, and only one anti-tank obstacle is present in the bottom left corner. A chain-link fence extends from the left foreground into the distance, with a guard tower and several multi-story urban buildings visible in the background under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The shot settles on a low-angle perspective looking up toward the sky, as a blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower center of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, forward-moving shot that begins at ground level with a high angle, looking down at spiked grids. The focus is initially shallow, highlighting the grids in the foreground. After three seconds, the camera starts to pan left and tilt upward, raising its height to hip level and shifting to a low angle that looks up at a signal fence. As it tilts, the focus transitions to deep, bringing the entire scene into sharp view.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a heavily fortified border area, beginning with a close-up of a long, rectangular metal grid laid on reddish-brown, sandy ground. Numerous sharp, nail-like spikes protrude vertically from this grid. To the right is a tall, grey concrete wall featuring large grid-like lines running across it. As the perspective widens, the full extent of the fortifications is revealed, including a line of dark, metallic, X-shaped Czech hedgehog anti-tank obstacles beyond the chain-link fence with metal posts, which is identified by the on-screen text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" in a blue box. In the distant background, a guard tower and several multi-story urban buildings are visible under a bright, cloudy sky.",
    "Motion": "The camera begins with a high-angle, close-up view of a spike strip on the ground. It then slowly moves forward and pans slightly to the left, tilting upward as it progresses along a fortified border. This motion reveals a tall concrete wall on the right and a chain-link fence with anti-tank obstacles on the left. The camera continues to move forward, framing the full height of the fence against the sky.",
    "Scene": "This outdoor daytime scene is set along a high, grey concrete wall on sandy ground. In the foreground, a long strip of wire mesh with upward-pointing spikes is laid on the ground. Parallel to this, a line of dark, metallic Czech hedgehog obstacles and a chain-link fence extend into the distance, where city buildings and a guard tower are visible under a bright, partly cloudy sky. As the view tilts upward, a blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower portion of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a high-angle close-up, where a spiked metal grid extends from the bottom of the frame into the background. A tall concrete wall runs along the right side, and anti-tank obstacles stretch from the middle ground into the background on the left. The camera moves forward, pans left, and tilts upward, transitioning to a wider shot. In the final frame, the spiked grid is not visible; only one anti-tank obstacle is present in the bottom left corner. A chain-link fence extends from the left foreground into the distance, with a guard tower and city buildings visible in the background. The shot settles on a low-angle perspective looking up toward the sky, as a text overlay reading \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower center."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
