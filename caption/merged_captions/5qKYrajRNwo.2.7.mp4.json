  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot focusing on the bare feet of a young girl, positioned in the top center of the frame. Initially, her feet are in the background, but as the scene progresses, she moves into the middle ground. The camera, capturing this stop-motion animation from a high, overhead angle, performs a smooth, minor zoom-out. The focus begins with a shallow depth of field, initially keeping the textured, multicolored floor in sharp focus, which features earthy tones like brown, yellow, and red. It then transitions to a rack focus, blurring the floor and concentrating on the girl as she looks up. As she walks forward, revealing her full figure, she maintains her gaze straight ahead in the general direction of the camera and stops just short of it. The girl is shown to be an animated character, possibly a puppet, with dark skin, large brown eyes, thick eyebrows, and dark hair styled in two long braids. She is wearing a dark blue pinafore dress over a white, short-sleeved collared shirt. Metal dishes are visible to the top left and a stack of folded fabrics to the top right, both in the middle ground. A blurry element is visible in the extreme foreground at the bottom of the screen. The environment is dimly lit, suggesting a cozy, intimate atmosphere, with objects such as a cup, a stack of metal dish plates, and a stack of fabrics nearby, adding to the lived-in feel of the space. The setting conveys a sense of warmth and familiarity, with the focus on the interaction between the figure and the surrounding elements.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a high-angle shot showing the bare feet of a young girl standing on a dark, uneven floor. As the view reveals more of her, she is shown to be an animated character, possibly a puppet, with dark skin. She has large brown eyes, thick eyebrows, and dark hair styled in two long braids. The girl is wearing a dark blue pinafore dress over a white, short-sleeved collared shirt. She gazes straight ahead in the general direction of the camera with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle view, the bare feet of an animated girl are shown. The camera slightly zooms out as she walks forward, revealing her full figure. She maintains her gaze straight ahead in the general direction of the camera and stops just short of it.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, featuring a textured, multicolored floor with a mix of earthy tones like brown, yellow, and red. The environment is dimly lit, suggesting a cozy, intimate atmosphere. A small figure with braided hair and a simple outfit stands on the floor, gazing straight ahead in the general direction of the camera. Nearby, there are objects such as a cup, a stack of metal dish plates, and a stack of fabrics, adding to the lived-in feel of the space. The setting conveys a sense of warmth and familiarity, with the focus on the interaction between the figure and the surrounding elements.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a high-angle shot focusing on the bare feet of a girl, positioned in the top center of the frame. Initially, her feet are in the background, but as the scene progresses, she moves into the middle ground. The camera then captures her fully as she looks up, with metal dishes to the top left and a stack of folded fabrics to the top right, both in the middle ground. A blurry element is visible in the extreme foreground at the bottom of the screen."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
