  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a group of men occupies the center of the frame, walking forward along a paved walkway situated between two long, identical, single-story buildings with white walls and red-tiled roofs, lined with large, brown, grid-like ventilation units. The scene is set during the day under an overcast sky. In the foreground, there are four individuals: a man with medium-length, dark, wavy hair in a dark blue blazer on the left, a man in a blue suit with a green tie and a beard second from the left, a man in a black coat over a white collared shirt second from the right, and a tall man with dark hair in a black coat on the far right. In the middle ground and background, additional men and a small child in a red sweater walk behind the main group. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves backward smoothly, leading the group as they advance, maintaining their central position within the frame. A deep focus is used, keeping both the men and the background environment in sharp detail. As the group walks forward, the man in the blue suit initially faces the man in the black coat in the center, speaking to him, before turning his head to face forward. The tall man on the right walks steadily, while the man with medium-length hair on the left initially walks with his hand near his mouth, then lowers his hand and turns his head to look to his left. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays white text that reads, \"Çiftlik Bank - Mavi Yumurta Sakarya Tesisi Açılış Klibi (2017)\".",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a smooth, hip-level perspective with a level angle. The camera moves backward, leading a group of men as they walk forward. A deep focus is used, keeping both the men and the background environment in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A group of men walks together. In the foreground, a tall man on the right with dark hair wears a black coat. To his right, a man in a black coat over a white collared shirt is speaking. Next to him is a man in a blue suit with a green tie and a beard. On the far left, a man with long, dark, wavy hair, wearing a dark blue blazer over a light blue shirt, holds his hand to his mouth. In the background, other men accompany the group, and a small child in a red sweater is visible among them.",
    "Motion": "A group of men walks forward in a procession along a paved path between two buildings. In the center, two men are talking as they walk; the man on the left is wearing a blue suit and initially faces the man in the center, who is wearing a black coat, before turning his head to face forward. A tall man in a black coat on the right walks steadily, while a man with medium-length hair on the left initially walks with his hand near his mouth, then lowers his hand and turns his head to look to his left. Other men and a small child follow behind the main group.",
    "Scene": "A group of men in suits and coats walks along a paved outdoor walkway situated between two long, identical, single-story buildings. The buildings feature white walls, red-tiled roofs, and are lined with large, brown, grid-like ventilation units. The scene is set during the day under an overcast sky. The camera maintains a level angle and moves backward in front of the advancing group. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays white text that reads, \"Çiftlik Bank - Mavi Yumurta Sakarya Tesisi Açılış Klibi (2017)\".",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a group of men occupies the center of the frame, walking forward along a paved walkway. In the foreground, there are four individuals: a man with medium-length hair in a dark blue blazer on the left, a man in a blue suit second from the left, a man in a black coat second from the right, and a tall man in a black coat on the far right. In the middle ground and background, additional men and a small child walk behind the main group. The scene is flanked by two long buildings on the left and right, extending from the foreground into the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves backward to track the group's advance, maintaining their central position within the frame. A text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
