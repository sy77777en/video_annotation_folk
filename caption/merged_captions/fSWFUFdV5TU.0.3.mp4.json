  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot where a woman is reclining on a dark, patterned couch positioned on the left side of the frame and in the middle ground. She wears light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and her silhouetted form primarily shows her right side as she appears to look towards the right. The couch itself occupies the left foreground to middle ground. In front of the couch, a low table is situated in the center-right foreground to middle ground, cluttered with several indistinct dark objects and some lighter-colored items, including what appears to be crumpled paper or fabric. A window, located in the center background, is partially covered by a rumpled, orange-yellow curtain, allowing a strong, diffused beam of light to penetrate the otherwise dark room, illuminating dust or smoke particles in the air and the middle ground towards the center-right. To the far right of the frame, an older model, dark-colored television set rests on a stand in the middle ground. The scene is a dimly lit, hazy interior, likely a bedroom or small apartment, viewed from an objective perspective. The overall atmosphere is somber and still. The woman reclining on the couch remains still throughout the video. The camera is static at hip level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene without any movement.",

    "Scene": "The scene is a dimly lit, hazy interior, likely a bedroom or small apartment, viewed from an objective perspective. A window in the middle of the frame is partially covered by a rumpled, orange-yellow curtain, allowing a strong, diffused beam of light to penetrate the otherwise dark room, illuminating dust or smoke particles in the air. To the left, a person is silhouetted, reclining on a bed or sofa with a patterned cover. In front of the person, a dark, cluttered table holds various indistinct items, including what appears to be crumpled paper or fabric. To the far right, a television set is visible on a stand.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
