  "merged_caption": "The video presents a serene winter forest, capturing an expansive view of the landscape. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus to maintain clarity throughout the depth of field. It moves smoothly and steadily to the left, providing a dynamic perspective. In the foreground, small shrubs and young trees are visible, covered in snow, adding depth to the scene. The lower half of the frame is predominantly occupied by the snow-covered ground, while the upper half is filled with taller, leafless trees with dark trunks. These trees stand upright and evenly spaced, their branches dusted with snow and extending horizontally and vertically. The background consists of more trees extending into the distance, where sunlight filters through, casting soft shadows and creating a warm glow near the horizon. The sun is positioned slightly off-center towards the top right, illuminating the scene from behind the trees. As the camera moves left, sunlight filters through the gaps, casting a warm glow and creating a beautiful interplay of light and shadow on the snowy ground, enhancing the serene winter landscape. The video captures a serene winter forest scene at sunrise, with the setting outdoors featuring a dense array of tall, leafless trees with dark trunks, their branches lightly dusted with snow. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of undisturbed snow, creating a uniform white landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, elongated shadows and creating a gentle glow in the background. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement, emphasizing the quiet beauty of the snowy forest. The camera's height is level with the lower sections of the trees, offering a balanced view of the forest floor and the tree canopy, maintaining a steady and tranquil depiction of the winter forest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
