  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked passenger airplane positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, slowly taxiing forward and making a gradual right turn as it follows the yellow guidance lines on the dark, curved taxiway. The airplane is a twin-engine jet, with its engines mounted in pods beneath the wings, featuring a standard tail assembly and winglets that curve upwards at the tips of the main wings. The entire exterior of the plane, including the fuselage, wings, and tail, is a uniform white color, lacking any airline livery, registration numbers, or other distinguishing marks. The taxiway extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, indistinct airport buildings are visible on the left, set against a dusky, reddish-orange sky that fills the top portion of the frame, indicating either dawn or twilight. A concrete ledge occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom edge of the shot. From an overhead, high-angle perspective, the camera tracks the white airplane, moving backward while trucking right and panning left to follow the plane's movement on the tarmac. This transitions the camera to a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, and keeping the subject's height consistent throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead, high-angle perspective, the camera tracks a white airplane. It moves backward while trucking right and panning left to follow the plane's movement on the tarmac, which transitions the camera to a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A white, unmarked passenger airplane is shown on an airport taxiway. The aircraft is a twin-engine jet, with its engines mounted in pods beneath the wings. It features a standard tail assembly and winglets that curve upwards at the tips of the main wings. The entire exterior of the plane, including the fuselage, wings, and tail, is a uniform white color, lacking any airline livery, registration numbers, or other distinguishing marks. The airplane is positioned on a dark, paved surface with yellow guidance lines, appearing to be in the process of making a turn.",
    "Motion": "A white airplane slowly taxis forward, making a gradual right turn as it follows the yellow guidance lines on the curved taxiway.",
    "Scene": "A white, unmarked passenger airplane is positioned on a dark asphalt taxiway at an airport. The scene takes place under a dusky, reddish-orange sky, indicating either dawn or twilight. Yellow lines mark the curved path on the taxiway, which the aircraft is navigating. In the blurred background, the simple, blocky silhouettes of airport structures are visible against the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked airplane positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, slowly taxiing forward and making a gradual right turn as it follows the yellow guidance lines on the dark, curved taxiway. The taxiway extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, indistinct airport buildings are visible on the left, set against a dusky sky that fills the top portion of the frame. A concrete ledge occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom edge of the shot. The camera moves backward while simultaneously trucking right and panning left to track the plane's movement, all while maintaining the subject's height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
