  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a level angle, positioned on a metal medical stretcher. An injured light-skinned man with dark hair and a beard lies on his back in the foreground, wearing a light-colored hospital gown composed of rows of regularly spaced dots and dashes, sunglasses, a white neck brace, a bandage wrapped around his forehead, and a white cast on his right arm and hand. His body extends from the lower left towards the center. Directly behind him in the middle ground, a person in a full-body, plush grey pigeon costume, featuring a large, sculpted bird head with an orange beak and large, round orange eyes, is centered, holding the stretcher. The road stretches from the foreground into the background, flanked by steep, light-colored rocky cliffs with sparse green vegetation on the left and right in the middle ground, with a tall metal gate covered in colorful graffiti also on the left. The camera captures the scene with noticeable barrel lens distortion, starting at hip level and moving up to eye level. After a brief pause, the camera pans slightly to the left. The camera employs deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and has noticeable shaking throughout the video. As the person in the pigeon costume runs up to the stretcher and begins to push it forward along the paved road, the man on the stretcher moves steadily past the stationary rocky landscape and the graffiti-covered gate. As the stretcher moves forward, the pigeon person leans in, transitioning their framing from a full shot to a medium shot, while the man in the foreground shifts to the lower left. A bright sun creates a strong lens flare in the sky, enhancing the sun-drenched atmosphere.",

The level angle captures steep, light-colored cliffs with sparse green vegetation rising on both sides of the road, and a bright sun creates a strong lens flare in the sky. On the left, a tall metal gate covered in colorful graffiti stands beside the road. A figure in a large bird costume pushes the stretcher from behind, with the legs and torso of an injured person in a hospital gown visible in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
