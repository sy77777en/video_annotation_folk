  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot focused on an ornate, circular, dark gray metal object positioned in the left foreground, featuring intricate scrollwork patterns radiating from a smaller, ribbed circle at its center. Extending from this object is a dark, complex structure that occupies the space from the foreground to the middle ground. The scene is set in a dimly lit space, characterized by dramatic, focused lighting that illuminates these specific objects while leaving the surroundings in deep shadow. Initially, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the ornate, circular object. A rack focus then shifts the plane of focus to a sepia-toned photograph with aged, torn edges, held in a stand on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. This transition brings the photograph, which shows two figures, appearing to be an adult and a child sitting together in a portrait, into sharp view. As the focus changes, the circular object in the left foreground becomes blurred, emphasizing the depth between the two elements. The objects themselves remain stationary throughout the shot. The final composition maintains the close-up framing, with the photograph as the subject in the right middle ground and the out-of-focus circular object in the left foreground, all viewed from a relatively low camera angle.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle shot. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on an ornate, circular object in the foreground. A rack focus then shifts the plane of focus to a photograph in the midground, bringing it into sharp view.",
    "Subject": "The video initially focuses on an ornate, circular, dark gray metal object, which features intricate scrollwork patterns radiating from a smaller, ribbed circle at its center. This object is part of a larger, dark structure. The focus then shifts to a rectangular, sepia-toned photograph with aged, torn edges, which is held in place on the right side of the structure. The photograph shows two figures, appearing to be an adult and a child, sitting together in a portrait.",
    "Motion": "The camera's focus shifts from an ornate, circular metal object in the foreground to a sepia-toned photograph held in a stand in the middle ground on the right. As the focus changes, the foreground object becomes blurry, and the photograph comes into sharp view. The objects themselves remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit space, an ornate, dark metal wheel with intricate scrollwork patterns occupies the left foreground. The wheel features a central hub and a ridged inner circle. Near the metal wheel is a dark, jumbled collection of metal pieces that together form an intricate structure. To the right, a small, sepia-toned photograph held in a stand comes into focus, with the stand also being part of the structure. The scene is characterized by dramatic, focused lighting that illuminates these specific objects while leaving the surroundings in deep shadow. The camera's focus shifts from the metal wheel in the foreground to the photograph in the middleground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot focused on an ornate, circular metal object positioned in the left foreground. Extending from this object is a dark, complex structure that occupies the space from the foreground to the middle ground, with a blurry, sepia-toned photograph visible in the upper right. The camera remains static as the focus shifts from the foreground object to the middle ground, a technique known as a rack focus. This transition brings the photograph, held in a stand on the right side of the frame, into sharp view. As a result, the circular object in the left foreground becomes blurred, emphasizing the depth between the two elements. The final composition maintains the close-up framing, with the photograph as the subject in the right middle ground and the out-of-focus circular object in the left foreground, all viewed from a relatively low camera angle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
