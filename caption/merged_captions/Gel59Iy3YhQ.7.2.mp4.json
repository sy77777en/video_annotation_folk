  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a small, fantastical creature with dark blue, velvety fur and large black eyes is positioned in the center-left middle ground, while a person's light-skinned hand, adorned with glowing, light-blue, vein-like markings, occupies the center-right middle ground. The creature, which has a crown-like arrangement of green leaves and small, brown, twig-like horns atop its head, is gently stroked on its belly by the person's fingers. This interaction takes place in a lush, green forest with a soft-focus background, where a reddish, textured cuff is visible on the person's wrist. The creature responds by closing its eyes and nuzzling into the touch with a content expression. The camera, maintaining a level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focuses on the creature and the hand in the midground, leaving the leafy background blurred. As the scene progresses, the camera executes a very smooth, minor upward tilt, maintaining its position at the subjects' level. The creature then opens its eyes, looks down toward the hand, and its expression changes to one of surprise upon noticing the glowing markings.",

    "Camera": "This is a level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a small blue creature and a hand in the midground, leaving the leafy background blurred. The camera executes a very smooth, minor upward tilt.",
    "Subject": "A person's light-skinned hand, which has glowing, light-blue, vein-like markings on its back, gently pets a small, fantastical creature. The creature is round, covered in dark blue, velvety fur, and has large, black, expressive eyes. Atop its head is a crown-like arrangement of green leaves and small, brown, twig-like horns. The person's fingers stroke the creature's belly, causing it to close its eyes and nuzzle into the touch with a content expression. At the end of the video, the creature looks down and appears surprised by the markings.",
    "Motion": "A hand gently strokes the belly of a small, blue creature. The creature responds by closing its eyes and nuzzling into the touch. It then opens its eyes, looks down at the hand, and its expression changes to one of surprise.",
    "Scene": "In a lush, green forest with a soft-focus background, a person's hand gently interacts with a small creature. The creature is dark blue with a soft, furry texture, large black eyes, and a crown made of green leaves and small wooden branches. The hand, which has glowing blue, vein-like patterns on its skin, is seen touching the creature's belly. A reddish, textured cuff is visible on the person's wrist.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a small, blue creature is positioned in the center-left middle ground, while a person's hand occupies the center-right middle ground. A blurred green forest serves as the background. The hand's fingers gently stroke the creature, which initially closes its eyes and leans into the touch. The creature then opens its eyes and looks down toward the hand. The camera exhibits a slight upward tilt and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
