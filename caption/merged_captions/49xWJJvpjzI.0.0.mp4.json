  "merged_caption": "In this dynamic scene, a figure in a sleek, black, full-body suit with glowing purple, vein-like patterns stands behind a rock slightly left of center in the foreground, positioned in the middle ground of a shallow, churning river at the base of rolling green hills. A second figure, a bearded man with brown hair in dark, tactical-looking attire, is located in the center-right middle ground. They are surrounded by numerous aggressive, four-legged creatures with dark, greyish-red skin and multiple limbs within the river, with some in the immediate foreground and others filling the middle ground and background against a backdrop of sandy banks, scattered rocks, and vegetation under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds. The scene erupts with motion as the character in the black and purple suit stands on a rock, emitting a purple kinetic energy blast that hurls several creatures backward into the water. Simultaneously, the bearded character fights nearby, kicking and punching other creatures, sending them flying. The camera, from an unsteady, eye-level perspective with a level angle, uses deep focus to keep the chaotic battle scene sharp, arcing clockwise around the two central figures, then rapidly panning left to keep them centered amidst the action. The movement is shaky, enhancing the intensity of the fight. As the battle continues, the two central figures are pushed slightly backward by the force of the engagement, which churns the water around them. Towards the end of the scene, the character in the black and purple suit executes a forward side flip, resulting in the two figures switching positions as they persist in their battle against the creatures. A blue, smoky energy effect emanates from the background, adding to the scene's dynamic atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "This video shows a chaotic battle scene involving two men fighting a horde of monstrous creatures in a shallow body of water. One man is clad in a sleek, black, full-body suit with glowing purple, vein-like patterns across it. The other is a man with brown hair and a beard, wearing dark, tactical-looking attire. They are surrounded by numerous aggressive, four-legged creatures with dark, greyish-red skin and multiple limbs, who are lunging and attacking them.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor battle unfolds during the daytime in a shallow, churning river at the base of rolling green hills. The landscape features sandy banks, scattered rocks, and vegetation under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds. The water is disturbed by the motion of numerous figures engaged in combat. A blue, smoky energy effect emanates from the background, while one central figure wears a dark suit with glowing purple lines.",
    "Spatial": "In this dynamic scene, a figure in a black and purple suit stands behind a rock that is slightly left of center in the foreground, positioned in the middle ground. A second figure in dark attire is located in the center-right middle ground. They are surrounded by numerous creatures within a shallow river, with some in the immediate foreground and others filling the middle ground and background against a backdrop of green hills. The scene erupts with motion as the creatures are violently thrown outward from the center; one is flung toward the top left of the frame, while others are knocked back across the middle ground. The two central figures are pushed slightly backward by the force of the engagement, which churns the water around them. At the conclusion of the scene, the character in the black-and-purple outfit executes a forward side flip, resulting in the two figures switching positions as they continue their fight. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
