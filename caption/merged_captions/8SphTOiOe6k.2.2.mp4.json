  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a traditional Japanese building. The shot begins with a large, roofed wooden signboard in the center foreground, displaying a photograph of a garden with a pond, a building, and mountains under a blue sky. A portion of the building is visible behind it in the middle and background, with a large rock in the bottom left foreground. From a smooth, eye-level, level-angle perspective with a deep focus, the camera pans left and tilts down, moving the signboard to the right side of the frame until it eventually goes out of frame. This movement reveals the building's facade, characterized by dark wood paneling, white plaster walls, and a window with vertical wooden slats. The camera then begins to truck left, revealing a wooden entrance gate with a white banner in the center-left middle ground, left of a low wooden fence. A small gravel garden with a rock initially occupies the foreground from the bottom left; as the camera pans and trucks left, the rock moves to the bottom right, while more of the building's facade is shown in the middle ground. The structure features white walls, dark wood framing, a slatted window, and a white banner hanging over a wooden gate. The video concludes by showing a wooden entrance gate, from which a white banner with black calligraphy and circular emblems is suspended. A low wooden fence is visible near the entrance. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the temple-like environment, from the sign and garden to the latticed windows and entryway.",

The camera then pans left, revealing more of the building's exterior, which features white plaster walls, dark wooden framing, and a tiled roof. This movement brings into view a small, meticulously arranged gravel garden with moss-covered rocks, a low wooden fence, and a large wooden gate. A white banner with black circular crests hangs above the gate, adding to the traditional aesthetic.

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, pans left across the exterior of a traditional Japanese building during the day. The view initially centers on a large, roofed wooden signboard that holds a color photograph of a garden with a pond, a building, and mountains under a blue sky. As the camera moves, it reveals the building's facade, characterized by dark wood paneling, white plaster walls, and a window with vertical wooden slats. In the foreground, a small area contains white gravel, moss, and several large rocks. The video concludes by showing a wooden entrance gate, from which a white banner with black calligraphy and circular emblems is suspended. A low wooden fence is visible near the entrance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
