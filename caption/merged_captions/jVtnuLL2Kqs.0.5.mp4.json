  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide-angle time-lapse shot of a London cityscape, initially moving slightly backward before panning left and then moving slightly forward. A large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground vertically divides the composition. On the left side of the frame, as the camera pans, a stone balustrade extends from the foreground to the middle ground, starting from the bottom right. Modern sculptures with multiple spiked ornaments are visible in the middle ground, and an upright frame displaying photographs is seen in the foreground against a partly cloudy sky. The scene captures noticeable movement of people in the streets. On the right side, a sidewalk begins in the foreground and recedes into the distance, adjacent to a wide road in the middle ground. A traffic light stands in the foreground on the right. Further in the middle ground on the right, the Victoria Memorial, a white marble monument topped with a gilded statue, is visible, with the grand facade of Buckingham Palace situated in the background behind it. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level, looking straight ahead, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The shot begins with a slight move backward, followed by a pan to the left, and concludes with a quick forward movement. An overlay consisting of a white logo is visible in the bottom right corner. The expansive perspective is designed to emphasize the architectural grandeur and the atmosphere of the famous location, focusing on the sense of place rather than a particular person or object.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video shot from a smooth, eye-level, and level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot begins with a slight move backward, followed by a pan to the left, and concludes with a quick forward movement.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an iconic view in London. The composition is split by a large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between two scenes. To the left, a stone balustrade with multiple spires stands against a partly cloudy sky, and next to the balustrade, there is an upright frame displaying a photograph. To the right, a sun-drenched, empty road stretches towards the majestic Buckingham Palace in the distance, with the golden-winged statue of the Victoria Memorial visible before it. There is no main subject, as the expansive perspective is designed to emphasize the architectural grandeur and the atmosphere of the famous location, focusing on the sense of place rather than a particular person or object.",
    "Motion": "This wide-angle time-lapse video captures a dynamic London street scene, with noticeable movement of people in the streets. The shot initially features a pillar on the left, which moves to the right and eventually out of the frame as the camera pans left. The scene reveals modern sculptures and a framed photograph on the left, with the iconic Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial on the right, all under a partly cloudy sky.",
    "Scene": "This daytime, outdoor scene in London is framed by a large, light-colored stone pillar and balustrade on the left. To the right, a sidewalk extends towards the Victoria Memorial, a white marble monument topped with a gilded statue, with the grand facade of Buckingham Palace visible in the background. A wide road and a traffic light on a pole occupy the right side of the view. On the left, there is a stone balustrade adorned with numerous spires standing against a partly cloudy sky, and to the left of the fence, an upright frame displaying photographs is visible. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds. An overlay consisting of a white logo is visible in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
