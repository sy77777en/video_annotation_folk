  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a silhouetted person is positioned in the center of the frame, initially suspended in the middle ground against a bright, starburst-like light source that is also centered in the background. The scene is set in deep, dark blue water, viewed from a worm's-eye perspective with the camera positioned below the subject, looking upward. The camera remains static, employing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The person, who appears to be wearing a jacket and pants, begins to slowly turn in a counter-clockwise direction, with arms outstretched in a relaxed, slightly asymmetrical pose. Their shaggy hair is visible in outline against the brilliant, starburst-like blue light source positioned directly behind them. The intense backlighting obscures all details of their features and clothing, rendering them as a dark shape against the radiant glow. As the scene progresses, the person descends to the foreground, drifting passively as if carried by a current. A few small, illuminated bubbles or particles are visible floating in the water, adding to the ethereal quality of the underwater environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, underwater shot from a worm's-eye view, looking directly up at a person floating in the water. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A silhouetted person is seen floating in deep blue water. Initially viewed from below, the figure, who appears to be wearing a jacket and pants, begins to rotate as they float with their arms outstretched in a relaxed, slightly asymmetrical pose. Their shaggy hair is visible in outline against a brilliant, starburst-like blue light source positioned directly behind them. The intense backlighting obscures all details of their features and clothing, rendering them as a dark shape against the radiant glow.",
    "Motion": "A silhouetted person, viewed from below in deep blue water, slowly turns in a counter-clockwise direction. With arms outstretched, the figure drifts passively, as if carried by a current.",
    "Scene": "From an underwater perspective looking upward, a scene is set in deep, dark blue water. A brilliant, singular light source shines down from above, casting radiant beams that create a starburst effect through the murky depths. Centered against this intense blue-white light is the dark silhouette of a fully clothed person, descending towards the water's bottom and the camera, while rotating in a counter-clockwise direction. A few small, illuminated bubbles or particles are visible floating in the water.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a silhouetted person is positioned in the center of the frame, initially suspended in the middle ground against a bright, starburst-like light source that is also centered in the background. The person gradually turns counter-clockwise in the water, maintaining an asymmetrical pose throughout. As the scene progresses, the person descends to the foreground. The scene is captured from a worm's eye view, with the camera positioned below the subject, looking upward."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
