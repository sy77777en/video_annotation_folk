  "merged_caption": "The video captures an extreme wide shot of an urban construction site, showcasing the entire scene without focusing on specific objects. The camera, featuring noticeable fisheye distortion, starts with a view of the construction site extending from the foreground into the middle ground, positioned in the bottom half of the frame. Two prominent cranes dominate the middle ground, extending upwards into the top right and center. Additional modern high-rise buildings form the background along the horizontal midline of the frame in the distance. The video begins with a view of a construction site featuring several tall buildings and cranes against a partly cloudy sky. As the drone, maintaining a smooth, aerial-level perspective, pans left, more of the construction site and the surrounding buildings come into view, with a completed section of a building visible in the left foreground. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The construction site extends from the foreground to the background in the center of the frame. As the camera continues to pan left, revealing more of the construction site and the buildings, the sky transitions from blue to a mix of orange and yellow hues, filling the top part of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the construction site, providing an aerial perspective throughout the sequence. The drone initially pans left, revealing a building on the left side of the frame, and then flies forward. The sky, initially soft blue, gradually transitions to warm sunset hues, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The spatial dynamics highlight the expansive view of the developing area and the surrounding urban landscape, emphasizing the bustling city life and ongoing development, with the construction site actively contributing to the evolving city skyline.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion and is captured from a smooth, aerial-level drone perspective. The camera maintains a level angle and uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The drone initially pans left, revealing a building on the left side of the frame, and then flies forward.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a static urban environment with a focus on the overall atmosphere and scale rather than a specific object. The scene includes multiple construction cranes towering over a developing area, surrounded by modern high-rise buildings. As the camera pans to the left, the sky transitions from a soft blue to a warm sunset hue. The emphasis is on the bustling city life and ongoing development, highlighting the expansive view and the interplay of natural and urban elements.",

    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban construction site. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling cityscape with several high-rise buildings surrounding the area. Prominent construction cranes tower over the site, where various materials and equipment are visible. As the camera pans to the left, the sky transitions from a soft blue to warm hues of orange and pink, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The buildings, primarily made of glass and steel, reflect the changing colors of the sky, adding a dynamic visual element. The overall atmosphere is one of development and transformation, with the construction site actively contributing to the evolving city skyline.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures an extreme wide shot of an urban construction site, showcasing the entire scene without focusing on specific objects. The camera starts with a view of the construction site extending from the foreground into the middle ground, positioned in the bottom half of the frame. Two prominent cranes dominate the middle ground, extending upwards into the top right and center. Additional modern high-rise buildings form the background along the horizontal midline of the frame in the distance. As the camera pans to the left, the construction site shifts slightly towards the center, and a completed building is partially visible in the left foreground. The sky, initially soft blue, gradually transitions to warm sunset hues, filling the top part of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the construction site, providing an aerial perspective throughout the sequence. The spatial dynamics highlight the expansive view of the developing area and the surrounding urban landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
