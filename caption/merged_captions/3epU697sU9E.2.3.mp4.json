  "merged_caption": "The video shows a dark, stylized map of the southeastern United States as the background. Initially, an orange circular marker for \"SARASOTA,\" with its name in orange text to its right, is visible on the Florida peninsula, positioned towards the bottom center of the map's depicted land area. The camera slowly cranes up, widening the view of the map to show the distance from Sarasota to Washington, then moves backward, gradually revealing more of the map. An orange dashed line then animates, extending northward from the Sarasota marker along the eastern coastline. This line connects to a newly appearing orange circular marker for \"WASHINGTON,\" with its name in orange text to its right, situated in the upper portion of the depicted coastal region, northeast of Sarasota. The video starts with a map showing Sarasota, Florida, marked with an orange circle. An orange dashed line extends northward from Sarasota, passing through coastal points, and connects to another orange circle labeled Washington, D.C. The video concludes with the two markers linked by the dashed line from Sarasota to Washington. The dark, textured background symbolizes land and light gray areas represent the ocean. The location markers, names, and the connecting line are all overlays on the map. State borders and major roads are faintly visible as white lines. An orange circular marker with a white outline highlights \"SARASOTA\" in Florida, with the name appearing in glowing orange capital letters to its right. A dashed orange line then animates, extending northwards along the East Coast from Sarasota to another orange circular marker labeled \"WASHINGTON\" in glowing orange capital letters. All labeled markers and the connecting line remain as overlay elements against the background map.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a dark gray map of the southeastern United States, where landmasses are a darker gray than the surrounding light gray water, and a network of thin white lines indicates routes or borders. Initially, an orange circular marker with a darker orange inner circle highlights \"SARASOTA,\" labeled in orange uppercase text to its right, located on the coast of Florida. An orange dashed line then animates, extending northward from Sarasota along the eastern seaboard. This line connects to a second, identical orange circular marker that appears, labeled \"WASHINGTON\" in orange uppercase text to its right, situated further up the coast.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
