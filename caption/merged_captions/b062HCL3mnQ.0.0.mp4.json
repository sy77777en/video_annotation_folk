  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a woman with fair skin and dark hair styled in a 1950s fashion, adorned with a pink bow, sits alone at a table in the center middle ground of a retro diner. She wears a vintage-style dress with a full, floral-patterned skirt in shades of blue and green, a light blue collar, and short sleeves. With a pensive expression, she rests her clasped hands on the white tabletop, looking slightly off-camera. She is seated in a red and white booth that occupies the center and right middle ground. In the background, a red Coca-Cola vending machine and a neon \"ROCK 'N' ROLL\" sign are positioned in the center. To the left in the background, a Coca-Cola poster and a traffic light with illuminated red, yellow, and green lenses are visible. On the right side of the background, framed black and white photographs adorn the dark, wood-paneled walls. The black and white checkered floor extends from the middle ground to the background, with a portion of another red booth occupying the entire bottom foreground. The dimly lit space is decorated with a vintage red Coca-Cola vending machine, a glowing red and white neon \"ROCK 'N' ROLL\" sign, and a Coca-Cola advertisement poster. Filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire diner scene sharp. The camera performs a slow and smooth dolly-out, moving backward from the woman sitting at the table, capturing the stillness of the scene as the woman remains completely still with her hands clasped on the tabletop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
