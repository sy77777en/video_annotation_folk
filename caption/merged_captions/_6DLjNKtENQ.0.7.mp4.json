  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot of a woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back, shown from the chest up, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. She wears a dark, patterned uniform with gold-colored insignia on the collar points and a headset with a microphone near her slightly open mouth. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on her. Initially, she faces diagonally to the right and forward, but then begins to turn her head to the right, gradually shifting her gaze upwards towards the upper right background. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness throughout the clip. Partially visible on the far left is another person in a camouflage uniform with a circular patch on the upper sleeve, positioned in the middle ground. On the right side, another individual's hand is partially visible in the background. The video is set within a dimly lit indoor environment, with low lighting creating deep shadows in the background. A subtle reflection hints at a possible screen or monitor located to the right. The framing remains static as the woman continues to turn her head, now looking more upwards and to the right.",

    "Subject": "In the video, a woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back is shown from the chest up, facing towards the right and looking slightly upwards. She wears a headset with a microphone positioned near her slightly open mouth. Her attire is a dark, patterned uniform featuring gold-colored insignia on the collar points.

    "Motion": "The woman, dressed in a dark uniform with gold insignia, is seen in a dimly lit environment. She begins to turn her head to the right, gradually shifting her gaze upwards. The background remains consistent, with another person in a camouflage uniform visible on the left and a hand on the right. The woman continues to turn her head, now looking more upwards and to the right.",
    "Scene": "The video is set within a dimly lit indoor environment, with low lighting creating deep shadows in the background. A woman wearing a dark, patterned uniform adorned with insignia and a black headset is positioned facing slightly towards the right, aligning with the right side of the background. Partially visible behind her is another individual in dark attire, and on the far left, a segment of another uniform featuring a patch can be seen. The surrounding area is mostly obscured by darkness, with a subtle reflection hinting at a possible screen or monitor located to the right.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up shot. The main subject, a woman, is positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. She initially faces diagonally to the right and forward, but then turns her head to look towards the upper right background. Partially visible on the far left is another person in the middle ground. On the right side, another person's hand is partially visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The framing remains static throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
