  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, a full shot shows a group of approximately ten young men, mostly with dark complexions, gathered on an elevated concrete walkway outdoors, positioned on an elevated walkway that extends across the lower half of the frame. The setting is under a flat, grey, overcast sky. A central figure stands behind a black metal railing in the center, looking down; he is dressed in a black and white patterned jacket and matching pants. The rest of the group stands behind the railing to the left and right, mostly clad in dark hooded jackets and sweatshirts, with some making hand gestures. To the central figure's left, a man in a black hooded jacket makes hand gestures, while to his right, another man is partially seen wearing a brown hooded garment. One man on the left wears a bright blue hooded jacket and patterned light blue jeans. In the foreground, a concrete structure occupies the bottom of the frame, with a small white sign with black capital letters that reads \"NO BALL GAMES\" positioned at the bottom center. The railing is in the middle ground, situated just above the sign and in front of the men. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left foreground, set against the overcast sky that serves as the background in the upper portion of the frame. The subjects in the video are nodding their heads and making hand gestures. This is a static, low-angle shot that looks up at the group of people on the balcony. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. To the left, the dark, bare branches of a tree and the side of a building are visible against the sky.",

The setting is under a flat, grey, overcast sky. A small white sign with black lettering that reads \"NO BALL GAMES\" is attached to the front of the concrete structure.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
