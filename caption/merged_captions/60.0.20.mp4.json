  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, with the main subject, a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, positioned centrally in the foreground. She wears a blue, long-sleeved athletic top with a white Nike swoosh on the right chest and small hoop earrings. Her left hand is raised near her forehead as she turns her head slightly from her left towards her right while her mouth moves as if speaking. The camera is positioned at hip level, employing a low angle to look up at the subjects, and uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in the foreground in focus. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movement as it zooms in on her. In the middle ground behind her, two individuals are positioned on the bottom left, and one is on the bottom right. The woman on the left has dark hair pulled back, wears a pink t-shirt, and has a blue garment draped over her left shoulder. Next to her, another woman with dark hair pulled back wears a pink t-shirt featuring a black Nike swoosh on the right side of her chest. A third individual is partially visible on the far right, wearing a red and black patterned top. All background individuals appear to be looking in a similar direction as the main subject and remain mostly still. A white-painted brick wall forms the background across the frame. The scene is set indoors, in a moderately lit room.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a moderately lit room with a white-painted brick wall in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
