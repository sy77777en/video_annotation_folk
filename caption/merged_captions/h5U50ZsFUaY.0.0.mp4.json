  "merged_caption": "Initially, the paraglider is positioned in the foreground, while the lower half of the frame in the middle ground features red rock cliffs, and the upper frame in the background shows a clear blue sky. A man is paragliding, suspended in a harness beneath a large, white and blue canopy. He is wearing a light green long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a blue helmet. The camera, positioned below the subject, shifts to the subject's height as it moves closer. As the camera pans to the right, the paraglider gradually moves from the foreground to the middle ground. The plain at the bottom extends from the foreground to the background, and the red rock cliffs on both sides extend from the middle ground to the background. A video filmed by a drone captures a paraglider soaring over a vast canyon. The outdoor setting is an expansive, arid landscape characterized by steep, reddish-brown rock cliffs under a clear, deep blue sky. The sun is low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the rugged terrain and creating a bright lens flare. At the bottom of the deep canyon, a winding body of water is visible. The paraglider, featuring a white and blue canopy, glides along the edge of the cliff face. The camera smoothly pans right to track the person's movement. During the pan, the camera tilts slightly downward and rolls counterclockwise, creating a dynamic Dutch angle effect before transitioning the view to a level angle. As the camera pans right to follow this movement, the sun appears in the background, and the canyon floor, featuring a body of water, becomes visible at the bottom of the frame. The shot concludes with the paraglider in the top center middle ground, silhouetted above the canyon edge.",

    "Camera": "This aerial-level shot begins at a low angle, looking up at a person paragliding. The camera smoothly pans right to track the person's movement. During the pan, the camera tilts slightly downward and rolls counterclockwise, creating a dynamic Dutch angle effect before transitioning the view to a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the paraglider and the vast canyon landscape in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A man is paragliding, suspended in a harness beneath a large, white and blue canopy. He is wearing a light green long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a blue helmet. Initially, he holds onto the control handles, but then releases them, causing him to descend.",
    "Motion": "A person paraglides along the edge of a red rock canyon, holding the control handles. They then release the controls, raise their arms, and fly forward and downward over the canyon. The camera pans right to follow them as they glide through the sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a paraglider soaring over a vast canyon.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
