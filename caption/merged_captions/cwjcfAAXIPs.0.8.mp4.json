  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide, slightly high-angle view of a foggy harbor along the Douro River in Porto. A stone quay occupies the foreground at the bottom and left of the frame. In the middle ground, several traditional Rabelo boats with dark hulls, red and white cabins, and distinctive yellow rudders are moored from the center to the right, with a small, simple blue boat initially positioned just left of the center. On the left, multiple multi-story buildings with numerous windows line the street along the edge of the harbor. In the distant background, the silhouettes of a bridge and another large building are centered and obscured by thick, grey fog. The camera, captured from a slightly unsteady, first-person perspective at eye-level with mild barrel distortion, moves forward until it stops at the shoreline. A pair of light-skinned hands holding a black digital camera then enters from the bottom of the frame, rising to occupy the bottom-center foreground. The hands lift the camera up to eye level, positioning it to capture a photograph of the moored boats. The camera tilts up and pans smoothly from left to right to frame the foggy harbor, with the small blue boat shifting to the left middle ground of the frame. The camera's rear screen becomes visible, showing a live view of the boats on the calm, dark water. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp from the foreground to the distant background. The hands hold the camera steady for the remainder of the shot, framing the scene against the misty backdrop.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a slightly unsteady, first-person perspective at eye-level, with mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera moves forward until it stops at the shoreline. It then follows the photographer's actions, tilting up and panning smoothly from left to right to frame the foggy harbor. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp from the foreground to the distant background.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, the video opens on a foggy harbor scene. Several traditional wooden boats with dark hulls, yellow prows, and red markings, some bearing the name \"CRUZ,\" are moored at a pier next to a small, simple blue boat. On the left, old, multi-story buildings line the stone quay. In the distance, the silhouettes of a bridge and another large building are barely discernible through the thick, grey fog. A pair of light-skinned hands enters the view, holding a black digital camera and raising it to frame a photograph of the misty scene. The camera's rear screen is visible, showing a live view of the boats on the calm water.",
    "Motion": "Following a static opening shot of a foggy harbor, a pair of hands holding a black digital camera rises from the bottom of the frame. The hands lift the camera up to eye level, positioning it to capture a photograph of the moored boats. The camera is then held steady for the remainder of the shot.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a foggy morning along the Douro River in Porto. Thick white fog blankets the scene, partially obscuring a distant bridge and buildings on the far bank. Several traditional Rabelo boats with dark hulls, red and white cabins, and distinctive yellow rudders are moored at a stone quay next to the calm, dark water. A small, simple blue boat is also moored to the quay. On the left, multiple multi-story buildings with numerous windows line the street along the edge of the harbor. A pair of hands raises a black camera into the view, framing a photograph of the boats against the misty backdrop.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide, slightly high-angle view of a foggy harbor. A stone quay occupies the foreground at the bottom and left of the frame. In the middle ground, several large boats are moored from the center to the right, with a small blue boat initially positioned just left of the center. As the camera pans to the right, the small blue boat shifts to the left middle ground of the frame. A row of buildings lines the quay in the middle ground on the left. In the distant background, the silhouettes of a bridge and a building are centered and obscured by fog. A pair of hands holding a black camera then enters from the bottom of the frame, rising to occupy the bottom-center foreground. The hands lift the camera, framing the scene, with the camera's rear screen becoming visible as it partially obscures the boats."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
