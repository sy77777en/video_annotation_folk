  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a bustling urban street, capturing the vibrant cityscape. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective as if walking along the sidewalk. The forward-moving camera at eye level with a level angle maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the frame. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking as it progresses along the street. In the initial scene, the tiled sidewalk with a yellow tactile path runs through the center, guiding the viewer's eye from the foreground to the background, where people walk past shops on the left and a bus or subway station with a metallic roof on the right. The buildings with large windows and colorful signage form the background, framing the scene vertically. The video captures a bustling urban street scene with people walking along a sidewalk and crossing a street. The area is lined with shops and buildings, and there are visible signs and advertisements. The atmosphere is lively and typical of a city environment. As the video transitions, the camera moves forward towards a busy crosswalk, maintaining the wide shot. The crosswalk spans both the bottom and middle of the frame, with pedestrians moving through it, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals in the background. The camera remains at the height of the pedestrians, emphasizing the dynamic movement and scale of the urban environment. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic ambiance of city life, rather than any specific individual or object, highlighting the scale and activity of the urban setting. The setting is outdoors in a city environment, likely during the day, given the bright natural light illuminating the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
