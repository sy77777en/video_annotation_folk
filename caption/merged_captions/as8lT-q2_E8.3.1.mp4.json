  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a high-angle perspective, looking down through a red metal structure that acts as a foreground frame. Initially, a light-skinned man with short, dark hair, wearing a light grey, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, is visible in a medium shot, positioned slightly to the center-left of the frame, clinging to the structure. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the man in the foreground and the illuminated city streets far below him sharp and in view. In the background, far below, a city street is visible in the center, with the red and white lights of traffic flowing between tall skyscrapers. The buildings' windows are illuminated, creating grids of light against the dark architecture. To the right, a modern building with a facade of brightly lit square windows stands next to a dark object hanging from a chain. The man then slips from his initial position, dropping downwards within the central frame. As he falls a short distance, the video effectively transitions to a full shot, capturing his entire body dangling by his arms. He remains slightly to the center-left of the frame, looking up toward the camera, which is positioned above him, maintaining a strong visual focus. His full body is now dangling as he looks up toward the camera with a strained expression.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, overhead perspective, the camera looks down at a man hanging from a structure high above a city at night. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. A deep focus keeps both the man in the foreground and the illuminated city streets far below him sharp and in view.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with short, dark hair is seen from a high-angle, downward-looking perspective through a red metal structure. He is wearing a light grey, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. Initially, he is clinging to the structure, with only his torso and one leg visible. He then slips and is left hanging by only his arms, his full body now dangling as he looks up toward the camera with a strained expression.",
    "Motion": "A man, seen from above through a red metal structure, slips from his initial position. He falls a short distance and is left dangling by only his arms, his body hanging in the air as he looks up.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point at night, the scene looks straight down through the red, triangular metal beams of a large structure. Far below, a city street is visible, with the red and white lights of traffic flowing between tall skyscrapers. The buildings' windows are illuminated, creating grids of light against the dark architecture. To the right, a modern building with a facade of brightly lit square windows stands next to a dark object hanging from a chain. A man in light-colored clothing is hanging on the red metal framework that frames the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
