  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide, low-angle scenery shot is captured from a static position on the ground, looking up. In the foreground, snow-covered ground occupies the bottom of the frame. The image is framed by a tall coniferous tree on the left and a tree with bare branches reaching skyward on the right. A forest of silhouetted evergreen trees extends into the distance, gradually diminishing in size, and seamlessly merges into the background. The aurora borealis dominates the top and center of the frame, filling the sky with swirling green light. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video captured from a static, eye-level camera. The shot is framed from a low angle, looking up at the aurora in the sky. A deep focus is used, keeping both the trees extending from the foreground to the background and the sky sharp. The video captures the dynamic display of the northern lights, with vibrant green lights swirling and shifting in wide, curtain-like bands across the dark sky, some areas glowing a brighter white. The night sky is dominated by a spectacular display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant, swirling curtains of vibrant green light stretching across the expanse. Silhouetted against this celestial phenomenon are the dark spires of numerous evergreen trees and the bare branches of a deciduous tree, their forms adding depth and scale to the scene. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of the natural environment, creating an atmosphere of awe and wonder. A few stars are visible through the moving curtains of light, enhancing the celestial ambiance.",

    "Motion": "This is a low-angle shot of the vibrant green Aurora Borealis in the night sky. The view is framed by the silhouettes of tall evergreen and bare trees in a snowy, forested landscape. The video captures the dynamic display of the northern lights.",
    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective on snow-covered ground, the view looks up at a night sky dominated by the aurora borealis. Vibrant green lights swirl and shift in wide, curtain-like bands across the dark sky, with some areas glowing a brighter white. A forest of snow-dusted coniferous trees, along with a few bare deciduous trees, are silhouetted against the luminous display. A few stars are visible through the moving curtains of light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
