  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene outdoor landscape during sunset, capturing the expansive view with a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level. The scene begins with a view of a sunset sky, where the sun is partially visible on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the environment. The sky, filled with soft, warm hues of orange and yellow, dominates the upper portion of the frame, with scattered clouds partially obscuring the sun as it sets slightly off-center to the left. The camera steadily advances along a path that runs parallel to a railway track, which remains centrally positioned, extending from the foreground into the background and converging towards the horizon. On the left side of the frame, two trees with sparse foliage are positioned in the middle ground; one is further left and closer to the camera, while the other is nearer to the center and further from the camera. Brick buildings with simple, angular shapes and dark roofs extend from the foreground to the middle ground on the right side, appearing as dark silhouettes against the bright sky. The camera maintains a level angle and a steady pace, providing a clear view over the railway track and the surrounding structures, emphasizing the tranquil and serene atmosphere. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene clearly without any lens distortion. The height of the camera is consistent with the buildings and higher than the railway track. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video; the elements maintain their initial positions and proportions. The text \"[8]\" is consistently visible in the lower left corner, adding a subtle detail to the composition.",

    "Camera": "The video features a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the entire scene clearly without any lens distortion. The camera steadily advances along the road, encompassing the landscape while highlighting the sunset in the distance.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the expansive view of the sunset, sky, and surrounding buildings. The emphasis is on the overall mood and scale of the scene rather than a specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a sunset sky, with the sun partially visible on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera moves forward along a path that runs parallel to a railway track, with buildings on both sides of the path. The buildings are dark silhouettes against the bright sky, and there are trees visible in the background. The camera maintains a steady pace, and the railway track remains in the center of the frame. There is no subject motion in the video, emphasizing the tranquil and serene atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting at sunset, showcasing a quiet rural scene with a road and railway track running parallel. The environment features a few brick buildings with simple, angular shapes and dark roofs, positioned on either side of the road. The sky is filled with soft, warm hues of orange and yellow, with scattered clouds partially obscuring the sun as it sets on the horizon. Trees with sparse foliage are visible, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. There is added text in the lower left corner that shows \"[8]\".",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene outdoor landscape during sunset. The camera continuously moves forward, capturing the expansive view. The railway track runs centrally through the scene, extending from the foreground into the background and converging towards the horizon. On the left side of the frame, two trees are positioned in the middle ground; one is further left and closer to the camera, while the other is nearer to the center and further from the camera. Brick buildings with dark roofs extend from the foreground to the middle ground on the right side. The sky, filled with warm hues of orange and yellow, dominates the upper portion of the frame, forming the background. The sun is near the horizon, slightly off-center to the left. The camera's height is consistent with the buildings and higher than the railway track, providing a clear view over the railway track and the surrounding structures. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video; the elements maintain their initial positions and proportions. The text \"[8]\" is consistently visible in the lower left corner."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
