  "merged_caption": "This low-angle full shot begins with a woman with tanned skin and long, light brown hair left loose, wearing a dark-colored bikini top and light-colored bikini bottoms, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a red surfboard that occupies both the foreground and the middle ground. She stands with her knees bent and arms held out to her sides for balance on the board, which has a wet, textured surface and a black logo resembling two stylized wings near her bare feet. A large green-blue wave is visible on the left side of the frame, originating in the middle ground and extending all the way into the foreground, while the bright blue sky and a distant landmass form the background. As the board glides across the water, spray from the wave splashes up around her feet and over the front of the board, partially obscuring the view. The locked-on shot is captured by a camera mounted on the front of the surfboard, creating a low-angle perspective from just above the water. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle as the camera rolls and shakes slightly with the board's motion. The camera tracks the board, moving backward as it advances on the wave. As the surfer walks toward the lens, the camera pans left to maintain its alignment, leading her from the front and causing her to grow larger in the frame. The shot transitions into a low-angle close-up, focusing on the woman's legs and feet, which now fill the center of the frame in the foreground as water splashes around them. A deep focus keeps the surfer and the surrounding wave in sharp detail.",

    "Subject": "A woman with tanned skin and long, light brown hair left loose is surfing on a wave. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini top and light-colored bikini bottoms. She stands with her knees bent and arms held out to her sides for balance on a red surfboard. The camera is positioned on the nose of the board, providing a low-angle view looking up at her. A black logo, resembling two stylized wings, is visible on the textured surface of the board near her bare feet as water splashes around her.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a red surfboard, riding a wave with her knees bent and arms held out for balance. As the board glides across the water, spray from the wave splashes up around her feet and over the front of the board. She maintains her stance while moving forward along the face of the wave.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the front of a red surfboard captures a ride on the ocean under a bright blue sky. The board, which has a wet, textured surface and a black logo, glides across the water as a green-blue wave curls nearby. Water splashes up from the board's movement, partially obscuring the view. In the distance, a landmass is visible on the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "This low-angle full shot begins with a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a red surfboard that occupies both the foreground and the middle ground. A large wave is visible on the left side of the frame, originating in the middle ground and extending all the way into the foreground, while the sky and a distant landmass form the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
