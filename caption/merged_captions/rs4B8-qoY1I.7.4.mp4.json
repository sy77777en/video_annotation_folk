  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from an isometric perspective, showing a male warrior character clad in a red and silver top, a helmet, and black pants while wielding a sword. Initially, the warrior stands surrounded by several humanoid skeletons, some intact and others reduced to piles of bones on the stone floor. The scene is enclosed by grey stone walls with arched openings, supportive pillars, and a cobblestone floor. A user interface overlay is fixed at the bottom center of the screen, featuring a red orb on the left, a blue orb on the right, and a central bar with various icons and buttons. The camera provides a smooth, 2.5D aerial view, trucking left with subtle vertical adjustments to effectively track the player character as they navigate the dark, stone dungeon environment. The warrior swings a sword, defeating a group of skeletons that collapse into piles of bones, joining existing bloodstains. The warrior then walks forward, approaches another skeleton near a chest, and defeats it with a sword swing. After the skeleton collapses, the warrior moves to the chest, interacts with it, and then walks away. As the camera follows the warrior moving towards the top left of the frame, this movement reveals a stone sarcophagus and a set of circular stone stairs leading up and out of view, with a small fire burning in a brazier nearby. Text briefly appears in the lower center, identifying an enemy and a kill count. The character's movement brings them closer to the sarcophagus, maintaining the dynamic flow of the scene.",

    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video shows a scene within a dark, stone dungeon. The environment is constructed from grey stone, featuring walls with arched openings, supportive pillars, and a cobblestone floor. In the upper left, a set of circular stone stairs leads up and out of view, and a small fire burns in a brazier. Throughout the scene, a character defeats several skeletons, which crumble into piles of bones on the floor, joining existing bloodstains. A stone sarcophagus is also visible within the room. An overlay at the bottom of the screen serves as a heads-up display, featuring a red orb on the left, a blue orb on the right, and a central bar with various icons and buttons. Text briefly appears in the lower center, identifying an enemy and a kill count.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from an isometric perspective. Initially, a warrior character stands surrounded by several humanoid skeletons. The scene is enclosed by stone walls and pillars. A user interface overlay is fixed at the bottom center of the screen. After the skeletons are defeated and become piles of bones on the floor, the camera follows the warrior as they move towards the top left of the frame. This movement reveals a stone sarcophagus, bringing the character closer to it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
