  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning a white man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and white shirt, hanging from the minute hand of a large, round clock in the top-center of the frame and in the middle ground. A brick building facade occupies the left foreground, while a bustling city street filled with early 20th-century automobiles and pedestrians is visible in the background, stretching from the center to the right. The camera is initially at the subject's level, captured by a vintage film camera. The camera then smoothly pulls back and moves upward, with a subtle pan to the left and a slight tilt downward, transitioning the perspective to a high-angle view. This movement reveals that the building facade is a partial set constructed on the rooftop of another building. In this final framing, the man and the building facade set are in the center-right middle ground. A vintage camera on a tripod appears in the center middle ground, with a mattress positioned in the middle ground directly below the man, all situated on a rooftop that occupies the bottom half of the frame. The distant, busy street below creates a forced-perspective illusion of great height. Although the shot initially maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear, a blurring effect is introduced as the camera pulls back, affecting the clarity of the image and creating a dreamlike quality. The video then pauses and transitions to a 3D animation that reveals the behind-the-scenes aspects of the film, further emphasizing the forced perspective and the safety measures in place for the stunt.",

    "Camera": "This aerial-level shot begins with a level angle on a man hanging from a clock on a building facade. The camera then smoothly pulls back and moves upward, with a subtle pan to the left and a slight tilt down. This movement transitions the perspective to a high-angle view, revealing that the scene is being filmed on a set constructed on a rooftop. Although the shot initially maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear, a blurring effect is introduced as the camera pulls back, affecting the clarity of the image and creating a dreamlike quality.",
    "Subject": "A white man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and white shirt, hangs from the minute hand of a large, round clock face protruding from the side of a brick building. The scene initially appears to be set high above a bustling city street filled with early-model cars and pedestrians. The perspective then changes to reveal that the building facade is a partial set constructed on the rooftop of another building. A mattress is placed on the roof floor beneath the man, and a vintage film camera on a tripod is visible, positioned to film the stunt, creating a forced perspective that makes the man appear to be at a much greater height.",
    "Motion": "The scene opens on a man dangling from the hand of a large clock on a building facade. The camera then pulls back, revealing that the building is a partial set constructed on a rooftop. The camera continues to move backward, showing a mattress on the roof below the man and the film camera used to create the illusion of great height.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with footage captured by a vintage camera, showing a man in a suit dangling from the hands of a large, round clock mounted on a brick building facade, high above a bustling street filled with early 20th-century automobiles and pedestrians. The video then pauses and transitions to a 3D animation that reveals the behind-the-scenes aspects of the film. The animation shows that the brick wall is a partial set constructed on the roof of a lower building. On the rooftop set, a vintage film camera on a tripod is positioned to film the stunt, and a mattress is placed on the floor for safety. The distant, busy street below creates a forced-perspective illusion of great height.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning a man hanging from a clock in the top-center of the frame and in the middle ground. A brick building facade occupies the left foreground, while a city street is visible in the background, stretching from the center to the right. The camera is initially at the subject's level. The camera smoothly pulls back and moves upward, with a subtle pan to the left and a slight tilt downward, revealing the scene from a high angle and shifting to an extreme wide shot. In this final framing, the man and the building facade set are in the center-right middle ground. A vintage camera on a tripod appears in the center middle ground, with a mattress positioned in the middle ground directly below the man, all situated on a rooftop that occupies the bottom half of the frame. The city street remains in the distant background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
