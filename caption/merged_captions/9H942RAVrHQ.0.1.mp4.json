  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of a black-and-white, hand-drawn, fox-like creature within a white space defined by a gray grid floor. The scene opens with the creature, curled into a circular ball, positioned in the center of the frame and floating. Initially depicted as a spinning ball in the air, the creature unfurls, revealing a slender body, a long, bushy tail, pointed ears, and black paws. It holds two small oval blades connected to a long, thin stick, resembling a helicopter rotor in function. As it unfurls, small, sketched, bubble-like shapes briefly appear and then vanish, drifting toward the bottom right. The creature begins to fall but uses the spinning rotor-like object to propel itself upwards and across the screen from left to right. It moves diagonally up and to the left while holding the rotor-like object, leaving a trail of bubble-like shapes. The creature then descends diagonally back toward the center, landing on the grid. The rotor gradually comes to a stop beside it. Finally, the creature stands up on its two hind legs. The camera remains static throughout, capturing the action above the floor, with the camera height difficult to identify against the simple grid background.",

    "Scene": "This black-and-white, hand-drawn animation is set within a stark white, undefined space. The only feature of the environment is a light gray perspective grid that establishes a floor plane. A stylized, fox-like creature, initially curled into a circular shape, unfurls and moves through the air while holding a rotor-like object. As it unfolds, a trail of small, sketched, bubble-like shapes appears and disappears as it lands on the gridded surface.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
