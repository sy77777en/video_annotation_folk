  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the camera begins at the subjects' level, positioned behind a central foreground figure, offering a perspective from within the crowd. The abstract, monochromatic human figures, uniformly colored in a light shade resembling sculptures or mannequins, are distributed across the scene. Some are in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, a large cluster fills the middle ground from left to right, and more figures stand behind barriers in the background. Several figures in the middle ground are positioned with equipment resembling cameras on tripods, suggesting a scene of observation or documentation. The figures are motionless, creating a sense of uniformity and anonymity among the subjects. The environment is an outdoor setting with the figures positioned on a dark surface, possibly asphalt, contrasting with their pale color. The background is dark, with minimal architectural elements visible, creating a stark and focused atmosphere. The camera smoothly lifts up, tilts down, and pans left to capture the crowd, transitioning from an initial eye-level perspective to an overhead view, moving from the subjects' height to a position above them. It maintains a high angle, looking down from above, and employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The scene is static, with no visible weather conditions or time of day indicated, and the overall composition conveys a sense of a gathering or event, with no single figure standing out as the focal point. The camera movement is smooth, with no shaking, enhancing the sense of an organized event or gathering.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at eye level and transitions to an overhead level. It maintains a high angle, looking down from above. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. It smoothly lifts up, tilts down, and pans left to capture the crowd, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of abstract, monochromatic human figures, all uniformly colored in a light shade, resembling sculptures or mannequins. These figures are positioned in various poses, some standing and others appearing to interact with each other. Among them, a few are engaged with equipment resembling cameras on tripods, suggesting a scene of observation or documentation. The figures are distributed across the scene, creating a sense of a gathering or event, with no single figure standing out as the focal point. The overall composition conveys a sense of uniformity and anonymity among the subjects.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a group of white, polygonal figures, likely representing people, standing around cameras on tripods. The figures are arranged in an open area with some barriers in the background. The camera smoothly lifts up, tilts down, and pans left to capture the crowd. The figures are motionless.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting with a crowd of abstract, monochromatic figures gathered in an open area. The figures are uniformly white and lack detailed features, giving them a sculptural appearance. They are positioned on a dark surface, possibly asphalt, which contrasts with their pale color. The environment is defined by a series of barriers and a camera on a tripod, suggesting an organized event or gathering. The background is dark, with minimal architectural elements visible, creating a stark and focused atmosphere. The scene is static, with no visible weather conditions or time of day indicated.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, the camera begins at the subjects' level, positioned behind a central foreground figure, offering a perspective from within the crowd. The abstract figures are distributed across the scene, with some in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, a large cluster filling the middle ground from left to right, and more figures standing behind barriers in the background. Several figures in the middle ground are positioned with cameras on tripods. The camera smoothly lifts up, tilts down, and pans left to capture the crowd, transitioning from an initial eye-level perspective to an overhead view, moving from the subjects' height to a position above them."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
