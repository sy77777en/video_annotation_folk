  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot featuring a man with a light skin tone, wearing a white T-shirt, dark pants, and sneakers, on the left side of the frame, near a picnic table and skateboard, with a fenced skate park in the background. The man, who has short hair, is in the middle ground, while the fence and trees are in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level, providing a level view and using deep focus with a large depth of field. Initially, the camera tracks the man, slightly panning right with a moderate zoom-out. The man crouches down and places his hands under the long park picnic table. He stands up and runs forward slightly, flipping the table onto the ground. The shot remains wide, with the man, table, and skateboard all in the middle ground. It appears he is venting his emotions as he raises his fists and shouts. The camera then continuously pans left and zooms in to bring him into closer focus. After overturning the table, the man begins walking away towards the left rear. At this point, the camera zooms in and transitions to a full shot, with the man positioned in the center foreground. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The man turns to his left and walks away from the camera with his back turned. Midway, he raises his right hand before lowering it again. The environment is monochromatic, giving it a classic, timeless feel. The setting is calm, with no visible movement, and the focus is on the structural elements like the fence and benches, which are made of metal and wood. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, with a clear view of the park's layout and features.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with a light skin tone, wearing a white T-shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. He has short hair and is seen near a skateboard in a park setting. The man is positioned around a picnic table, and his actions suggest he is preparing to flip the table rather than engage with the skateboard.",
    "Motion": "The man crouches down and places his hands under the long park picnic table. He stands up and runs forward slightly, flipping the table onto the ground. It appears he is venting his emotions as he raises his fists and shouts. Afterward, he turns to his left and walks away from the camera with his back turned. Midway, he raises his right hand before lowering it again.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an outdoor skate park during the day, featuring a fenced area with metal bars and benches. The ground is paved, and there are trees providing some shade. A skateboard is visible on the ground near a picnic table, suggesting activity related to skating. The environment is monochromatic, giving it a classic, timeless feel. The setting is calm, with no visible movement, and the focus is on the structural elements like the fence and benches, which are made of metal and wood. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, with a clear view of the park's layout and features.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a wide shot featuring a man in a white T-shirt and dark pants on the left side of the frame, near a picnic table and skateboard, with a fenced skate park in the background. The man is in the middle ground, while the fence and trees are in the background. The camera is at the subject's height, providing a level view. As the video progresses, the man overturns the table, and the shot remains wide, with the man, table, and skateboard all in the middle ground. After overturning the table, the man begins walking away towards the left rear. At this point, the camera zooms in and transitions to a full shot, with the man positioned in the center foreground. The camera maintains its height relative to the subject throughout, emphasizing the man's actions and interactions with the table."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
