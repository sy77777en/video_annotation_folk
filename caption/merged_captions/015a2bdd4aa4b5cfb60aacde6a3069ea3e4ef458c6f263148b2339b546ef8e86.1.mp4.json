  "merged_caption": "This video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a coastal landscape. A rocky peninsula covered in green vegetation extends from the right edge towards the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. On the left tip of this peninsula, a small building with a light-colored roof is visible in the center-left of the frame, also in the middle ground. The deep blue ocean dominates the scene, filling the left, bottom, and top-left portions of the frame, extending from the middle ground around the peninsula (where the water appears clearer and turquoise) into the background. The distant coastline and hills occupy the background along the top edge. A few small boats can be seen in the background on the water near the top of the frame. The camera is positioned above the peninsula, looking down on the landscape. The video, captured from a drone POV, features an aerial-level camera with a high angle, employing deep focus to maintain clarity across the scene. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the island, providing a comprehensive view of the terrain and surrounding water. As the camera moves, it offers various perspectives of the house perched on the rocky cliff and the surrounding landscape, including the distant mountains and several boats scattered across the sea. The expansive view highlights the natural beauty and isolation of the setting, with the rugged coastline, steep cliffs, and a backdrop of distant hills under a clear sky, suggesting a calm, sunny day. The focus is on the natural environment, showcasing the expansive view of the coastline, ocean, and surrounding land, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience. The solitary, modest building blends naturally with the environment, adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, showcasing the expansive view of the coastline, ocean, and surrounding land. The emphasis is on the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a specific object, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience.",
    "Motion": "The video showcases a small island with a house perched on a rocky cliff, surrounded by clear blue waters. The camera performs a counterclockwise arc movement centered around the island, offering various perspectives of the house and the surrounding landscape. In the background, distant mountains and several boats scattered across the sea can be seen.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a scenic coastal landscape. It features a small, rocky peninsula jutting into a deep blue sea, surrounded by clear waters with visible underwater formations. The peninsula is covered with lush green vegetation and houses a solitary, modest building with a light-colored roof, blending naturally with the environment. The coastline is rugged, with steep cliffs and a backdrop of distant hills under a clear sky, suggesting a calm, sunny day. The expansive view highlights the natural beauty and isolation of the setting, with a few boats dotting the farther ocean surface, adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
