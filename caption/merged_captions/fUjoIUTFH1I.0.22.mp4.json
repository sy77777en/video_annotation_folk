  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static, wide shot of a city street, likely in New Orleans, captured from an eye-level perspective on a foggy, overcast day. The focus is on the overall scenery rather than a specific subject. The composition is framed with a tall, black wrought-iron fence and trees, including a palm tree, in the left foreground and middle ground, while a wet, grey stone sidewalk extends from the bottom left. The right side of the frame is occupied by parked vehicles, including a prominent white Penske rental truck and another box truck, in the middle ground. To the right of the vehicles, a row of colorful two and three-story buildings with ornate balconies lines the street in the right middle ground and background, with a modern skyscraper partially obscured by fog visible in the distant center background. Although the shot is static, a few pedestrians are seen in the left middle ground, walking towards the camera along the damp sidewalk, adding a sense of scale and life to the scene. The camera is fixed, slightly unsteady, and filmed from an eye-level, level perspective, using a deep focus to keep the entire street scene, from the pedestrians on the sidewalk to the buildings in the background, in sharp detail. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the overall environment to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a moody cityscape scenery shot of a street in New Orleans on an overcast day. The perspective is from a wide, wet stone sidewalk bordered on the left by a tall, black wrought-iron fence and lush trees, including a palm tree. On the right, the street is lined with parked vehicles, most notably a large white Penske rental truck, and features a row of classic, colorful buildings with ornate balconies. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the overall environment to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm. The few pedestrians walking along the sidewalk serve only to add a sense of scale and life to the scene rather than acting as a focal point.",
    "Motion": "This is a static, wide shot of a street, likely in New Orleans, on a foggy, overcast day. The stone sidewalk is wet, and colorful buildings with balconies line the right side of the street, where a large Penske rental truck and other vehicles are parked. A few pedestrians are strolling along the sidewalk next to a tall, black metal fence.",
    "Scene": "A view down a city street on an overcast day shows a wet, grey stone sidewalk on the left, bordered by a tall, black wrought-iron fence. Behind the fence, a palm tree and other leafy trees are visible. The street on the right is lined with parked vehicles, including a prominent white Penske rental truck and another box truck. Colorful two and three-story buildings with balconies line the opposite side of the street. In the distant background, a modern skyscraper is partially obscured by fog. A few pedestrians walk along the damp sidewalk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
