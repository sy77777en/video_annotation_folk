  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially positions the main football player with dark skin, wearing a black helmet with a light yellowish-white logo, a yellow jersey with black accents and a number, black pants, and white shoes, slightly to the left of center in the midground, running towards the camera while carrying a deep red football. As he runs forward across the green grass field marked with white lines, a large cloud of brown dust and debris erupts upwards from the field directly behind him, expanding laterally and rapidly towards the players and the camera. The camera, at eye level with a deep focus, pans slightly to the left to follow the player, then moves backward, leading him from the front and keeping him centered in the frame as he becomes larger, with some shaking. To the left and behind the main player, another player in a blue and white uniform, initially kneeling on the grass, begins to rise after falling and starts running forward, following the main player. Additional players in blue and white uniforms are seen in the left foreground and across the middle ground, while more distant players from both teams, including those in yellow and black uniforms, are visible moving on the field. Stadium stands populated with spectators occupy the background on both the left and right sides, with the lower stands densely packed and the upper deck showing yellow seating due to fewer occupants. Many spectators hold yellow signs or banners, complementing the yellow facade of the upper deck. As the main player advances, he moves towards the center foreground, while the dust clouds continue to grow and spread across the middle ground behind him, under a bright, overcast sky.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. Initially, the camera pans slightly to the left to follow a football player. It then moves backward throughout the video, leading the player from the front and keeping him centered in the frame as he becomes larger. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The main focus is a football player with dark skin, wearing a black helmet adorned with a light yellowish-white logo, a yellow jersey with black accents and a number, black pants, and white shoes. This player is running forward, carrying a deep red football. Directly behind him, a large, dense cloud of brown dust and debris erupts upwards from the green football field. Another football player, distinguished by a blue and white helmet and uniform, is kneeling on the grass behind the main player, having fallen down but now getting up to follow him forward. Additional football players are present on the field: some, also in blue and white uniforms, are running in the foreground and midground, while several players in both blue and white, as well as yellow and black uniforms, appear very small in the distant background.",
    "Motion": "The main football player runs forward across the green field, carrying a football. Simultaneously, a large cloud of brown dust and debris erupts upwards from the field directly behind him. Another player, initially kneeling on the grass to the right and slightly behind the main player, begins to rise after falling and starts running forward, following the main player. Other players in blue and white uniforms run in the foreground and midground, while more distant players from both teams are also visible moving on the field.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds outdoors in a large American football stadium during the daytime, under a bright, overcast sky. The lower stands are densely packed with spectators, while the upper deck reveals the yellow seating structure due to fewer occupants. Although the crowd's density makes it challenging to discern the color of their clothing, many spectators are holding yellow signs or banners, complementing the yellow facade of the upper deck on one side of the structure. The playing surface is a green grass field, marked with white lines characteristic of American football, and yellow goalposts are visible at one end. A football game is in progress, with players in athletic uniforms on the field. A prominent visual element is a large, turbulent cloud of brown dirt or dust that erupts from the field and moves across it, seemingly in conjunction with the players' movements.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially positions the main football player in the yellow jersey slightly to the left of center in the midground, running towards the camera. Several large brown dust clouds erupt from the field across the middle ground, originating behind this player and expanding laterally and rapidly towards the players and the camera. To the left and behind the main player, another player in a blue uniform is in the right-middle ground, initially kneeling. Additional players in blue are seen in the left foreground and across the middle ground, while stadium stands populated with spectators occupy the background on both the left and right sides. As the main player advances, he moves towards the center foreground, while the dust clouds continue to grow and spread across the middle ground behind him."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
