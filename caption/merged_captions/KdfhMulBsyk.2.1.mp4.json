  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a level angle at ground level, focusing on the landscape in the center of the frame. A dark grey asphalt road, marked with a white center line, occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground at the bottom and receding into the background. It is flanked on the left and right by arid, light-brown terrain in the middle ground and background. A pile of rocks sits in the middle ground and background on the right, with sparse vegetation visible in the background on the far right. The back of a person on a motorcycle is also driving along the road, who eventually disappears over the crest of a hill, under a clear blue sky that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera moves forward along the road with slight shaking, causing the foreground to rush past and the elements in the middle ground to expand and move toward the edges of the frame. This is a point-of-view shot from a low angle, likely from the front of a vehicle, driving along a paved road through a desolate, arid landscape. The camera moves steadily forward, capturing the sandy terrain with rocky outcrops under a clear blue sky. At the beginning of the video, a figure on a motorcycle is visible, disappearing over a ridge towards the end. From a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective, the camera moves forward quickly down a road. The video maintains a deep focus, but the overall image appears somewhat blurry, affecting the clarity from the road in the foreground to the distant horizon. The road, marked by a white center line, cuts through a vast and arid landscape characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain and scattered rocky outcrops under a clear, deep blue sky.",

    "Camera": "From a slightly unsteady, ground-level perspective, the camera moves forward quickly down a road. The video maintains a deep focus, but the overall image appears somewhat blurry, affecting the clarity from the road in the foreground to the distant horizon.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a long, straight asphalt road that recedes into the horizon. The road, marked by a white center line, cuts through a vast and arid landscape characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain and scattered rocky outcrops under a clear, deep blue sky. There is no distinct main subject; the camera's forward-moving perspective emphasizes the scale and desolation of the environment itself. A person on a motorcycle travels along the highway, eventually disappearing from view after cresting a ridge, accentuating the vastness and isolation of the setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view shot from a low angle, likely from the front of a vehicle, driving along a paved road through a desolate, arid landscape. The camera moves steadily forward, capturing the sandy terrain with rocky outcrops under a clear blue sky. At the beginning of the video, a figure on a motorcycle is visible, disappearing over a ridge towards the end.",
    "Scene": "The view is from a camera mounted low on the front of a vehicle moving along a straight, paved road that cuts through an arid, open landscape under a clear, blue sky. The dark asphalt road features a white dashed center line and extends forward over a slight incline into the distance. Flanking the road is dry, light-brown earth, with a pile of rocks on the right shoulder and sparse, low vegetation visible further away. Two short white pillars stand on each side of the road. A person on a motorcycle travels forward along the road, eventually disappearing over the ridge at the distant crest of the hill.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
