  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man with dark skin is framed in profile from the shoulders up, positioned in the foreground, occupying the right and central portions of the frame while facing toward the left. He has a very short, buzzed haircut and is wearing a baseball cap, a small hoop earring in his left ear, and a thin chain around his neck. He is dressed in a light-colored t-shirt with a graphic on the back featuring horizontal stripes and a mountain-like design. The camera is positioned at his level, capturing a grainy, black and white scene with a consistent, textured, and monochromatic visual style. The background is completely out of focus, creating an extremely shallow depth of field that isolates the subject. The man moves forward towards the left of the frame in profile with his mouth open. The camera, with a heavy zoom, creates a blurred background, making it challenging to discern its movement. However, it appears to be moving to the right while smoothly panning to the left to track the man. Later, he turns to his left and lowers his head. His short facial hair on his chin and jawline is visible, and his mouth remains open throughout the motion.",

    "Subject": "A man with dark skin is shown in a close-up, side-profile view in black and white. He has a very short, buzzed haircut and is wearing a baseball cap. A small hoop earring is visible in his left ear, and he wears a thin chain around his neck. He has some short facial hair on his chin and jawline. His mouth is open, and he is wearing a light-colored t-shirt that has a graphic on the back featuring horizontal stripes and a mountain-like design.",

    "Scene": "In a grainy, black and white scene, a person is captured in profile from the shoulders up. They are wearing a baseball cap, a t-shirt with a partial graphic visible on the back, and a small hoop earring. Their mouth is open. The background is completely blurred, creating an extremely shallow depth of field that isolates the subject. The video has a consistent, textured, and monochromatic visual style.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
