  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle wide shot, featuring a man with dark skin and short, dark hair positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a balcony. He wears a dark jacket with extensive white lettering and designs on his right chest, left chest, and sleeves, with a white crew-neck shirt visible underneath. He also wears dark gloves and leans forward with his hands resting on the dark, perforated metal railing of the balcony, which is in the foreground relative to him. The angular, grey concrete building occupies the background, with an overhanging section at the top of the frame. A bright, circular light fixture is visible on the top right, attached to the underside of the building's upper level, in the middle ground, while the overcast sky forms the upper background. The camera is at eye level, looking up from a low angle, and generally appears to have deep focus despite excessive motion blur. The camera smoothly and quickly tilts down, revealing more of the balcony and transitioning to show a blurred group of people on a lower balcony, now occupying the lower portion of the frame in the middle ground. The camera captures the crowd below, who are holding signs and banners.",

    "Motion": "A man stands on a balcony of a multi-story building, looking down over the railing. The camera swiftly tilts downward, revealing more of the balcony and the people below. The camera captures the crowd below, who are holding signs and banners.",
    "Scene": "The scene, captured from an objective point of view, presents a low-angle perspective of a person on a balcony of a multi-story building under an overcast, grey sky. The building features angular, grey concrete construction with a flat roof and overhanging sections. The balcony is enclosed by a dark, perforated metal railing. A single, bright, circular light fixture is visible on the underside of the building's upper level. The camera then swiftly tilts downward, revealing a blurred view of a group of people standing on the lower floor's balcony.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
