  "merged_caption": "This video presents a dynamic shot of a grey brick building wall in an urban alley. The camera, shot from a level, eye-level perspective, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it smoothly moves left and forward, capturing the wall positioned at an angle, extending from the right foreground to the left background. The scene is initially plain, featuring a doorway on the far right, a boarded-up arched window in the center-left with a metal grate, and a \"NO PARKING\" sign in the middle ground on the left. Colorful, cartoon-like animations of characters, objects, and musical notes gradually appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. First, a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a pink horn materializes in the right foreground, from which musical notes emerge. Simultaneously, a stylized yellow fire hydrant appears beside the window, a blue character appears to its left, and a small, colorful bush forms in the bottom left. Subsequently, a black lamppost appears to the left of the arched window, and a large green tree-like figure on a pink base materializes on the left side of the frame, creating a complete mural. The camera captures the evolving mural from different angles, maintaining a coherent narrative of the transformation of the space.",

    "Camera": "Shot from a level, eye-level perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It moves smoothly forward and to the left, tracking along the brick wall adorned with colorful animated cartoon graphics.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot focused on the side of a grey brick building in an urban alley. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the environment and showcase the transformation of the space. The scene is initially a plain brick wall featuring a boarded-up, arched window with a security grate, a \"NO PARKING\" sign, and a doorway on the right. Colorful, flat-style animated graphics then appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. This includes a large orange hand holding a green and pink horn that emits musical notes, a stylized fire hydrant, a blue character sitting next to a lamppost, and green leaves on a pink and white base that looks like roots.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a dynamic shot of a grey brick wall in an alley, with the camera moving parallel to the wall. Colorful, cartoon-like animations of characters, objects, and musical notes gradually appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. The animation builds up over time, with the camera capturing the evolving mural from different angles.",
    "Scene": "On an urban street, colorful animated graffiti appears on a grey brick wall. The scene features a boarded-up, arched window with a metal grate and a \"NO PARKING\" sign on a pole. The animation begins with a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a pink horn, from which musical notes emerge. Subsequently, a blue character sitting on the ground, a lamppost, a yellow fire hydrant, and a large, stylized plant with a pink trunk and branches, along with green leaves, materialize on the wall, creating a vibrant mural against the muted background.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a dynamic shot of a grey brick building wall in an urban alley. The camera smoothly moves left and forward, capturing the wall positioned at an angle, extending from the right foreground to the left background. The scene is initially plain, featuring a doorway on the far right, a boarded-up arched window in the center-left, and a \"NO PARKING\" sign in the middle ground on the left. Animated graphics then appear sequentially on the wall. First, a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a horn materializes in the right foreground. Simultaneously, a stylized yellow fire hydrant appears beside the window, a blue character appears to its left, and a small, colorful bush forms in the bottom left. Subsequently, a black lamppost appears to the left of the arched window, and a large green tree-like figure on a pink base materializes on the left side of the frame, creating a complete mural. The camera remains at an eye-level height throughout the transformation."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
