  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The foreground and middle ground feature a flat expanse of dry, sandy ground with sparse, low green vegetation, occupying the lower portion of the frame. A line of green trees stretches horizontally across the background under a mostly overcast sky filled with greyish-white clouds, though some patches of blue are visible. The overcast sky fills the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly pans left, revealing more of the wide, open landscape and the distant tree line under a cloudy sky. The movement is very steady, with no shaking, emphasizing the vastness and emptiness of the landscape rather than any specific object. The setting is outdoors during the daytime, and the horizon is lined with distant trees, creating a sense of depth and scale. The focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, highlighting the vastness and emptiness of the landscape.",

    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open expanse of dry, barren land with sparse patches of vegetation. The sky is overcast with a thick layer of clouds, allowing only a hint of blue to peek through. The horizon is lined with distant trees, creating a sense of depth and scale. The focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the vastness and emptiness of the landscape rather than any specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a vast, barren field with sparse patches of vegetation under a partly cloudy sky. The camera slowly pans from right to left, revealing more of the empty landscape and the distant tree line.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a wide, flat expanse of dry, sandy ground dotted with sparse, low green vegetation. In the background, a line of green trees stretches across the horizon under a mostly overcast sky filled with greyish-white clouds, though some patches of blue are visible. The setting is outdoors during the daytime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
