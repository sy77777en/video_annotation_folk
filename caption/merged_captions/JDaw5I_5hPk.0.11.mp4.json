  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. He walks away from the camera across a wet, sandy beach that extends from the foreground into the background and occupies the bottom of the frame. The man, seen from behind, is wearing blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest. He carries a camera mounted on a tripod in his right hand as he moves toward the foggy background. In the background, large rock formations are visible on the left, while a green, tree-covered hillside extends from the center to the right, with all background elements partially obscured by fog. The flat, gray sand is marked with footprints and reflects the muted light. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the scene in slow motion with a slightly unsteady angle. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire foggy beach scene, including the man walking away from the camera, in sharp detail. The thick blanket of fog adds a sense of mystery to the expansive shoreline, where the man, of average build with short, dark hair, continues his solitary walk.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady camera positioned at an eye-level and level angle. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire foggy beach scene, including the man walking away from the camera, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A man is seen from behind, walking away from the camera on a wet, sandy beach. He is wearing blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest. In his right hand, he carries a camera mounted on a tripod. He has short, dark hair and appears to be of average build.",
    "Motion": "A man walks away from the camera across a wide, wet, sandy beach. He carries a camera mounted on a tripod in his right hand as he moves toward the foggy background.",
    "Scene": "A man walks along a wide, wet sand beach under a thick blanket of fog. In the background, large, moss-covered sea stacks and a green, tree-covered hillside are partially obscured by the mist. The flat, gray sand is marked with footprints and reflects the muted light. The man, seen from behind, wears blue jeans and a dark vest and carries camera equipment as he moves away from the viewer across the expansive shoreline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
