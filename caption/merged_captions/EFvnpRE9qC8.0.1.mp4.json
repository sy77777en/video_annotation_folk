  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a woman with light skin and long, straight hair, wearing a sleeveless, ankle-length white dress and light-colored long socks without shoes, standing in the center of the frame and the middle ground on the top level of an outdoor parking structure at night. The ground is painted green with white parking lines, bordered by a low concrete wall stretching across the middle ground behind her. In the background, a bright full moon is positioned in the top left against a dark sky, with faint outlines of distant buildings. The scene is illuminated by artificial lighting, casting a focused, circular pool of light on the ground, highlighting the smooth texture of the pavement and creating strong shadows. The video, captured in slow motion from a fixed, slightly unsteady, eye-level camera at a level angle, begins out of focus and transitions to deep focus, bringing the woman into sharp view. She stands upright with her hands loosely clasped in front of her body, initially looking toward the camera before turning her head to her right. During this, she slightly shifts her right foot to the side, adjusting her stance for better balance. To the left, in the midground, a piece of lighting equipment on a tripod is partially visible. Although there is noticeable shaking, the camera manages to keep the woman centered in the frame throughout the shot. Her facial expression appears neutral, and the lighting highlights her figure against the dark background, making her the clear focal point. The overall scene is quiet and still, with no visible movement apart from the subtle changes in the subject’s stance.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady, eye-level camera at a level angle. The shot begins out of focus and then transitions to deep focus, bringing a woman in a white dress on a rooftop into sharp view.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with light skin and long, straight hair, wearing a sleeveless, ankle-length white dress and light-colored long socks without shoes. She stands upright in the center of the scene, sometimes looking toward the camera and then turning her head to the left side of the scene. Her hands are loosely clasped in front of her body, and her facial expression appears neutral. The lighting highlights her figure against a dark background, making her the clear focal point throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The woman stands upright in the center of the scene with her hands loosely clasped in front of her body. She first looks toward the camera, then turns her head to the left side of the scene while maintaining her standing position. During this, she slightly shifts her right foot to the side, adjusting her stance for better balance. No other significant movement occurs.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place at night on the top level of an outdoor parking structure, with a dark sky and a bright full moon visible near the horizon. The ground is painted green with white parking lines, and the area is bordered by a low concrete wall. Artificial lighting casts a focused, circular pool of light on the ground, creating strong shadows and highlighting the smooth texture of the pavement. A person in a long, white, sleeveless dress stands in the center of the lit area, with their posture and gaze shifting slightly throughout the sequence. The background remains dim, with only faint outlines of distant buildings and the moon providing additional visual elements. The overall scene is quiet and still, with no visible movement apart from the subtle changes in the subject’s stance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
