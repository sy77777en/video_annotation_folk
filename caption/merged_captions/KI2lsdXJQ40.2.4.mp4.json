  "merged_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, framing the main subjects from about the waist up. The woman with a maroon necklace stands in the right foreground at first, occupying the right of the frame, while a small white table with a vase of white flowers, a gold-framed portrait of a person with pale skin and dark eyes, and a small plate with a slice of cake and a red candle is positioned in the center and center-left foreground. The older man in a green suit is in the background, initially centered but shifting left as the camera moves. Another woman, reading, is in the middle ground on the left side, and a white chair and a white sofa are set back to the back wall. The woman in the foreground walks rightward to stand side by side with the man in the foreground, gives a plate to him, and they occupy the left and the center of the frame at the end. Several other figures are visible in the background, spaced across the width of the frame and positioned further from the camera. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, using a smooth, eye-level tracking shot with a level angle that moves rightward, following the woman from the side. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in the foreground in sharp focus while the background remains blurred. The woman in the dark blue dress stands holding a plate of food, then reaches forward to pick up a small plate with a slice of cake and a candle from the table beside the framed portrait. She walks to the right for some distance and then stays still to give the plate in her left hand to the man in the black suit, who receives it without moving. The figures maintain upright, rigid postures with minimal movement, except for the prominent woman’s actions of taking the plate from the table and giving another plate to the man, while the man receives it.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video uses a smooth, eye-level tracking shot with a level angle that moves rightward, following a woman with glasses from the side. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in the foreground in sharp focus while the background remains blurred.",
    "Subject": "The video features several stylized claymation figures with exaggerated facial features and elongated heads. The most prominent subject is a woman with pale skin, short brown hair with bangs, and a maroon beaded necklace, wearing a dark blue dress with a diamond pattern. She holds two small plates of food and has a serious expression. As she approaches a man with light skin, short brown hair, and a somber face, dressed in a black suit and white shirt, she stands beside him and hands him one of the plates, which he accepts. In the background, another woman with short dark hair and a dark dress is seen reading, while an older man with a bald head and gray hair on the sides, wearing a green suit, initially stands still in the center and gradually moves to the left as the camera shifts. A framed portrait of a man with a long face and blue shirt, along with a vase of white flowers and a small plate with a slice of cake and a candle, are placed on a table, suggesting a commemorative setting. The prominent woman soon takes the small plate with the slice of cake and candle. The characters’ faces are marked by visible brushstrokes and blush, giving them a handcrafted, textured appearance.",
    "Motion": "The woman in the dark blue dress stands holding a plate of food, then reaches forward to pick up a small plate with a slice of cake and a candle from the table beside the framed portrait. She walks to the right for some distance and then stays still to give the plate in her left hand to the man in the black suit, who receives it without moving. In the middleground, another woman remains seated and reads without changing position, but goes out of frame as the camera moves rightward. The older man in the green suit, initially at the center, gradually shifts to the left as the camera pans across the scene. The figures maintain upright, rigid postures with minimal movement, except for the prominent woman’s actions of taking the plate from the table and giving another plate to the man, while the man receives it.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue walls and a parquet floor, giving the environment a subdued atmosphere. In the foreground, a small white table holds a vase of white flowers with green stems and leaves, a gold-framed portrait of a person with pale skin and dark eyes, and a small plate with a slice of cake and a red candle. Several figures with stylized, elongated heads and painted facial features are present, dressed in dark, formal clothing. The room contains white chairs with dark frames arranged along the walls, and the overall scene is calm, with no visible movement or dramatic changes in lighting. There are no overlays or on-screen text elements present. The slice of cake on the white table is soon taken by the woman in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a medium shot, framing the main subjects from about the waist up. The woman with the maroon necklace stands in the right foreground at first, occupying the right of the frame, while a small white table with a vase of flowers, a framed portrait, and a plate of cake is positioned in the center and center-left foreground.

Several other figures are visible in the background, spaced across the width of the frame and positioned further from the camera. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, and the spatial arrangement emphasizes the foreground subjects while maintaining clear separation from the background elements. The only notable movement is the woman taking the plate of cake from the table, walking rightward, giving it to the man, and the man receiving it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
