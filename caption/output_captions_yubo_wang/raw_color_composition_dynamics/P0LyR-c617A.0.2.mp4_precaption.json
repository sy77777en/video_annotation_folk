    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant. (no need to mention).\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has a balanced saturation level, neither too vivid nor too muted. (no need to mention).\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video shows a bright and well-lit scene, with high light levels and clearly visible details without much overexposure.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a color video depicting a rider wearing a blue top and dark pants on a brown horse equipped with a bright pink saddle pad, maneuvering around a blue barrel within a reddish-brown dirt arena. The background consists of green trees, a metallic fence, and a clear sky. The overall color palette is warm, primarily due to the bright sunlight illuminating the earthy tones of the arena floor. Saturation levels appear natural, allowing colors like the rider's blue top, the pink saddle pad, and the green trees to be distinct without being overly vivid. The video is very bright, typical of an outdoor scene under strong sunlight, resulting in clear visibility and distinct shadows. There are no prominent color grading effects altering the natural appearance of the scene.",
