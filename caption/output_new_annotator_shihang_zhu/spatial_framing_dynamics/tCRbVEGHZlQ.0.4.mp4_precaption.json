    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a solid black silhouette of a humanoid figure, notable for its complete lack of discernible features, clothing, or details beyond its basic form, which includes a round head, torso, limbs, and blocky feet. A black straight line represents the ground, along which a few sparse, simple dark green lines depict blades of grass. Also visible is a brown, rectangular briefcase lying open on the ground, revealing white rectangular contents resembling papers; its handle and latches are depicted.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated cartoon video features a side-view perspective of a character in a minimalist outdoor scene against a plain white background. A thin black line represents the ground, sparsely dotted with small green tufts of grass. A black silhouette stick figure walks across this landscape from left to right. During the video, an open, brown rectangular briefcase containing white paper appears resting on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as a full shot. Initially, a black silhouette figure stands in the center middle ground on a black horizontal line at the bottom middle ground. Sparse green lines representing grass are located in the bottom left and bottom center middle ground. The figure then walks from the center towards the right side of the frame, staying within the middle ground. As the figure approaches the right, an open brown briefcase appears on the bottom right middle ground, resting on the horizontal line. Additional green grass lines also appear scattered along the bottom middle ground as the figure moves. The camera maintains a position level with the figure's height throughout the sequence.",
