    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide view of a snow-covered path in the center, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. A snow-covered structure occupies the left foreground and middle ground, while a large snow pile is positioned on the right foreground and middle ground. A forest lines the background under an overcast sky at the top. The camera then quickly tilts downwards, transitioning to a first-person perspective from a sled. In this final framing, the sled's steering wheel and the operator's hands are in the center foreground, with their legs visible in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. The snowy path remains central, extending forward from the foreground. Parts of the snow pile on the right and the structure on the left are visible in the middle ground, with the forest partially visible in the top background. The camera is positioned low, on the sled, looking forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person view of a person riding a snow sled down a wide, snow-covered path marked with tracks. The person's hands, clad in a black winter jacket, grip the black steering wheel of the sled. His or her legs, covered in dark grey pants, and feet in dark shoes rest on the sled's frame, which appears metallic with blue details. The path is bordered on the left by a low, snow-covered structure and on the right by a large pile of snow. In the background, a forest of evergreen trees stands under an overcast sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a snowy outdoor scene under a cloudy sky. The view looks down a snow-covered track marked with previous sled or vehicle trails, leading towards a forest of tall coniferous trees in the background. Large snowbanks line the right side of the track. On the left, a portion of a building with a snow-laden roof and a wire mesh base is visible. The camera perspective shifts downwards to show the operator's hands holding the black steering wheel of a small sled, or snow racer, which has metal skis and blue markings. The operator is wearing a black jacket and grey pants, seated on the sled positioned on the snowy track.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
