    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a woman and a man appear to be sitting close together in a moving car at night, inferred from the background, although the car itself is not visible in the frame. The woman, positioned on the left, has dark, short, wavy hair and wears a dark top complemented by a colorful patterned scarf around her neck featuring red, yellow, blue, and green hues. She is looking upwards and slightly to her right, her mouth slightly parted. The man, sitting to her right, has short, dark hair. He is dressed in a light-colored collared shirt layered under a dark jacket. He is also looking upwards and slightly to his right, with a subtle smile. The scene is dimly lit, with light primarily illuminating their faces from below and the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set outdoors at night. The scene is very dark, with the silhouettes of trees visible against the night sky. A building structure is faintly discernible on the left side. A small, bright light briefly appears in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot featuring a woman in the left foreground and a man in the right foreground. Initially, both subjects are dimly lit and looking slightly off-center. They then turn their heads to look upwards and slightly towards the right side of the frame. In the background, the silhouettes of trees are visible at the top, and a faint building structure is on the far left. A small, bright light briefly appears in the lower center background. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
