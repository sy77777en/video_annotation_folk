    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot, framing several large, skinless humanoid figures from the waist up against a cloudy sky. The central figure occupies the center middle ground, flanked by another figure to the left middle ground and one to the right middle ground. Other figures and an explosion are visible in the background, partially obscured by clouds and smoke filling the middle ground and background. The camera then tilts downwards, transitioning the framing. This movement shifts the shot size to a medium shot, bringing a harbor scene into view in the lower half of the frame while the lower portions of the humanoid figures remain visible in the top half, now positioned further in the background relative to the newly revealed foreground elements. In the final composition, a seaplane is positioned in the bottom left foreground on the water, a hangar is on the left middle ground, a dock occupies the bottom center/right middle ground, and a ship emitting smoke is on the right middle ground. The camera maintains a low angle throughout, looking up at the towering figures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video's main subjects are several immense, skinless humanoid figures standing amidst clouds of steam against a dramatic sky. These towering figures, depicted with detailed red musculature, dominate the scene. The central figure appears to be kneeling, possibly under attack, while others adopt different poses, including one gesturing with raised arms and another seemingly being struck or exploding in the distance. As the camera tilts down, secondary subjects are revealed at a waterfront below: a light-colored biplane seaplane moves on the water near a dock, alongside various buildings including a large hangar. A dark-hulled steamer ship emitting black smoke is moored nearby, with minuscule human figures visible on the dock. The composition emphasizes the overwhelming presence of the giant figures compared to the human settlement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene at a waterfront harbor during sunset or dusk, under a sky filled with purple and orange clouds mixed with smoke. Several very large, red, skinless humanoid figures with defined musculature stand tall, emerging from the clouds and smoke; one figure in the background appears to be collapsing as if under attack. The harbor below includes water, a dock area with a large hangar, other buildings including one with castle-like towers, a docked ship emitting black smoke, and a seaplane moving on the water near the dock. One of the giant figures gestures with an outstretched arm.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
