    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, set within a wood-paneled room featuring a brick fireplace, four individuals are present. A woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white plaid short-sleeved dress, is positioned centrally and appears to be moving rapidly towards the right. Near the fireplace, a man with short, light brown hair, wearing a yellow V-neck sweater vest over a light collared shirt and dark trousers, stands smiling while holding another woman. This woman, whom he is holding, wears a cream-colored dress or coat and a matching hat, facing the man. A younger woman or girl with dark, shoulder-length hair, wearing a distinctive red hat and a dark patterned top, is running alongside the other three individuals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor scene set in a room with dark wood-paneled walls. A prominent brick fireplace with a wooden mantelpiece occupies one side of the room. Nearby stands a tall floor lamp with a dark lampshade. Opposite the fireplace, a light-colored sofa with a green and blue plaid throw blanket is visible, next to a table lamp featuring an orange pleated shade on a brass base. A round wooden coffee table sits in the foreground. On the back wall, a framed picture, possibly a world map, is displayed. Four individuals are present: a woman in a red sweater and jeans is seated on the sofa, reading a book; a man in a gray suit stands by the fireplace, gesturing as he speaks; a young girl in a yellow dress is playing with a toy on the floor; and an older man with glasses, wearing a blue cardigan, is examining the framed picture on the wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, the scene is captured in a medium full shot. A woman in a plaid dress occupies the center middle ground, moving rapidly towards the right. To her left in the middle ground, a girl wearing a red hat moves alongside her. Positioned in the right middle ground, near a brick fireplace located in the right background/middle ground, a man holds a woman dressed in cream. A sofa is visible in the left middle ground, with a framed picture displayed on the top left background wall and a round coffee table in the bottom foreground. The framing then transitions, tightening into a medium shot. During this transition, the woman in the plaid dress moves prominently into the center/left foreground, beginning to exit the frame towards the right. As a result, the man and the woman he holds shift further into the right background and become partially obscured, similar to the girl in the red hat who is now mostly hidden in the left background. A floor lamp near the fireplace becomes more noticeable in the right foreground/middle ground. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
