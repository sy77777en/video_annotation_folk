    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a man with dark hair and a mustache, wearing a green conductor's hat, a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark tie, a dark grey vest with gold buttons and a yellow stripe, and green trousers, is seen inside a train compartment through a window. Snow or rain falls outside. Initially standing with one hand on his hip, he briefly picks up and replaces a wall-mounted handset. He then pulls the window down halfway, leans his forearms on the frame, and looks out to his left before turning to look to his right. He wears a watch on his left wrist, and a pocket watch chain hangs from his vest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video provides a view into a train compartment through a rectangular window, which has a noticeable crack in its upper left corner. The interior of the compartment is characterized by green walls, a bulletin board displaying various papers or maps, and a desk area equipped with items including a lamp and a telephone system. Outside the window, the grey, horizontally ribbed exterior of the train car is visible, along with falling white particles, suggesting snow or rain against the moving backdrop. A man dressed in a conductor-style uniform\u2014comprising a green hat, white shirt, dark vest, and green trousers\u2014is seen within the compartment. He briefly handles a wall-mounted phone before pulling the window down and leaning his arms on the windowsill.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot centers on a man inside a train compartment, viewed through a window that occupies the foreground. The man is positioned centrally in the middle ground, visible from the waist up. Behind him, the compartment interior serves as the background, featuring a bulletin board slightly to the left and a phone system further left. The train's exterior and falling particles are visible outside the window, forming the outermost background. Initially, the man reaches towards the left middle ground to handle the phone. He then raises his hands to the top center foreground, grasps the window handle, and pulls the window down, altering the foreground framing. Finally, he leans forward, placing his forearms on the lowered window frame in the foreground, shifting slightly forward in the middle ground while remaining centered. He turns his head first to the left and then to the right. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",
