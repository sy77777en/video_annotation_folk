    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot within a large, industrial-style pig barn. The camera looks down a long, central aisle flanked by rows upon rows of metal pens containing pigs. The structure features a high, arched ceiling with visible support beams, creating a sense of vast, repetitive space. A black dog barking in the center of the frame adds a dynamic element to the scene, drawing attention amidst the otherwise static environment. There is no main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on the environment itself\u2014its scale, uniformity, and the somewhat bleak atmosphere created by the dim lighting and the confinement of the animals. The lone figure walking down the aisle is small within the expansive frame, serving primarily to establish the scale of the barn rather than acting as a central point of interest, thereby emphasizing the setting over any individual character or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures the interior of a long, narrow structure featuring an arched roof constructed with a metal framework and semi-transparent panels. Rows of dark metal pens, containing pigs, line both sides of a central concrete walkway. A black dog is seen barking near the pens. The scene is dimly lit. Overlaid text appears at the bottom center, displaying Chinese characters above the English subtitle \"Stop acting like pigs!\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot capturing the interior scenery of a long barn. The arched structure fills the frame, extending symmetrically from the foreground deep into the background along the center. Rows of metal pens containing pigs flank the central concrete aisle on both the left and right sides, receding from the foreground into the background. A black dog is positioned in the center of the frame, within the middle ground on the aisle. Text overlays are visible in the bottom center foreground. The camera remains static throughout the shot, positioned at approximately eye level looking straight down the central aisle.",
