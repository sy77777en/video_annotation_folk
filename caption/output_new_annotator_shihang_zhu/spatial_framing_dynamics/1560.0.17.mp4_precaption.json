    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a young man with light skin and short, light brown hair walks across a snow-covered path. He is wearing a tan jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, blue jeans, and brown shoes, and is carrying a backpack. In the background, another person, appearing to be male and dressed in dark clothing, sits on a bench to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a snow-covered courtyard during the daytime under an overcast sky. A large, beige building with arched windows forms the backdrop. Bare deciduous trees, their branches dusted with snow, are scattered throughout the area, with one large tree prominent near the center. Trimmed hedges, also covered in snow, line a pathway, and bushes in the background add depth to the scene. A person walks along this path through the snow, while another individual sits on a park bench in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot where the main subject, a man, is initially positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. He walks horizontally across the frame towards the right, remaining in the middle ground. To his right, further back in the middle ground/background, another person sits on a bench. A snow-covered path occupies the lower portion of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the right middle ground. Hedges line this path in the middle ground. A large tree is prominent in the center-left background, with a large building forming the background across the top of the frame. Bushes are visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
