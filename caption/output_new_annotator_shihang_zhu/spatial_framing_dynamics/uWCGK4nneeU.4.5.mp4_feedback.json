    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with an extreme wide shot, capturing a vast desert landscape occupying the bottom half of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, beneath a clear sky in the top half. Distant mountains form the background horizon. A single white cloud is positioned centrally in the sky, acting as a focal point in the middle ground. Shortly after the start, a small helicopter enters from the far left edge in the top left quadrant, flying horizontally rightward towards the center, remaining in the background relative to the hills. Simultaneously, a larger airplane enters from the far right edge in the top right quadrant, flying horizontally leftward towards the center, also in the background. Both aircraft maintain their altitude, flanking the central cloud as they move towards the middle of the frame. The camera remains static and positioned below the flight path of the aircraft throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a wide shot of a desert landscape characterized by rolling, brown, textured hills beneath a clear, light blue sky. Centrally located in the sky is a single, prominent, fluffy white cloud. Entering the scene from the left is a small, dark-colored helicopter, flying horizontally and emitting a thin, yellowish smoke trail. Simultaneously, a larger airplane enters from the right side, also flying horizontally. This airplane has a reddish-brown fuselage and wings, and it leaves a thicker trail of white smoke or vapor from its rear. Both aircraft appear relatively small against the vast landscape and fly towards the center of the frame, positioned on either side of the central cloud.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a vast, arid desert landscape under a clear blue sky during the daytime. Rolling, sandy hills fill the foreground, receding towards hazy mountains in the distance. A single, white, fluffy cloud is positioned centrally in the sky. A small, dark-colored airplane flies from the left side of the scene towards the right, leaving a thin yellow trail behind it. Approaching from the right side is a larger, reddish-brown airplane flying towards the left. This larger aircraft deploys a parachute-like object from its rear, which is accompanied by a trail of white smoke or vapor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a mountain range and the sky, initially fully in focus, with a cloud at the center of the frame. Shortly after, a helicopter enters from the left and a plane from the right, moving simultaneously toward the frame's center, occupying about 10% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subjects appear, the camera is below the subjects, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
