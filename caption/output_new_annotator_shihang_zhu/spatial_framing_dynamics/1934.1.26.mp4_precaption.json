    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One person stands out by wearing a tall, red top hat. They are all gathered closely around a small, black rectangular screen mounted on a white structure, but their attention is directed towards a small figurine placed in front of the screen on the table. Their body language suggests curiosity or interest in the figurine. The scene is minimalistic, with the subjects being the primary focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a stark white room featuring white walls and flooring. Central to the scene is a white, blocky structure with a rectangular black opening near the top. Several figures clad in white jumpsuits with orange trim are gathered around this structure. One figure, distinguished by a red top hat, leans towards the opening, while another figure points towards it. Meanwhile, the individual positioned furthest to the right is focused on their own task, separate from the group's activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot featuring five figures grouped around a central structure. One figure occupies the left foreground, pointing towards the center. The white structure with a black screen is in the center middle ground. A figure wearing a red top hat is positioned in the center middle ground, leaning towards the structure. Another figure stands in the center-right middle ground, next to the one with the hat. A fourth figure is visible in the center background, behind the figure with the hat, and a fifth figure stands in the right middle ground/background. The subjects and camera remain relatively static throughout the brief clip. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
