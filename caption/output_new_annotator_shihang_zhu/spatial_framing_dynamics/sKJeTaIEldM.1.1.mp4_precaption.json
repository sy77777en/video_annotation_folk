    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person in a dimly lit indoor setting. Initially, the person is seen from behind, wearing dark clothing, possibly a jersey or sweatshirt, with a light-colored number \"65\" visible on the back, moving quickly away from the camera. Later, the same person, now clad in dark clothing and a dark, hooded garment or mask that obscures their head and face, stands on a spiral staircase, holding onto the metallic railing with both arms outstretched, facing upwards along the stairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene at night, focusing on a dark spiral staircase with a shiny, metallic handrail attached to a building. A figure in dark clothing, moving quickly with their back to the camera, ascends the stairs from the bottom right to the top left of the frame. The surrounding environment is dimly lit, revealing parts of the building structure, including pillars and what appears to be an upper level or balcony. A hanging lantern-style light fixture is visible near the top of the staircase, and a section of an orange-colored wall or door briefly comes into view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, the video presents a close-up shot focused on the back of a person in dark clothing, occupying the center-left of the frame in the foreground/middle ground, moving away from the camera which is positioned at their level. The shot then transitions to a wide shot, capturing the person now standing on the lower section of a spiral staircase located in the center-left of the frame and the middle ground. The staircase ascends from the bottom right towards the top left. The person faces upwards along the stairs. A metallic handrail follows the staircase curve in the middle ground. A lantern is visible in the top right, middle ground, while building structures occupy the background on the right and bottom. In this final framing, the camera is positioned below the subject, looking upwards.",
