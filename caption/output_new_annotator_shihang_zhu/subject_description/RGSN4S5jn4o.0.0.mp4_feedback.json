    "pre_caption": "In the video, a street scene unfolds featuring several pedestrians and a changing crosswalk. Initially, a Black man wearing a light green shirt, blue jeans, tan boots, and a black backpack walks across a crosswalk painted with a large black and white checkerboard pattern. Behind him, a white man in a dark hoodie rides a bicycle, and a yellow taxi drives further down the street. On the left sidewalk, another man in a yellow beanie and greenish-brown jacket walks away, near a flower stand where several other people are gathered. The crosswalk pattern then dynamically changes into a complex abstract design of white lines on the dark pavement. An animated cartoon woman with pink hair, wearing a green jacket, yellow pants, and carrying a pink creature, walks across this newly patterned crosswalk. Following her are an older Asian man in a dark suit and another man wearing a green cap and brown jacket. Throughout the sequence, white animated line-art icons, including a stylized hand or flame symbol and a brush selection interface, are overlaid onto the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject\u2019s type, using precise terms such as \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d or \u201ctree,\u201d rather than vague words like \u201cthing\u201d or \u201citem.\u201d If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject\u2019s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as \u201cthe man,\u201d \u201cthe dog,\u201d or \u201cthe tree.\u201d If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., \u201cthe woman in the red dress,\u201d \u201cthe man with the beard\u201d), location within the scene (e.g., \u201cthe man on the left,\u201d \u201cthe car in the midground\u201d), actions (e.g., \u201cthe child playing with a ball,\u201d \u201cthe bird flying\u201d), or relationships to each other (e.g., \u201cthe man next to the woman,\u201d \u201cthe first man that enters the frame\u201d). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn\u2019t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

She is followed by an older Asian man in a gray suit and a younger man wearing a mustard yellow utility-style jacket over a light teal hoodie and navy pants. After the transformation into animated cartoon style, the woman now wears a muted teal-blue jacket over a light green top and pants, while the younger man appears in a pink jacket over an ivory-colored hoodie and blue pants. They all walk across a newly patterned crosswalk, maintaining their formation as their appearances shift from realism to stylization.",
