    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person perspective of a person sitting stationary on a snowracer on a snow-covered path. The person, whose hands and legs are visible, is wearing a black jacket and grey pants. He is holding a black, three-spoke steering wheel. The snowracer has a blue and silver body with the words \"STIGA SNOWRACER\" visible in white and blue lettering. The path is marked by tire tracks in the snow, with large snowbanks on either side. In the background, a line of dark green coniferous trees stands against an overcast sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a person sitting stationary on a snowracer sled on a snow-covered trail. The trail is flanked by large snowbanks and a forest of coniferous trees under an overcast sky. The person, positioned in the lower part of the frame, is wearing a black jacket and grey pants, with only their legs and hands visible as they hold a black steering wheel. The blue and silver sled has \"STIGA\" and \"SNOWRACER\" printed on it. Tire tracks and sled tracks are visible in the snow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a snow-covered path occupying the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A large snowbank is on the left middle ground, and another is on the right middle ground. In the background, a line of dark green coniferous trees is visible across the frame, with an overcast sky in the top background. The camera then tilts downwards, transitioning to a first-person perspective. In this new framing, the person's legs are in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. Their right hand is in the center foreground, holding a black steering wheel, which is also in the center foreground. A portion of the blue and silver snowracer body is visible in the bottom center foreground. The snow-covered path, with visible tracks, now fills most of the frame, stretching from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the person's eye level, looking slightly downwards.",
