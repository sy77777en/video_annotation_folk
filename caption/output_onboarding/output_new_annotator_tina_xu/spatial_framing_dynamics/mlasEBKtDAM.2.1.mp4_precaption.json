    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video's main subjects are several colossal, skinless humanoid figures, identifiable as Colossal Titans from the anime \"Attack on Titan.\" These giants possess exposed red musculature across their entire bodies, including highly defined abdominal and pectoral muscles. They stand extremely tall amidst clouds or steam under a dramatic blue sky. One central Titan is the most prominent, standing still, while another to the left gestures with raised arms. An explosion is visible in the sky behind the central Titan. These massive figures tower over a port scene in the foreground, which includes secondary subjects: a light-colored biplane seaplane floating on the water near a dock, a large, dark-hulled ship emitting black smoke, a large hangar with green doors, and other smaller buildings with red roofs. The Titans initially walk toward the port, but they begin collapsing one by one onto the ground after being shot in the head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor scene set at a harbor during late afternoon or sunset, featuring a dramatic sky with purple and orange hues filled with large, billowing clouds. Several colossal, red, skinless humanoid figures dominate the view, emerging from or standing amongst the clouds and smoke, towering over the waterfront below. The central colossal titan is shot in the head, leading to an explosion, after which the others collapse. The harbor itself includes a body of water where a seaplane is taxiing near a dock. Adjacent to the dock are several buildings, including a large warehouse or hangar and other structures with orange tiled roofs. A large, dark-hulled ship with a smoking funnel is moored at the dock.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot, framing several colossal, skinless humanoid figures (Titans) from the waist up against a dramatic sky. The most prominent Titan is positioned in the center middle ground, flanked by another Titan to the right middle ground and one gesturing with raised arms to the left middle ground. Other Titans are partially visible in the background and bottom left. An explosion occurs in the top right background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the Titans. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera tilts down and pulls back slightly, revealing a harbor scene in the foreground. In this final framing, the Titans occupy the middle ground and background, towering over the foreground elements. A seaplane is in the bottom left foreground on the water, next to a dock with a hangar and other buildings positioned in the left and center foreground. A large ship emitting smoke is visible in the right foreground and middle ground. The low camera angle looking up at the Titans is maintained throughout the transition.",
