    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two aircraft flying towards the center of the frame over a desert mountain landscape under a clear blue sky with a single white cloud. On the left, a small, dark-colored helicopter flies towards the right, leaving a thin yellow smoke trail behind it. On the right, a larger, reddish-brown airplane flies towards the left, emitting a thick white smoke or vapor trail from its rear, possibly indicating engine exhaust or the deployment of an object like a drogue chute. Both aircraft appear simultaneously and move towards the central cloud.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a clear, light blue sky over a vast, arid desert landscape featuring rolling, brown, textured hills stretching into the hazy distance. Centered in the sky is a single, fluffy white cloud. As the video progresses, two airplanes enter the scene from opposite sides. A smaller aircraft appears from the left, flying towards the right and leaving a thin yellow trail behind it. Meanwhile, a larger, reddish-brown airplane enters from the right, flying towards the left and emitting a thick white trail from its rear, where a parachute-like object is also deployed. The planes move towards each other, flanking the central cloud.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a mountain range and the sky, initially fully in focus, with a cloud at the center of the frame. Shortly after, a helicopter enters from the left and a plane from the right, moving simultaneously toward the frame's center, occupying about 10% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subjects appear, the camera is below the subjects, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a wide shot, where the light blue sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame and a desert mountain landscape fills the bottom third, stretching from the middle ground into the hazy background. A single white cloud is positioned in the center of the frame, within the sky's middle ground. Shortly after the start, a small helicopter enters from the far left edge, moving horizontally towards the center-left in the middle ground. Simultaneously, a larger airplane enters from the far right edge, moving horizontally towards the center-right, also in the middle ground. Both aircraft fly towards the central cloud, each occupying roughly 10% of the frame's height. A yellow trail extends from the left edge behind the helicopter, and a white trail extends from the right edge behind the airplane. The camera remains stationary and positioned below the flight path of both aircraft.",
