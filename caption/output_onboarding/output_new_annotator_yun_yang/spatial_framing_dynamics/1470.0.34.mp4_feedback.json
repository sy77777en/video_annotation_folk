    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of the subjects, capturing all four individuals in the room. Initially, the man in the yellow sweater and dark pants is positioned near the center-right of the frame, slightly in the foreground. The woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white checkered dress, is on the left side, also in the foreground. The child in a patterned suit and red hat is seated on the sofa in the background, towards the left. The woman with a towel on her head and a white robe is behind the man in the yellow sweater, closer to the center. As the video progresses, the shot size changes to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the central action. The man in the yellow sweater moves slightly to the right, maintaining his position in the foreground. The blonde woman shifts towards the center, still in the foreground. The child remains seated on the sofa in the background, while the woman in the robe moves closer to the man in the yellow sweater, staying in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. The sofa with the patterned blanket and the floor lamp with an orange shade are consistently visible in the background, along with the wood-paneled walls and brick fireplace",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four people inside a room. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white plaid dress, is prominently featured moving quickly backward across the foreground. In the background, an older man with balding grey hair, wearing a yellow patterned sweater over a white shirt and dark trousers, stands holding a young woman. The young woman is dressed in a bathrobe and has a white towel wrapped around her head. To the left, partially obscured, a young child wearing a patterned outfit is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a cozy, rustic living room, featuring wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace that create a warm, inviting atmosphere. A soft, orange glow from a floor lamp illuminates the room, complementing the earthy tones of the decor. A comfortable sofa with a plaid blanket and a wooden coffee table add to the homely feel. However, the focus shifts to the characters' anxious departure, as they interact dynamically within the space, enhancing the lively yet tense ambiance. The overall setting suggests a casual, lived-in environment, with a focus on the natural textures, warm lighting, and the characters' hurried exit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
