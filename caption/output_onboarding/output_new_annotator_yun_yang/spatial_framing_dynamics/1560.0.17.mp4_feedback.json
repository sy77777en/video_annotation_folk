    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a young man walking through a snowy park. Initially, the man is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the foreground, moving towards the right side of the frame. As he progresses, his position shifts closer to the center, maintaining a consistent distance from the camera. The man remains in the foreground throughout the video, while the background features a row of hedges and leafless trees lining the path. Two individuals dressed in dark clothing are seated on a bench located in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The buildings with arched doorways are situated in the background, spanning the width of the scene. The camera maintains a steady height at the subject's level, ensuring the man and surrounding elements remain clearly visible. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, keeping the spatial composition stable and focused on the man's movement across the snowy path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man walking through a snowy park. He has light skin and dark hair, and he is wearing a brown jacket, blue jeans, and brown shoes. He carries a backpack over both shoulders. The man is walking along a path lined with leafless trees and a hedge. In the background, there are two people sitting on a bench, dressed in dark clothing, who appear to be engaged in conversation. The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene in a park-like setting, featuring snow-covered ground and bare trees with a light dusting of snow on their branches. The environment includes a row of hedges and a series of buildings in the background, constructed from light-colored stone, featuring arched windows and doors. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. A few benches are placed along a path, and the snow adds a uniform white layer across the landscape. The scene is calm, with minimal movement, as one individual walks along the path, dressed in winter clothing, while in the background, two people are seated on a bench, engaged in conversation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
