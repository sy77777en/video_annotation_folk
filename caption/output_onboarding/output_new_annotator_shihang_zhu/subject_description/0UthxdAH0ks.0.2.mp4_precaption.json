    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot within a large, industrial-style pig barn. The camera looks down a long, central aisle flanked by rows upon rows of metal pens containing pigs. The structure features a high, arched ceiling with visible support beams, creating a sense of vast, repetitive space. There is no main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on the environment itself\u2014its scale, uniformity, and the somewhat bleak atmosphere created by the dim lighting and the confinement of the animals. The lone figure walking down the aisle is small within the expansive frame, serving primarily to establish the scale of the barn rather than acting as a central point of interest, thereby emphasizing the setting over any individual character or object.",
