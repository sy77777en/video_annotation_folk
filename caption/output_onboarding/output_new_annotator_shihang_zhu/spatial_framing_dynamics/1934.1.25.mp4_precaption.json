    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person clad entirely in a white, form-fitting bodysuit, standing with their back towards the camera. This individual is positioned centrally near the bottom edge of the frame and appears relatively small. They are facing a large screen that dominates the background. Displayed on this screen is a close-up shot of a woman's face. The woman has dark hair, visible beneath a white head covering topped with white goggles. She is wearing a white garment featuring red stripes around the collar and shoulders, and her facial expression appears concerned or displeased.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting dominated by a large screen displaying a close-up color image of a woman's face. The woman on the screen has dark hair and wears protective clothing, including a white head covering with goggles pushed up, and a white garment featuring red trim around the collar. Positioned centrally in the foreground on a dark, flat surface stands a small, humanoid figure wearing a plain, light-colored full-body suit, facing the screen with its back towards the viewer.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a person dressed in white standing with their back to the camera in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman\u2019s face.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is framed as a wide shot. In the foreground, a person clad in white stands centrally near the bottom edge of the frame, facing away from the camera. This figure is positioned before a large screen that occupies the background and nearly fills the entire frame. The screen displays a close-up image of a woman's face, which is centered within the screen's display area. The camera remains static and positioned at the level of the foreground subject throughout the clip.",
