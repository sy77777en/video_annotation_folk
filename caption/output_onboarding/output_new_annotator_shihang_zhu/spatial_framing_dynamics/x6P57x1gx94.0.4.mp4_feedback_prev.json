    "pre_caption": "This wide shot initially frames the skateboarder in the bottom left foreground. He moves diagonally across the frame towards the center right, ascending a sloped concrete structure that occupies the right foreground and middle ground. In the left middle ground, a man and woman walk away from the camera. Further back, in the center middle ground, stand a woman and two men near a patch of grass. A building forms the background. The camera maintains a static position at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a young man skateboarding towards a set of stairs with a metal handrail. He is wearing a black beanie with white text, a white t-shirt with a yellow graphic over a black long-sleeved shirt, and brown pants. As he reaches the stairs, he positions himself to maintain his balance rather than interact with the handrail. In the background, several pedestrians are visible. On the left, a man wearing a dark jacket, blue jeans, and a light blue face mask walks beside a woman with long, light-colored hair wearing a long beige coat and white pants; they are walking away from the camera. Further back and more centrally located, a woman wearing a red beanie and dark clothing stands near two older men. One of these older men wears a dark jacket, grey pants, and glasses, while the other wears a dark jacket over a striped shirt; both are standing and observing the surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. It features a grey paved walkway adjacent to a small patch of green grass and a modern building with a light-colored facade and large windows in the background. A prominent grey concrete structure with stairs and a ledge, fitted with a black metal handrail, occupies the right side of the view. Several pedestrians are visible in the background area. A person on a skateboard swiftly moves along the walkway, glides onto the slope, and reaches the top of the concrete structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
