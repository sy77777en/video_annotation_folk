    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the night-vision video, a man stands in what appears to be a recording studio. He has dark hair, possibly styled in dreadlocks or braids, partially covered by a patterned bandana. He also has a beard and mustache. He wears a dark t-shirt underneath a lighter-toned, unbuttoned jacket or overshirt. Initially facing a computer monitor, he turns towards the camera, raises his right index finger upwards, and then points it towards his temple while appearing to speak or rap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, likely in a dimly lit room with a focus on electronic equipment, suggesting a studio or control room setting. A person is centrally positioned in the frame, playing a crucial role in the scene's composition. The environment is characterized by a dark ambiance, with greenish night vision tones dominating the scene. Notable visual elements include electronic devices with glowing screens and speakers, adding to the technical atmosphere. The walls are dark, enhancing the low-light conditions. The setting remains consistent throughout, with no significant changes in lighting or environment, maintaining a steady, subdued mood.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing the man from the waist up. He occupies the center of the frame and the middle ground. Initially, he faces towards the left side of the frame, looking at a computer monitor positioned in the left middle ground. A speaker is visible in the bottom left foreground, while another speaker and a microphone stand are situated in the right middle ground. The man then turns to face the camera directly. Concurrently, the framing tightens to a medium close-up, showing him from the chest up. He remains in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with the computer monitor now visible to his left. Throughout the shot, the camera stays at the subject's level.",
