    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a cluttered kitchen counter under dim lighting. Prominently featured are a black drip coffee maker with an illuminated power light and a glass carafe, positioned next to a black toaster oven. Behind these appliances, a window with a pre-existing hole and three white pill bottles resting on the sill is visible. The counter surface is messy, holding a partially eaten orange bell pepper, a crumpled white plastic bag containing green stalks, a slice of toast, scattered crumbs, and a crumpled cloth near some kitchen utensils on the far left. During the video, an egg unexpectedly hits the window, causing a splash and scattering white, powdery residue across the broken pane.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a dimly lit indoor scene focused on a cluttered kitchen counter next to a window. Sunlight streams through the dirty windowpane, highlighting several white pill bottles resting on the sill. Positioned on the gray counter are a black drip coffee maker, its power light illuminated, and a black mesh-basket toaster oven. The counter surface is messy, scattered with items including a piece of toast, crumbs, a cut orange bell pepper, and a crumpled plastic bag containing vegetable scraps. Part of a sink area with utensils is visible to the left against a white tiled backsplash. In the middle of the video, an egg suddenly splatters against the exterior of the window glass, creating a splash.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video uses a full shot to frame a cluttered kitchen counter. In the middle ground, a coffee maker is positioned center-left, adjacent to a toaster oven located center-right. Behind these appliances, occupying the background and the upper portion of the frame, is a window with three pill bottles resting on its sill in the top right. The foreground displays various items scattered across the counter: kitchen utensils and a cloth are on the left, a slice of toast and crumbs are near the bottom left and center, a cut orange bell pepper sits center-right, and a crumpled plastic bag is on the right. Part of a sink area is visible on the far left, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, set against a tiled backsplash in the background. During the shot, an egg strikes the window glass (background, center-right), creating a splash and leaving residue. The camera remains static and is positioned at the level of the subjects on the counter.",
