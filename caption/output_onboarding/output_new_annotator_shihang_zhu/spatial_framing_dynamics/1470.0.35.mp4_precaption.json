    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a kitchen scene with multiple individuals. Initially, a woman with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white checkered dress, is present near a yellow door. Then, a man with dark hair, dressed in a mustard yellow sweater over a white collared shirt, enters through the door while embracing a second woman who wears a white textured robe and a pink head covering. They are followed by a third woman with short dark hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark tie, and holding a book. Towards the end, after the first woman opens the door, a girl enters the room.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene inside a brightly lit kitchen during the day. The room features light-colored patterned wallpaper above white wainscoting and trim. A prominent bright yellow interior door with a black doorknob is visible, alongside a white built-in cabinet or secondary door. To the right, a large, white vintage-style refrigerator stands near a vase holding blue and yellow flowers. Part of a round wooden table and a chair occupy the lower left corner. Throughout the video, several people enter through the yellow doorway and interact within the kitchen space near the refrigerator. Towards the end of the video, a woman in a red dress with short brown hair and a man in a blue shirt with glasses are seen chatting near the refrigerator, while a child in a striped t-shirt plays with a toy car on the floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot, filmed at subject level. Initially, a woman in a checkered dress occupies the center-right middle ground, facing a yellow door positioned in the center middle ground. A refrigerator stands in the right foreground/middle ground, with part of a table visible in the bottom left foreground. The woman moves slightly right towards the refrigerator as the door opens. A man embracing a woman in a robe enters through the doorway, moving from the center to the center-right middle ground. They are followed by a third woman in a white shirt and tie, who also enters through the center middle ground door and moves slightly right. The final composition shows the entering group clustered in the center-right middle ground, with the first woman now standing further right, closer to the refrigerator in the middle ground.",
