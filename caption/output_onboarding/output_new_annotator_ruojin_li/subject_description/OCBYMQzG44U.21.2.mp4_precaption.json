    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot that follows a slow progression through a long, eerie corridor. The space is characterized by its repeating arched entryways and walls covered in small, sickly yellow-green tiles, all bathed in a dim, hazy light. A single, circular sconce glows on the right-hand wall, while a brighter light source is visible at the far end of the tunnel, suggesting a distant exit or another room. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the unsettling, liminal atmosphere created by the repetitive architecture and monochromatic color scheme. The camera's movement through the environment emphasizes the feeling of being lost or exploring an anonymous, seemingly endless space.",
