    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four men are playing with water balloons outdoors. On the right, a man wearing a blue t-shirt and a backward red baseball cap holds a silver knife, popping a red water balloon and causing water to spray. To his left, a man with a beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a black graphic design and dark shorts, raises his arms after tossing an orange water balloon high into the air. Next to him, a man with glasses, wearing a plain white t-shirt and dark shorts, has just thrown a purple water balloon high into the air. On the far left, a man with a dark beard and hair, wearing a light gray t-shirt and dark shorts, reaches forward after tossing a red water balloon, which was pierced by the man on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit outdoor setting, four men are gathered on a paved surface against a backdrop of dense green trees. One man, wearing a red cap, uses a silver knife to pierce a low-flying red water balloon thrown by another. Meanwhile, two other men throw orange and purple balloons, which are still in the air, as they all enjoy the activity dressed in casual shorts and t-shirts.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium full shot captures four men on a paved surface, framed against a background of green trees. Initially, a man in a grey shirt is on the left foreground, extending a red water balloon toward a man in a blue shirt and red cap on the right foreground, who holds a knife. Positioned in the middle ground between them are two other men in white shirts. As the video progresses, the two men in the middle ground throw their water balloons, one purple and one orange, upward, which travel toward the top center of the frame. Simultaneously, the man on the right pops the red water balloon with the knife, creating a spray of water in the center of the frame. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
