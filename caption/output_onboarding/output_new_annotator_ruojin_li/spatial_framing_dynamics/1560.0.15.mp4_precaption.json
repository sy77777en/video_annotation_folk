    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban scenery shot of a modern, empty subway station, captured from a dramatically tilted, almost vertical perspective. The focus is on the architectural environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, with the unusual camera angle emphasizing the station's long, clean lines and sense of depth. The scene is defined by sleek surfaces and a striking color palette of deep blues and bright yellows from the overhead lighting, which casts long, streaked reflections along the walls. A digital display screen shows an analog clock, the platform number \"Gleis 1,\" an SOS button, and a public health message in German, adding a layer of specific detail to the otherwise minimalist and futuristic space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A rotating, dynamic shot moves along a modern, underground subway platform. The scene features a clean, light-colored platform floor with a tactile paving strip, contrasted by dark train tracks in an adjacent tunnel. The station is illuminated by bright white lights, with striking blue accent lighting along the walls. Overhead, a series of yellow, orange, and blue circular lampshades form a large, curved structure, casting a warm yellow light onto the ground. The ceiling casts a blue light that extends to the side walls. A prominent digital sign displays an analog clock, the platform number \"Gleis 1,\" an \"SOS\" symbol, and German text. The overall aesthetic is clean and contemporary, with smooth surfaces and a distinct color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a subway station, captured from a high-angle, dramatically tilted perspective. Initially, the frame is oriented almost vertically, with the platform extending from the top to the bottom along the left side and the train tracks in the bottom left foreground. A large, curved, yellow and blue light fixture occupies the top right, while the tunnel recedes into the background. The camera then rotates counter-clockwise, shifting the composition. As it turns, a digital display screen, initially in the middle ground, moves to the top left of the frame. The platform shifts to occupy the bottom right, with the blue-lit tunnel wall now on the left and the tracks in the top right background. The camera is positioned high above the platform.",
