    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, blonde hair and a light complexion is featured in a grassy field. She is wearing a white two-piece outfit, which includes a strapless bandeau top and long, loose-fitting pants, complemented by white sneakers. Initially, she is standing still. She then begins to run, first moving towards the low-angle camera, which makes her appear larger until her head is out of the frame, showing only her body from the neck down. Subsequently, she runs away from the camera, turns around, and appears smaller in the wide shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the scene unfolds in a vast, flat green meadow at dusk. The meadow is bordered by a tall, dense cornfield on one side and a dark pine forest on the other. In the distance, a mountain range is silhouetted against the pale evening sky. A woman in a white outfit runs through the long, lush grass, and the camera follows her movement, staying low to the ground. Yellow subtitles appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen, displaying words like \"yes\" and \"that's it\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a woman in a white dress running on an outdoor grassy field. Initially, the frame shows a wide shot. As she gets closer, she becomes larger in the frame, with her head exiting the frame, leaving only her body below the head visible. Then, as she moves away from the camera, the shot returns to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle wide shot, positioning a woman in the middle ground, slightly right of center. A vast green meadow occupies the foreground and middle ground, bordered by a tall cornfield in the middle ground and a pine forest in the right background. A mountain range is visible in the far-left background. The woman runs toward the camera, causing her to grow larger in the frame until the shot becomes a medium view of her body from the neck down as she passes over the camera. The camera then follows her as she runs away, moving from the foreground toward the top-left of the frame. As she moves into the middle ground, the shot transitions back to a wide shot, showing her becoming smaller within the expansive landscape.",
