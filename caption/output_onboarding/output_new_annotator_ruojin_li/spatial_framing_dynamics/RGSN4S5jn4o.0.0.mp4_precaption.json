    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young Black man wearing a light green shirt, blue jeans, tan boots, and a black backpack walks across a crosswalk. In the background, a yellow taxi drives down the street, and another man rides a bicycle. The crosswalk's surface transforms from a black and white checkerboard pattern into a complex design of white abstract lines and shapes on the dark asphalt. On the left sidewalk, a man in a yellow jacket and a beanie walks near a flower stand. As the camera pans left, the man in the yellow jacket and a woman with pink hair, initially appearing as live-action characters, transform into animated figures. The woman, now cartoon-style, wears a green jacket and yellow pants while holding a small pink creature, walking toward the viewer. She is followed by a man in a dark suit, who remains a live-action character. A user interface element showing different brush styles is visible in the upper right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves forward along an urban street during the day. The scene features multi-story buildings, one with a vertical garden, lining a paved road where a yellow taxi is visible. A crosswalk on the asphalt transforms from a black and white checkerboard pattern into an intricate design of abstract white lines. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, where a flower stand and a red postbox are located at the corner near the intersection. Various graphic overlays appear throughout the video, including stylized white icons, an animated character drawn over a pedestrian, and a user interface box labeled \"Brushes\" in the upper right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a wide shot at the subject's level. Initially, a man walks from the right middle ground across a checkerboard-patterned crosswalk that occupies the foreground. In the right middle ground, another man rides a bicycle, while a yellow taxi is visible in the background. On the left sidewalk, in the middle ground, a man in a yellow jacket walks away from the camera near a flower stand. As the camera pans left, the crosswalk's surface transforms into an abstract white line pattern. A woman, initially in the left middle ground, walks toward the camera into the foreground and transforms into an animated character, as does the man in the yellow jacket behind her. A live-action man in a suit follows the animated woman in the middle ground, and a user interface element appears in the top right corner.",
