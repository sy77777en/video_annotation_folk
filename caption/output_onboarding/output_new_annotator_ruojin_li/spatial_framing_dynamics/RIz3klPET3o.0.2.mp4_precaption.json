    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, simply rendered black stick figure character, distinguished by its vibrant scarf, is depicted riding a sled in a stick figure style. The scene features several hand-drawn black lines forming a path with various slopes and ledges, along which the character progresses. Additionally, the scene includes several isolated, hand-drawn black markings, such as a greater-than sign, a symbol resembling a musical notation mark, the number \"10,\" and the letter \"P.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, a minimalist, hand-drawn scene is presented against a plain white background. The black lines form a segmented path for a small figure on a bicycle, featuring steps and curved sections with upward and downward arcs. This creates a rugged, undulating track with various ups and downs, guiding the character on their journey. The environment is sparsely decorated with other black, hand-drawn elements, including the letter 'P', the number '10', and various abstract symbols resembling musical notations.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a minimalist, hand-drawn scene from a high-angle, side-on perspective. Initially, a small stick figure on a sled is positioned on a ledge in the top center-right. A long, undulating line forms a path leading to this ledge from the left side of the frame. After the character falls off the ledge, the scene transitions, and the character reappears at the bottom center, now on a curved section of a new path. In this new position, the number \"10\" is located to the character's left, and the letter \"P\" is above and to the right. The character then moves along this curved path toward the bottom right of the frame. Other abstract, hand-drawn symbols are scattered in the middle ground on the right side.",
