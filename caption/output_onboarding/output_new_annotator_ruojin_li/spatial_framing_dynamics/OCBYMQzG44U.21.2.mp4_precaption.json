    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot that follows a slow progression through a long, eerie corridor. The space is characterized by its repeating arched entryways and walls covered in small, sickly yellow-green tiles, all bathed in a dim, hazy light. Circular sconces glow on both sides of the corridor, while a brighter light source is visible at the far end of the tunnel, suggesting a distant exit or another room. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the unsettling, liminal atmosphere created by the repetitive architecture and monochromatic color scheme. The camera's movement through the environment emphasizes the feeling of being lost or exploring an anonymous, seemingly endless space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves forward through a long, hazy corridor with a distinct greenish-yellow hue. The walls, floor, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, square tiles. The hallway is defined by a series of repeating arches that recede into the distance, creating a tunnel-like effect. Round wall lamps are mounted on both sides of the corridor, while a brighter light source is visible at the far end of the passage.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective. Initially, the frame is dominated by a tiled wall with a glowing circular light in the right foreground. A series of repeating arched doorways occupies the center and left of the frame, receding into the hazy background. The camera moves forward at eye level, proceeding down the corridor. As it advances, the light on the right wall moves out of the frame, and the camera passes through the first archway. This movement brings a brighter light source, located at the far end of the corridor in the background, into a more central position, revealing a staircase in the distance.",
