    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person dressed in white, standing with their back to the camera, facing a large screen that nearly fills the entire frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman's face with short black hair and white goggles on her head. Her brows are furrowed, and she has a slightly troubled expression as she sighs and presses her lips together, her gaze fixed directly on the person in white. The figure in white appears small compared to the massive screen, emphasizing the scale and prominence of the woman's face on the display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a large screen displaying a close-up of a person's face. The person on the screen wears a white outfit with red stripes and goggles on their head. In front of the screen, a figure dressed in a white suit stands, facing the screen. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the interaction between the figure and the screen. The lighting is even, highlighting the details of the screen and the figure's silhouette. The scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, emphasizing the stark contrast between the large face on the screen and the small figure in front.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a person dressed in white standing with their back to the camera in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman\u2019s face.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot where a person in a white outfit stands with their back to the camera, positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. This individual is small in comparison to the large screen behind them, which dominates the background and occupies most of the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman's face, centered within the screen and thus in the middle of the overall frame. The woman's face is static, filling the screen from top to bottom and side to side. There are no noticeable changes in the shot size or the spatial position of the subjects throughout the sequence. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The scene is static, with no movement or transition in the spatial arrangement of the elements. The person in white and the screen with the woman's face remain in their respective positions, creating a clear contrast between the small figure in the foreground and the large image in the background.",
