    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the subjects, capturing the entire figure and its surroundings. The animated silhouette of the humanoid figure is initially centered in the frame, moving from the left towards the right. It occupies the middle ground, with its 2D position shifting horizontally across the screen. The camera remains at the subject's height, maintaining a consistent side-view perspective. Sparse green grass tufts appear in the foreground, scattered along the bottom of the frame. As the figure progresses, an open brown briefcase with a red interior enters the frame from the right, settling in the foreground near the bottom right corner. The briefcase remains stationary while the figure continues its movement, passing by it. The stark white background fills the rest of the scene, providing a minimalist setting. There are no changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black silhouette of a humanoid figure with a round head and simplified body structure, walking from left to right. The figure has no discernible facial features or clothing details. In the latter part of the video, the figure encounters an open briefcase on the ground, which is brown with a red interior and contains white papers. The briefcase is positioned to the right of the figure, and a few small green grass tufts are visible on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a gaming scene with a side-view perspective of a character. The setting is outdoors, featuring a minimalist environment with a stark white background and a simple, flat ground. Sparse green grass tufts are scattered along the ground, adding minimal color contrast. The character, depicted as a solid black silhouette, moves across the scene, emphasizing motion. As the character approaches a notable element\u2014a brown briefcase with a red interior lying open on the ground\u2014he subtly lowers his head to look down at it, adding a point of interaction. The overall style is simplistic and monochromatic, focusing on the character's movement and interaction with the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
