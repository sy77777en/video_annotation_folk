    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a Black man wearing a light green shirt, jeans, and a backpack as he crosses the street, while a cyclist approaches him. As the camera pans left, it reveals a woman with pink hair walking toward a man. She is wearing a long green dress with floral patterns and is holding a small animated animal in her arms. Nearby, a man in a suit with short black hair and a beard stands on the sidewalk, dressed in a dark suit, white shirt, and tie. Both the woman with pink hair and the person crossing the street transition from a realistic style to an animated style. In the background, a yellow taxi is visible on the road, and a bicycle with a basket of flowers is parked on the sidewalk. The street features a distinctive black and white checkered pattern, adding to the scene's unique visual blend of real and animated elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set in an urban outdoor environment. The scene unfolds on a city street lined with modern buildings featuring large windows and varied facades. The time of day appears to be daytime, with clear visibility and no notable weather conditions. The street is marked with a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern at a crosswalk, adding a unique visual element. A yellow taxi is visible on the road, contributing to the urban setting. \n\nIn the scene, there are animated characters integrated into the real-world environment, adding a surreal touch. One character is dressed in a green outfit, while another wears casual attire. These characters are stylized with bold colors and simple shapes, contrasting with the realistic backdrop. \n\nOverlay elements include a menu on the right side of the screen labeled \"Brushes,\" with various icons and options, suggesting an interactive or augmented reality experience. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but enhance the viewer's engagement with the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a Black man in a light green shirt, jeans, and a backpack crossing the street from the right to the left of the frame, positioned in the foreground. A cyclist approaches from the background, moving towards the center. As the camera pans left, the shot transitions to a full shot, revealing a woman with pink hair in a long green dress with floral patterns, holding a small animated animal. She is positioned in the center-left of the frame, moving towards a man in a suit who stands on the sidewalk in the middle ground. The man in the suit is located slightly to the right of the center. In the background, a yellow taxi is visible on the road, and a bicycle with a basket of flowers is parked on the left sidewalk. The street features a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern. The camera remains at the subjects' height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective as the scene transitions from realistic to animated styles.",
