    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing multiple subjects in a domestic setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame. She moves slightly towards the center. As the video progresses, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress enters from the left, partially turning away and moving into the middle ground. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants then appears in the foreground on the left, engaging with the other subjects. A child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat joins near the center, interacting with the adults. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout. In the background, a yellow door opens, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, standing further back in the scene. The large, cream-colored refrigerator occupies the right side of the frame in the foreground, while a wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left in the middle ground. The vase with blue and yellow flowers sits on a countertop in the background, near the center-right. The camera maintains a consistent perspective, focusing on the interactions among the group without significant changes in shot size or position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a middle-aged woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress, positioned near a refrigerator. She appears startled upon noticing a child outside the door. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen with his left hand on the waist of a woman in a pink headscarf and light-colored dress, entering the house with his back to the camera. The child, dressed in a colorful patterned outfit and red hat, is facing the middle-aged woman and has their right hand resting on the table's surface. The woman in the pink headscarf is turned away from the camera, guiding the child into the house. In the background, as the woman with short blonde hair opens the door, a girl with reddish-brown hair, wearing a white shirt and tie, is revealed spinning in mid-air. The scene suggests a lively interaction among the group in a domestic setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a bright, vintage-style kitchen with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door, which, when opened, reveals another door frame in the distance, adding depth to the scene. Patterned wallpaper enhances the retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
