    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a cluttered kitchen countertop, capturing all elements within the scene. The black coffee maker is centrally positioned in the middle ground, slightly towards the left side of the frame. Surrounding it, various items are scattered across the counter, including a sliced orange bell pepper in the foreground near the center-right, a plastic bag also in the foreground on the right, and a thick slice of bread in the middle ground on the left. A bottle and a few small containers are placed on the window sill in the background, located at the top center of the frame. The window itself is situated in the upper middle part of the scene, allowing soft natural light to enter. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at the subject's level. There are no noticeable changes in shot size, position, or camera movement, preserving the static and detailed view of the kitchen environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a cluttered kitchen countertop with various items. A black coffee maker is positioned prominently, surrounded by a disorganized array of objects. On the counter, there is a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and a piece of burnt toast. Additionally, a bottle and a few small containers are visible, suggesting a mix of food preparation and storage items. A faucet and a sink are also featured on the countertop. The scene conveys a sense of everyday kitchen activity with items left out in a casual, unarranged manner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a dimly lit kitchen setting, characterized by a cluttered countertop with various items such as a coffee maker, a sliced bell pepper, and scattered food remnants. A small window above the counter allows soft, natural light to filter in, highlighting dust particles in the air. An egg has been thrown against the window, resulting in it cracking open. The window sill holds several small containers, possibly spice jars or medicine bottles. The countertop also features a sink and a faucet. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, early morning or late afternoon, with a sense of stillness and neglect. The scene remains consistent throughout, emphasizing the untidy and lived-in nature of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
