    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a city street, capturing a man in a light green shirt and jeans crossing the sidewalk. He is positioned in the center of the frame, in the foreground, with the checkerboard pattern of the street beneath him. As he moves, the pattern transforms into lines and squiggles. The camera then shifts to a full shot, focusing on two animated characters on the opposite side of the street. The animated woman with pink hair and a green dress is positioned on the left, while the animated person in a pink jacket is on the right, both in the foreground. A yellow taxi is visible in the background, positioned to the right. The camera remains at the subjects' height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. Overlay elements, such as a menu with brush options, appear on the right side of the frame, indicating a digital interface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a city street scene, initially focusing on a man crossing the sidewalk. He is dressed in a light green shirt and jeans, with short dark hair and no beard. The street features a checkerboard pattern, which transforms into an irregular design of lines and squiggles as the man crosses. The camera then shifts to two individuals on the opposite side of the street. One is an animated woman with pink hair, wearing a long green dress adorned with a flower design. The other is an animated person wearing a pink jacket and holding a phone. Both animated characters have a stylized, cartoonish appearance, contrasting with the realistic setting. A yellow taxi is visible on the road, and colorful flowers are displayed on the sidewalk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a first-person POV shot of a pedestrian crossing an urban street during the day. The scene is outdoors, featuring a typical city street with commercial buildings. The pedestrian crossing is marked with a distinctive pattern that transforms from a checkerboard into unique lines and squiggles, enhancing the creative and whimsical atmosphere. A yellow taxi is visible on the road, adding to the urban vibe. The sidewalk hosts a flower stand with vibrant blooms, and a few pedestrians contribute to the lively city environment. Animated characters are integrated into the scene, further adding to its whimsical nature. Overlay elements include a menu with brush options and icons on the right side, indicating a digital interface or augmented reality feature. The weather is cloudy or overcast, setting a subdued tone.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
