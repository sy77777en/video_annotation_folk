    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a white outfit, standing with their back to the camera. This person is positioned centrally in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman's face. The woman has short, dark hair and is wearing white goggles on her head. Her expression appears to be a frown, as if she is looking at the person in white with a sense of disapproval or concern. The person in white appears small in comparison to the large screen, emphasizing the woman's face as the dominant visual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting dominated by a large screen displaying a close-up of a woman's face. The woman on the screen wears a white outfit with red stripes and goggles on her head. In front of the screen, a figure dressed in a white suit stands, facing the screen. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the interaction between the figure and the screen. The lighting is even, suggesting a controlled indoor environment. The screen's background colors are light green and purple, contributing to the overall color scheme. The scene conveys a sense of scale, with the large screen dwarfing the figure standing before it.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a person dressed in white standing with their back to the camera in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman\u2019s face.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a wide shot featuring a person in a white outfit standing with their back to the camera, positioned centrally in the foreground. This individual occupies a relatively small portion of the frame compared to the large screen behind them. The screen, which dominates the background, displays a close-up of a woman's face, filling most of the frame from top to bottom and left to right. The woman's face is centered on the screen, creating a strong focal point. The person in white stands directly in front of the screen, maintaining a consistent distance throughout the sequence. There are no noticeable changes in the shot size or the spatial position of the subjects. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the scene without any evident movement or shift in perspective. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the contrast in scale between the small figure in the foreground and the large, detailed image on the screen in the background.",
