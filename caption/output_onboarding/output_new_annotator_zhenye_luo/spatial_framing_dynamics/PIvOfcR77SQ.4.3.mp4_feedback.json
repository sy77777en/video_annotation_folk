    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide-angle view of a snowy landscape, capturing a vast expanse of snow-covered ground and a line of tall, slender coniferous trees in the background. The trees are positioned towards the top right of the frame, forming a dense cluster in the middle ground. The camera then shifts to a first-person perspective, focusing on the operator's hand gripping the steering wheel of a sled-like vehicle. The hand is located in the bottom left of the frame, while the steering wheel occupies the center. The vehicle's front section, featuring a blue logo, is visible in the lower part of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera remains steady, maintaining the same angle and position, emphasizing the operator's control over the vehicle as it moves forward through the snowy terrain. The camera's height is consistent with the operator's eye level, providing a clear view of the path ahead and the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is filmed from a first-person perspective, showing parts of a man's body as he navigates a snowy landscape. In the distance, a stand of tall, slender coniferous trees is visible. The man, dressed in a dark jacket, is operating a sled-like vehicle. The vehicle is black and circular, featuring a prominent blue logo on the front. The scene captures a winter setting, with the man ready to traverse the snowy terrain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set in a snowy outdoor environment. The ground is blanketed in thick, untouched snow, with visible tracks suggesting recent movement. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, indicating a daytime setting. In the foreground, a hand grips the steering wheel of a sled or similar vehicle, hinting at motion through the snowy terrain. The vehicle's metal and plastic components are visible, contrasting with the white snow. In the distance, there appears to be a stand of tall, slender coniferous trees. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, with the natural beauty of the snow and trees dominating the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
