    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot near a refrigerator, features a woman with short blonde hair in a blue and white checkered dress, opening a door. She interacts with a group of people gradually entering the frame with their backs to the camera. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants faces her, while next to him, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress is visible. A child in a red hat and colorful patterned outfit stands between them, facing the woman in the checkered dress. Inside the opening door, another woman with short dark hair, wearing a white top, dark skirt, and black tie, spins around holding a black-covered book in her right hand. The scene suggests a domestic setting with dynamic interaction among the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting with a vintage aesthetic. The room features a yellow door and patterned wallpaper, contributing to a retro atmosphere. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth surface and rounded edges typical of mid-20th-century design. A wooden dining table is partially visible, accompanied by chairs that suggest a cozy, domestic environment. The lighting is natural, indicating daytime, and the overall color palette includes soft yellows and blues. The scene includes several people interacting, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of multiple subjects in a domestic kitchen setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the center-left of the frame, near a yellow door. She is in the foreground, interacting with others who enter from behind. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants appears on the left side of the frame, facing her. Next to him, slightly to the right, is a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress. A child in a red hat and colorful outfit stands between them, also facing the woman in the checkered dress. These individuals are all in the foreground. As the scene progresses, another woman with short dark hair, wearing a white top, dark skirt, and black tie, enters through the yellow door in the background. She is initially in the background but moves closer to the center as she spins around holding a black-covered book. The large, cream-colored refrigerator occupies the right side of the frame, in the middle ground. The wooden dining table is partially visible in the bottom left corner, also in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, capturing their interactions without significant changes in shot size or position.",
