    "pre_caption": "This is an interior architectural scenery shot. The video presents a view from above, looking down onto a tiled floor and a body of greenish water. A white spiral staircase with a simple metal railing curves upwards from a cylindrical base partially submerged in the water. White columns are also visible near the water's edge. There is no main subject because the focus is on the environment itself, emphasizing the clean lines, geometric forms, and the somewhat sterile, liminal atmosphere of the architectural space, rather than a specific object or entity. A small, indistinct orange object is briefly visible near the edge of the water, but it is not the focal point and serves only as a minor detail within the larger composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
