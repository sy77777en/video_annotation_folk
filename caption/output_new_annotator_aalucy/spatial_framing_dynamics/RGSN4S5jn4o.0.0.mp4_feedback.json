    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot capturing the entire street scene. Initially, a man in a light green top and blue pants is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, crossing the street. He moves from the right towards the left. The camera remains at his level, maintaining a consistent perspective. As he exits the frame, the camera pans left, transitioning to a full shot that includes more of the street and additional subjects. Two pedestrians appear on the left side of the frame in the middle ground; they gradually transform into animated figures. One is a woman with pink hair in a green dress, and the other is a headless figure in a pink coat and blue pants, carrying a red bag. Both are positioned centrally as the camera continues panning. A man in a dark suit walks towards the camera from the background, entering the middle ground. The checkered crosswalk occupies the lower portion of the frame, transitioning to a striped pattern as the camera moves. The yellow taxi is initially in the background on the right, moving away. The camera maintains a steady height, aligned with the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a city street scene blending real and animated elements. A Black man, wearing a bright light green top and blue pants, is seen crossing the street. A yellow taxi is visible nearby. As the camera pans from right to left, two pedestrians on the opposite side of the street gradually transform into animated figures: one is a woman with pink hair, wearing a green dress with a floral design, and the other is a headless figure in a pink coat and blue pants, holding a large red shoulder bag. These animated characters have a stylized, cartoonish look that contrasts with the realistic environment. Additionally, a white man in a dark suit is walking toward the camera. The scene features a checkered crosswalk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set in an urban outdoor environment. The scene unfolds on a city street lined with modern buildings featuring a mix of glass and brick facades. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, indicated by the clear daylight illuminating the area. Notable visual elements include a crosswalk that transitions from a checkered to a striped pattern and a yellow taxi driving along the road. The street is relatively quiet, with a few pedestrians visible. The ground features intricate patterns, adding visual interest to the scene. Overlay elements include animated characters and a digital interface on the right side, displaying options like \"Brushes\" and various icons, suggesting an augmented reality or digital art theme. These overlays are not part of the physical environment but enhance the viewer's experience by adding a creative layer to the urban setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
