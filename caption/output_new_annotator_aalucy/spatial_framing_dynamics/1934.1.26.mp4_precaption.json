    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes running down the sides. They are wearing white hoods that cover their heads, leaving no visible facial features. One individual stands out by wearing a tall, red top hat. Three people are gathered closely around a small, black rectangular screen mounted on a white structure, appearing to be intently observing the screen, with some leaning in and others standing upright. The fourth person is in the background, facing the opposite direction, seemingly recording something. The scene conveys a sense of focused attention on the screen, with the individuals' postures suggesting curiosity or examination.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen embedded in the wall. One person wears a distinctive red top hat, adding a splash of color to the scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, with three focused on the screen, while one person, positioned away from the camera, is looking in a different direction. The lighting is bright and even, emphasizing the stark contrast between the white surroundings and the black screen. The overall atmosphere is clinical and focused.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of four individuals in a minimalist indoor setting. The camera captures the subjects from a frontal perspective, positioned at their level. The four figures are arranged around a central white structure with a black screen. Three individuals are grouped closely in the foreground and middle ground, positioned towards the left and center of the frame. They lean forward, focusing intently on the screen. Their 2D positions are primarily left-center and center, while their 3D positions place them in the foreground and middle ground. The fourth individual, wearing a red top hat, is situated further back in the background, slightly to the right, facing away from the camera. This person's 2D position is top right, and they occupy the background in 3D space. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence. The white structure with the screen remains centrally located in the middle ground, serving as the focal point for the three individuals. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the interaction between the subjects and the screen, with the camera maintaining a steady, level perspective.",
