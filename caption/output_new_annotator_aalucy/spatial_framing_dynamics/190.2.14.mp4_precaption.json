    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two human subjects, a woman and a man, both with light skin tones. The woman has short, dark curly hair and is wearing a dark outfit with a colorful scarf around her neck. Initially, she appears to be looking around before making eye contact with the man. The man has short, dark hair and is dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He also seems to be looking around before engaging in conversation with the woman. The moving background suggests they are on a moving vehicle, and the dim lighting indicates a nighttime setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set outdoors at night, featuring a dimly lit environment with a backdrop of dark foliage. The scene captures two individuals seated on adjacent seats, partially illuminated by a soft light source, which highlights their faces and casts subtle shadows. The background appears to be moving, suggesting that the individuals are on a moving vehicle. The surrounding area is obscured by darkness, with only hints of nearby structures visible, suggesting a quiet, possibly residential setting. The individuals are dressed in dark clothing, with one wearing a patterned scarf, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted scene. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or weather elements affecting the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of two subjects, a woman and a man, occupying most of the frame. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the man is on the right. Both are in the foreground, with the background consisting of dark foliage and faintly visible structures, indicating an outdoor nighttime setting. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence. Initially, the woman looks slightly upward and to the right, then turns her head toward the man. The man, initially looking upward and to the left, gradually turns his head to face the woman. Their movements are subtle, with minimal changes in their positions within the frame. The background remains constant, reinforcing the impression of a stable camera setup focused on capturing the interaction between the two individuals.",
