    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, featuring a black car in the foreground, its body extending from the left towards the center-right of the frame, with its rear angled towards the right; through its rear side window, a roll cage is partially visible within the car's interior. A sun glare is visible in the top left near the car's roof, and the car casts a shadow across the foreground towards the bottom right. The asphalt surface on which the car rests occupies the bottom foreground. To the car's right, a body of water lies in the middle ground, adjacent to a field of reddish-brown grass that stretches from the center-right to the right edge, also in the middle ground. Further into the background, a taller field is discernible, while on the far left background, the eaves of houses are visible. The upper portion of the frame is filled by a partly cloudy sky in the background. The camera maintains a position at the car's level throughout. The framing then transitions to a full shot, causing the car to appear slightly smaller within the frame, thereby showing a little more of its immediate surroundings while its relative position and the arrangement of other elements remain consistent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black two-door coupe, likely a modified sports car, parked on an asphalt surface. The car is viewed from the rear three-quarter perspective, showcasing its sleek, lowered profile. It is equipped with a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-colored wheels with a five-pointed star design and a polished outer lip. Through the tinted rear side window, a portion of an interior roll cage is visible. The car casts a long shadow to its right, indicating a low sun angle, with a bright sun glare visible near the top of the frame. In the background, a body of water is present on the right, bordered by an area of dry, tall, reddish-brown grass, likely a wheat field, under a partly cloudy sky. Behind this field, a taller field, possibly a wheat field, is visible. On the left side of the frame, behind the tall, reddish-brown wheat field, there are some houses visible, with only the eaves in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a black coupe parked outdoors on a paved surface next to a body of water. The time of day is late afternoon or early evening, with the sun low in the sky, casting long shadows and creating a warm, hazy light through partly cloudy skies. The car features a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-grey, star-shaped wheels with polished rims; a roll cage is visible through the windows. Behind the creek, there is a layer of shorter, reddish-brown wheat fields, and further back, a taller layer of wheat or vegetation. On the far left side of the frame, only the rooftops of some houses and utility poles are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
