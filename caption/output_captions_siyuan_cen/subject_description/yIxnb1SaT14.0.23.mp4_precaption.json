    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, showcasing a grand, white, multi-domed basilica at night, viewed from a low angle looking up a wide stone staircase. The basilica is brilliantly illuminated, standing out against a dark, cloudy sky, with trees framing the scene on either side of the stairs. While numerous indistinct human figures are present on the staircase and in front of the building, they are small in scale, serving to emphasize the structure's immensity rather than acting as a central subject. The focus is thus on the majestic architecture and the nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the environment and scale over any specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
