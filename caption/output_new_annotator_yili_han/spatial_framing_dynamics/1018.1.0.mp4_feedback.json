    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man standing inside a train compartment. Initially, he is positioned near the center of the frame, with his upper body and part of his lower body visible. The man is seen interacting with the environment, moving his arms and hands towards the window frame. As the video progresses, he leans forward, placing his arms on the window ledge, which brings him closer to the foreground. His position shifts slightly to the left side of the frame while maintaining his central prominence. The background remains consistent, featuring a green and white interior with maps and communication equipment on the walls. The camera maintains a steady height at the subject's level throughout the sequence, capturing the man's actions and the detailed interior of the train compartment. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's movement from a more upright stance to a leaning posture, emphasizing his interaction with the window and the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a green cap with a black rim and red decorative patterns. He has a mustache and is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark navy vest with green and red trim, and matching green pants. The scene is shot from outside the train's window, revealing a train with a blue exterior. Inside, the setting resembles an office with a predominantly green tone, featuring a green notice board, maps, and documents on the wall. Initially, he has his hands on his hips, then looks left and right, hangs up the phone, and closes the window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts the interior of a vintage train compartment with a green and white color scheme. The setting is indoors, featuring a small, enclosed space with a window that frames the scene. The walls are adorned with maps and communication equipment, suggesting a functional environment. The lighting is consistent, indicating daytime. Notable elements include a uniformed individual positioned centrally, wearing a green and red cap and a vest, contributing to the train's retro aesthetic. The compartment's design includes metallic and wooden textures, with visible rivets and panels, enhancing the vintage feel. The scene remains static, focusing on the detailed interior and the individual within this confined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
