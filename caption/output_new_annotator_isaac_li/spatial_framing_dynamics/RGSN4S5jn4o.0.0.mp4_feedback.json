    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a city street scene, showcasing a checkered crosswalk in the foreground. A man with dark skin tone, wearing a green jacket and blue jeans, walks across the crosswalk from the right side towards the left, occupying the middle ground. As he moves, the camera follows him, transitioning to a full shot. The checkered crosswalk shifts to a maze-like pattern in the foreground, altering the visual texture. In the background, a yellow taxi drives along the road, positioned slightly to the right. On the far left, another pedestrian walks away from the camera, while a man in a suit stands near a flower stand filled with colorful flowers, located in the middle ground on the left. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout. As the video progresses, animated overlays appear, transforming some figures into cartoon characters. One figure transitions into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket and blue pants, positioned in the foreground. Another woman with pink hair becomes a pink cartoon character, also in the foreground. These transformations occur dynamically, blending real and mixed reality elements. The scene maintains a consistent urban atmosphere with modern buildings lining the street, and overlay elements such as text and icons related to digital brushes remain in the upper right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a city street scene with a checkered crosswalk. A yellow taxi is visible in the distance, driving along the road. On the right, a man with medium skin tone is walking, wearing a green jacket, blue jeans, and carrying a backpack. Around the midpoint of the video, following a leftward camera pan, human characters transform into animated figures. One is a woman with pink skin, wearing a green dress and holding a flower. Another is a person with a pink head and blue pants, seemingly headless, holding a jacket. A man in a suit with a white shirt and tie stands near a flower stand, which is filled with colorful flowers. The scene blends real and animated elements, creating a dynamic visual contrast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a city street lined with modern buildings of varying colors, including beige, red, and blue facades. The street is marked with a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern at a crosswalk. A yellow taxi is visible on the road, adding a touch of movement to the scene. Sidewalks are adorned with flower stands, and a few pedestrians are present, contributing to the urban atmosphere. Notably, the video includes animated characters integrated into the scene, adding a whimsical element. These characters are colorful, with one wearing a green outfit and another in casual attire. Overlay elements are present, including text and icons related to digital brushes, positioned in the upper right corner, indicating a creative or augmented reality aspect.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
