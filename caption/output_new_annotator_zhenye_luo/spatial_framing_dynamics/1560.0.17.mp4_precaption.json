    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a young man with light skin and short, brown hair walks straight forward on a snow-covered path. He is wearing a tan jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, blue jeans, and brown shoes, and is carrying a backpack. In the background, another person, appearing to be male and dressed in dark clothing, sits on a bench to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor courtyard blanketed in snow during the daytime. A large, light-brown-colored building with arched windows forms the backdrop. Bare trees with snow-dusted branches are prominent, along with trimmed hedges bordering a pathway. A person wearing a brown jacket and jeans walks along the snow-covered ground. In the distance, another individual is seated on a dark park bench. The entire scene is covered in white snow, indicating winter weather.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot capturing a man in the middle ground, initially positioned slightly left of center. He walks horizontally towards the right side of the frame along a snow-covered path. To his right, further back in the middle ground bordering the background, another person sits on a bench. A large building occupies the background across the upper portion of the frame. Bare trees and hedges define the middle ground space, separating the foreground path area. Snow covers the ground in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains static and is positioned at the walking subject's level.",
