    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a cluttered kitchen countertop with various items. A black coffee maker is prominently positioned near a window, which has visible condensation and a few small bottles on the sill. In the middle of the video, a raw egg is thrown against the window, with the egg yolk and white slowly dripping down the glass. On the counter, there is a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and a loaf of bread with some slices cut off. A dark-colored bottle and a crumpled piece of foil are also present. The scene is dimly lit, with light streaming in through the window, highlighting the disarray of the kitchen items.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting with a dim atmosphere, where light filters in solely from a partially fogged and streaked window, making it difficult to determine the time of day. The scene features a cluttered countertop beneath the window, with a coffee maker, a bottle, and various kitchen items scattered across the surface, such as a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and pieces of bread. Midway through the video, a raw egg is thrown against the window, and the egg yolk slowly drips down the glass, adding to the desolate and neglected feel of the environment. The countertop is made of a smooth material, and the overall atmosphere is slightly disorganized, with a mix of textures from the different objects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a cluttered kitchen countertop, capturing all elements within the frame. The black coffee maker is centrally positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the left, while the window with condensation occupies the upper middle portion of the frame, serving as the primary light source. Small bottles rest on the window sill, located in the top right area of the frame. In the foreground, a sliced orange bell pepper lies near the center, with a plastic bag and a loaf of bread with cut slices placed to the right. A dark bottle and crumpled foil are situated towards the left side of the frame. Midway through the video, an egg is thrown against the window, with the yolk and white visibly dripping down the glass. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective at the subject's level. There are no changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame.",
