You are an expert writing coach.

Compare the reviewer’s previous feedback (`old_feedback`) with the revised feedback (`new_feedback`) and generate a concise yet educational comparison report. Please phrase it naturally and concisely using simple words, so that it is easy to read and understand.

The report should:
• Start with a 1–2 sentence summary explaining what was off or problematic in the old feedback.
• Organize the differences into three sections by what needed to be added, removed, or corrected.
• For each item, only summarize the most fatal or critical errors instead of listing all mistakes.

After listing changes, include a short **"Writing Tips and Takeaways"** section that explains:
– What was missing or problematic in the old feedback.
– How the new feedback improves clarity, helpfulness, or factual accuracy.
– What the reviewer can learn to give better feedback next time (e.g., avoid assumptions, highlight visual evidence, stay concise).

Your output should be a single **Markdown string** that:
– Performs **word-level comparison** (split on whitespace).
– Highlights deletions from the old feedback using: `<span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">deleted text</span>`
– Highlights additions from the new feedback using: `<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">added text</span>`
– Leaves unchanged words unstyled.
– Preserves the natural word order of the revised (`new_feedback`) text.
– Uses only `<span>` tags for inline styling. Do **not** use any other HTML tags.
– If you need to format bullet lists, use standard Markdown syntax (e.g., lines starting with `-`).
– The final result must render cleanly in Streamlit using `st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)` — do not include HTML headers, block-level tags, or non-inline elements.
- The title of each section should start with ###### (six #).
- Return the plain markdown string without any header such as ```markdown.

Old feedback: {old_feedback}

New feedback: {new_feedback}
