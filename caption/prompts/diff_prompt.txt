An annotator is shown a video caption and must write feedback if the caption has errors. If the caption is already correct, the feedback should be left empty. The feedback is later revised by an expert reviewer, whose version is considered ground truth.

Compare the annotator’s original feedback (`old_feedback`) with the reviewer’s revised feedback (`new_feedback`) and write a **1–2 sentence plain summary** of the most critical error in the original feedback.

Then, give a **short example (1–2 sentences)** to illustrate the mistake, using short quotes to show what the annotator missed or got wrong. Focus on clear, readable examples — especially for serious issues like left/right confusion, missing overlays, or wrongly correcting accurate text. Keep quotes short and specific (e.g., `"pan left"` vs `"pan right"`), not full sentences.

Focus only on major issues:

* If `old_feedback` is empty but `new_feedback` is not, the annotator missed important caption errors.
* If `new_feedback` is empty but `old_feedback` is not, the annotator gave feedback when the caption was already correct.
* Otherwise, check if the annotator missed or misjudged a key issue (e.g., omitted something important or tried to fix something already correct).

Ignore minor wording differences. Only highlight the **most critical failure**, if any.

Return plain text: a 1–2 sentence summary followed by a short quote-based example. No formatting.

Old feedback: {old_feedback}
New feedback: {new_feedback}
