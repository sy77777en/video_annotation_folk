You will be given a list of short error summaries generated by ChatGPT. Each summary describes the most critical mistake made by an annotator when writing feedback on a video caption. Your task is to review the list and generate a **high-level summary** of common or repeated issues.

Your output should:

* Highlight any **recurring patterns** or **systematic mistakes** (e.g., “3 cases confused ‘left’ vs ‘right’”, or “several missing feedbacks when the caption was clearly wrong”).
* Point out particularly serious or common **types of errors**, such as:
* Feedback missing entirely when caption was incorrect
* Feedback given when caption was actually perfect
* Major misunderstandings (e.g., incorrect spatial direction, missing text overlays)
* Be **concise and clear**, ideally 3–6 bullet points or short paragraphs.
* Use short quotes from the summaries where helpful (e.g., `"pan left"` vs `"pan right"`) to illustrate common mistakes.
* Do **not** copy full summaries — only aggregate insights.

Input: a list of 5–20 plain-text summaries from ChatGPT (each includes a brief explanation of the issue and a quote-based example).
Output: a plain-text high-level summary. No formatting.
