    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress standing near a refrigerator. Shortly after, a child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat enters the scene, followed by a woman in a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress. Next, a man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants appears, reaching towards the child. As the scene unfolds, the yellow door opens, revealing a girl with short dark hair in a white shirt and dark pants emerging from behind it. The sequence captures a lively interaction among the group in a domestic setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit kitchen with patterned wallpaper above white wainscoting. A prominent yellow wooden door with a black doorknob is centrally located. To the left of the door, a tall, white wooden cabinet with a silver handle is built into the wall. On the right, a cream-colored, vintage-style refrigerator stands, with a vase of blue and yellow flowers on the countertop behind it. A round wooden table is partially visible in the lower left corner of the frame. People are seen entering the kitchen through the yellow door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot with the camera at the subjects' level. Initially, a woman in a blue checkered dress is positioned in the right middle ground, standing near a cream-colored refrigerator that occupies the right foreground. A yellow door is centrally located in the background, with a white cabinet to its left in the background and a round wooden table partially visible in the bottom left foreground. A child then enters from the right foreground, moving towards the center middle ground. Following the child, a woman in a pink headscarf enters from the right foreground, also moving to the center middle ground. A man in a yellow sweater subsequently enters from the right foreground, positioning himself in the center middle ground behind the woman in the headscarf and reaching towards the child. Finally, the yellow door in the center background opens, and a girl emerges from the background, stepping into the middle ground near the doorway, joining the group now congregated in the central area of the kitchen.",
