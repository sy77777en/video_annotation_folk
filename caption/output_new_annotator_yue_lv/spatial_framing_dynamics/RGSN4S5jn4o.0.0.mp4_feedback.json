    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, where a black and white checkerboard crosswalk occupies the foreground and center. A man in a light green shirt walks from the right foreground towards the left foreground across this crosswalk. In the middle ground, to the right, a cyclist and a yellow taxi move towards the camera. On the left middle ground, another man in a yellow-green jacket walks near a flower stand, with buildings in the background. As the crosswalk pattern changes to white abstract lines, a white animated paint bucket icon briefly appears on it. The camera then pans left, transitioning to a full shot, as a woman with pink hair enters from the right middle ground, walking towards the center foreground across the abstract crosswalk. An older Asian man follows her from the right middle ground, and the man in the yellow-green jacket is also visible further to the right in the middle ground, all moving towards the center foreground. A \"Brushes\" UI element appears superimposed in the top right. The woman in the center foreground then transforms into an animated character, followed by the man in the yellow-green jacket who also animates as he moves towards the center foreground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a street crosswalk that dynamically changes its appearance, starting as a black and white checkerboard pattern and then shifting to a complex white abstract line art design on a dark gray background. A Black man with short dark hair, wearing a light green long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, tan shoes, and a black backpack, walks from right to left across this transforming crosswalk. Not far from him, a man wearing a black hoodie and gray pants rides a bicycle, and a yellow taxi cab moves in the same direction, approaching the camera. On the left sidewalk, near a vibrant flower stand, a man wearing a yellow-green jacket and a light-colored beanie walks by; other individuals, including one in a pink top, are also near the flowers. Subsequently, a woman with short, bright pink hair, dressed in a green jacket, a light green top, yellow pants, and black shoes, and holding a small, fluffy pink creature, walks across the abstract-patterned crosswalk. As she crosses the street, the camera pans left and finally faces her, at which point she transforms from a real person into an animated character, though her clothing colors remain unchanged. Behind her is an older Asian man with graying hair, wearing a dark suit and a light-colored shirt, crossing the street with her. At this point, further to the right in the frame is the man wearing a yellow-green jacket and a light-colored beanie, also crossing the street in the same direction. Later, he too is animated from foot to head into a cartoon character. Throughout the video, white animated icons, such as a cartoon-style paint bucket, and a user interface element labeled \"Brushes\" with brush stroke examples, are superimposed on the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, navigates a city street during the day. The scene features multi-story buildings, some with brick and others with modern facades, including one with a prominent green plant wall. The crosswalk initially displays a black and white checkerboard pattern, which then transitions to a dark surface covered in intricate white abstract line art. On the concrete sidewalk, pedestrians walk past a red post box and a vibrant flower stand. A yellow taxi and a cyclist are visible on the asphalt road. Overlays appear throughout: initially, white outline icons of a paint bucket are briefly visible on the crosswalk when the crosswalk transitions to a dark surface covered in abstract line art. Later, an animated character with pink hair and a green outfit is superimposed over a real person, and a \"Brushes\" menu displaying three brush stroke options appears in the top right corner of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
