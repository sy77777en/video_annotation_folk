    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a street crosswalk that dynamically changes its appearance, starting as a black and white checkerboard pattern and then shifting to a complex white abstract line art design on a dark gray background. A Black man with short dark hair, wearing a light green long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, tan shoes, and a black backpack, walks from right to left across this transforming crosswalk. Not far from him, a man wearing a black hoodie and gray pants rides a bicycle, and a yellow taxi cab moves in the same direction, approaching the camera. On the left sidewalk, near a vibrant flower stand, a man wearing a yellow-green jacket and a light-colored beanie walks by; other individuals, including one in a pink top, are also near the flowers. Subsequently, a woman with short, bright pink hair, dressed in a green jacket, a light green top, yellow pants, and black shoes, and holding a small, fluffy pink creature, walks across the abstract-patterned crosswalk. As she crosses the street, the camera pans left and finally faces her, at which point she transforms from a real person into an animated character, though her clothing colors remain unchanged. Behind her is an older Asian man with graying hair, wearing a dark suit and a light-colored shirt, crossing the street with her. At this point, further to the right in the frame is the man wearing a yellow-green jacket and a light-colored beanie, also crossing the street in the same direction. Later, he too is animated from foot to head into a cartoon character. Throughout the video, white animated icons, such as a cartoon-style paint bucket, and a user interface element labeled \"Brushes\" with brush stroke examples, are superimposed on the scene.**",
    "pre_caption": "A Black man walks from right to left across a crosswalk as its pattern changes from a checkerboard to abstract white lines. Simultaneously, a cyclist and a yellow taxi cab move from right to left in the background. On the left sidewalk, a man in a yellow-green jacket walks leftward. Later, a woman with pink hair and an older Asian man walk together from right to left across the abstract-patterned crosswalk. The man in the yellow-green jacket also crosses the street from right to left, to their right. As the camera pans left following the woman, she transforms into an animated character while walking. Subsequently, the man in the yellow-green jacket also animates into a cartoon character from his feet upwards as he walks. Throughout the sequence, white animated icons and a \"Brushes\" user interface element are overlaid on the scene.",
