    "pre_caption_prompt": "Given the following camera motion description:\n\"The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, capturing a street view. It then pans left to make a turn before continuing its unsteady forward motion to cross the street.\"\nImagine a plausible video scene that aligns with this motion. Describe how both the subjects and the camera move throughout the video, starting from the first frame. Write a single, concise, and fluent paragraph that seamlessly integrates the camera behavior into the overall scene description. The caption should focus on what is visible in the video \u2014 actions, motion, and interactions \u2014 and use natural language without explicitly labeling the camera movement (e.g., avoid phrases like \u201cthe camera pans\u201d or \u201cwe see\u201d). Instead, let the camera motion be implicitly felt through how the scene unfolds.",
    "pre_caption": "An unsteady forward momentum carries the view along a city street, focusing on a man in a light green shirt as he steps onto a bold checkerboard crosswalk. With his passage, the crosswalk's surface magically transforms into a canvas of intricate white line art. The gaze then sweeps leftward, briefly encompassing a sidewalk flower stall and its patrons, before settling on a woman in vibrant yellow attire who begins to walk. The perspective resumes its shaky advance, accompanying her as she starts her journey across the newly art-covered street.",
