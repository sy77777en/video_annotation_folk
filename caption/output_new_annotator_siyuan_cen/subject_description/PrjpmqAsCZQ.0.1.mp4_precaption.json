    "pre_caption_prompt": "As a professional captioner and cinematographer, describe how the subjects move throughout the video, beginning from the first frame. Write a single, concise, and fluent paragraph that emphasizes subject motion, visual detail, and natural progression over time. Your description should be visually grounded and coherent, as if narrating exactly what a viewer would observe. Do not mention the camera, editing techniques, or visual effects.",
    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit, green-hued room, a person stands in front of a glowing computer screen, initially facing it and making subtle hand movements. They then turn slightly, bringing a hand to their mouth before gesturing outwards with their right hand. The individual then raises their right index finger, pointing upwards, before bringing the same finger to the side of their head. Throughout these movements, they are wearing a light-colored jacket over a darker shirt, and what appears to be a patterned bandana or head covering. Studio monitors are visible on either side of the computer, and a microphone stand is to the right.",
