    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a snow-covered path in the center foreground, leading into the middle ground. A large snowbank occupies the right middle ground, while a building with a snow-covered roof is partially visible in the left middle ground. A forest lines the background under a cloudy sky at the top of the frame. The camera then tilts downwards, transitioning to a first-person perspective from a sled. In this view, the operator's hands gripping a steering wheel are centered in the foreground, with their legs visible in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. The front of the sled occupies the lower center foreground. The snowy path extends forward from the bottom center into the middle ground, with the snowbank still visible on the right middle ground and the forest in the background. The camera maintains a low position, simulating the viewpoint of the person on the sled.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a first-person perspective, initially showing a snow-covered background before tilting downward to reveal the person sitting on a snow sled, who is also the videographer. The person is seated, facing the snow-covered trail, with his hands, covered by a black jacket, gripping the black steering wheel of the sled. His legs, clad in grey pants, are visible on either side. The sled features skis and some blue markings. The trail displays tracks left in the snow, with a large snowbank to the right and a building with a snow-covered roof partially visible on the left. In the distance, a forest of evergreen trees stands under a cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set on a snow-covered slope. The scene unfolds on a steep, snow-laden path flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a serene winter landscape. The ground is blanketed in thick, white snow, with visible tracks suggesting recent movement. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light, indicating that the scene takes place during the day. In the foreground, a hand grips the steering wheel of a sled or similar vehicle, indicating motion down the snowy slope. The scene conveys a sense of movement through this wintry setting, with the path curving gently ahead and snowbanks lining the sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
