    "pre_caption": "This medium shot captures five figures in white jumpsuits within a white, minimalist environment. A figure stands in the left foreground, holding a small object near a white geometric structure located in the center middle ground; this structure also contains a black monitor. A second figure, wearing a top hat, is positioned in the center middle ground, leaning forward towards the left. Directly behind the figure in the top hat, a third figure stands in the center middle ground. A fourth figure occupies the right middle ground, facing towards the center. Partially visible in the far right background is a fifth figure. The camera maintains a fixed position at the subjects' level, providing a stable view of the spatial arrangement without any changes in framing or position during the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows five figures dressed in identical white jumpsuits with orange piping along the seams. Their heads and faces are covered by white hoods. One figure, positioned centrally and leaning forward, wears a maroon top hat. To the left, another figure stands and holds a small object, possibly a figurine, on the desk in front of a display screen. Behind the figure in the top hat stands a third figure. To the right, a fourth figure, wearing white goggles pushed up onto his hood, faces the group. A fifth figure, partially visible behind the fourth figure on the right, appears disengaged. The individuals on the far left and far right are looking to the right, while the three people in the middle are focused on the small object on the desk, directing their gaze toward the person on the far left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a minimalist environment characterized by plain white walls and a white geometric structure resembling steps. A black rectangular monitor is visible within this structure. The video is shot from an objective and neutral point of view. Four characters dressed in white jumpsuits with orange trim are grouped around the monitor. Starting from the left, three of these characters are standing together, observing the monitor, while the person on the far right, distinguished by a red top hat, is not interacting with the others.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
