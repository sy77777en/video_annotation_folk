    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress, positioned near a refrigerator. She appears to be interacting with a child in a colorful outfit and red hat, who is facing her. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is also present, reaching towards the child. Next to him, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress stands close by. In the background, another person with short hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is visible near a door. The scene suggests a lively interaction among the group, with everyone appearing to be in a hurry, as if they are trying to accomplish something quickly or get somewhere in a domestic setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting with a vintage aesthetic, characterized by a yellow door and patterned wallpaper. The room features a large, cream-colored refrigerator with a rounded design, typical of mid-20th-century appliances. A wooden dining table is partially visible, accompanied by chairs that suggest a cozy, domestic environment. The lighting indicates daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. Several individuals are interacting in a busy and hurried manner, possibly due to a speed-up video effect, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment. The overall atmosphere is warm and nostalgic, enhanced by the retro color palette and furnishings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of several subjects in a domestic kitchen setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, near a cream-colored refrigerator. She interacts with a child in a colorful outfit and red hat, who is in the middle ground slightly to the left. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants enters from the left, moving towards the child. He is initially on the left side of the frame but moves closer to the center. A woman with a pink headscarf and light-colored dress stands beside the man, also in the foreground. In the background, another person with short hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is near a yellow door, positioned towards the back left of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, capturing their interactions without significant changes in shot size or position. The wooden dining table is partially visible in the bottom left corner, indicating the foreground. The overall spatial arrangement emphasizes the group's activity in the kitchen, with the subjects primarily occupying the foreground and middle ground while the background remains relatively static.",
