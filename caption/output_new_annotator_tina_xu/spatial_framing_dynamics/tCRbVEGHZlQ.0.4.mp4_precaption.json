    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a humanoid stick figure, presented as a solid black silhouette with a round head, stick-like limbs, and blocky feet, devoid of any discernible clothing or facial features. In the second half of the video, an open brown briefcase with a red interior lining and white papers inside becomes visible as the stick figure walks toward it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character depicts a minimalist outdoor setting against a plain white background. A thin black horizontal line represents the ground, below which sparse, small green tufts of grass are visible. A black silhouette figure walks from left to right along the ground line. Midway through the video, an open, brown, rectangular briefcase containing white paper becomes visible and is placed on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a full shot. Initially, a black silhouette stick figure stands in the center of the frame, positioned on a black horizontal line representing the ground at the bottom edge. Small green grass tufts are scattered below this line in the foreground. The stick figure then walks from the center towards the right side of the frame, remaining on the ground line in the middle ground. As the figure moves right, an open brown briefcase appears on the ground line in the bottom right quadrant, also in the middle ground. The camera maintains a stationary, side-view perspective, positioned level with the figure against a white background.",
