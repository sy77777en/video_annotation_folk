    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the man, capturing him from the waist up as he stands in the center of the frame. He is positioned in the foreground, with electronic equipment like speakers and a monitor in the background, slightly out of focus. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more closely on his upper body and face. Throughout the sequence, the man moves from facing sideways to turning towards the camera, eventually facing forward. His gestures, such as raising his hand near his head, are clearly visible in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The background elements stay static, reinforcing the focus on the man's actions and expressions. The camera shakes slightly, contributing to the dynamic feel of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and light skin tone. He is wearing a dark bandana, a light-colored jacket, and a dark shirt with a visible graphic design. In one part of the video, he is standing and facing sideways, while in another, he is facing forward and gesturing with his hand near his head. The setting appears to be dimly lit, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or low-light conditions. He is singing along to the song's lyrics, with his body movements synchronized to the song's rhythm, and he is the central focus throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a dimly lit room, with a green night vision effect that casts an eerie glow over the scene. The setting includes electronic equipment, such as speakers and a monitor, suggesting a studio or control room environment. The walls are dark, and the equipment is arranged on shelves or tables. The atmosphere is dynamic, with the main character actively moving, singing and smoking along to a hip-hop song. There are noticeable camera shakes, adding to the energetic feel of the scene. The overall color scheme is monochromatic due to the night vision, with shades of green dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Also add that the man is smoking when he raises his hand near his hand. Lastly remove the background elements stay static as it doesn't make sense. The camera is constantly slightly shaking and varies in dutch angle due to that it might be a handheld camera. This contributes to the dynamic feeling of the scene in which the man is moving according to the song rhythm throughout the video. ",
