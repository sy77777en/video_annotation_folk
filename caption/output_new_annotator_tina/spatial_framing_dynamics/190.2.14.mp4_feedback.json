    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of two individuals, capturing them from the chest up. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the man is on the right. Both are in the foreground, with the background consisting of dimly lit foliage and shadows, indicating a nighttime setting. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence. Initially, the woman looks slightly upward, and the man looks toward her. As the frames progress, the woman turns her head to face the man directly, maintaining eye contact. The man continues to look at the woman, occasionally shifting his gaze slightly. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera position; the framing consistently focuses on the upper bodies and faces of the two individuals, emphasizing their interaction against the dark, natural backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman and a man sitting close together on a moving vehicle. The woman has short, dark curly hair and is wearing a dark jacket with a colorful patterned scarf around her neck. Her expression is neutral, and she is looking slightly upward. The man has short, curly dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He is looking at the woman with a neutral expression. Both subjects are positioned in a way that suggests they are engaged in a conversation. The lighting is dim, indicating a nighttime setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor nighttime setting, likely in a residential area. The scene is dimly lit, with shadows cast by nearby trees, suggesting a quiet, possibly suburban environment. The darkness is punctuated by subtle lighting that highlights the subjects' faces, creating a contrast with the surrounding obscurity. The subjects are positioned close together, with foliage in the background, indicating a natural setting. The overall atmosphere is calm, with gentle movement of tree branches swaying in the breeze, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The lighting and composition focus on the interaction between the subjects, framed by the night and the natural elements around them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
