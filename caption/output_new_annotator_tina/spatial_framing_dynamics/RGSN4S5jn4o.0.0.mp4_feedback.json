    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot capturing the entire street scene, including the crosswalk, buildings, and moving subjects. Initially, a man in a turquoise jacket and jeans is positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the right, walking across the checkered crosswalk. As he moves from the right towards the left, the camera follows him, transitioning to a full shot. The woman with pink hair, initially in the background on the left, gradually moves into the foreground, becoming more central as she walks alongside the man. She is depicted in a transition to an animated style. Another animated figure, wearing a pink jacket and blue pants, appears further back in the middle ground, also moving towards the center. The yellow car remains in the background on the right side of the frame throughout. The bicycle with a basket of flowers is stationary on the left side of the frame, near the sidewalk. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects, keeping all figures within the frame as they move. The digital interface on the right side of the screen remains static, overlaying the scene without affecting the spatial dynamics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a city street scene with a mix of real and animated subjects. A man with dark skin tone, wearing a turquoise jacket and jeans, is walking across the crosswalk. Nearby, a woman with pink hair, depicted in a transition to animated style, wears a green jacket and yellow pants and holds a small dog. Another animated figure, a person with a pink jacket and blue pants, appears to be walking. In the background, a yellow car is visible on the street, and a bicycle with a basket of flowers is parked on the sidewalk. The scene blends real and animated elements, creating a unique visual contrast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set in an urban outdoor environment. The scene unfolds on a city street lined with modern buildings featuring large windows and varied facades. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, indicated by the clear, bright lighting. A notable visual element is a checkered crosswalk, adding a distinct pattern to the street. A yellow taxi is visible, suggesting a bustling city atmosphere. The street is bordered by sidewalks with planters and a variety of flowers, adding color and life to the scene. Overlay elements include animated characters and a digital interface on the right side, displaying options like \"Brushes\" and various icons, indicating an augmented reality or digital art theme. These overlays are not part of the physical environment but enhance the visual experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

During this movement, a woman with pink hair, initially in the background on the left, gradually moves into the foreground. The yellow taxi didn't stay in the background throughout the entire video, only stayed at the right background for the first half of the video before getting out of the frame due to camera movements. The bicyle is not stationary on the left side of the frame but instead starts off being at the very left boarder of the frame before transitioning to being more central background along with the camera movements. The camera also didn't maintain at a level height relative to the subjects. it begins with being a rather slightly high-lvel angle looking downward at the crosswalk before transitioning to an eye level angle toward the second half of the video. Lastly, the digital interface didn't remain static but appeared on the top right side of the screen when the animations begin and slightly expanded throughtout. ",
