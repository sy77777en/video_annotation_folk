    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide view of a snow-covered path flanked by tall evergreen trees on both sides, forming the background. The path occupies the center of the frame, extending into the distance. Snowbanks line the edges of the path, positioned in the middle ground on either side. The sky, overcast and gray, forms the top part of the frame. As the camera tilts downward, the focus shifts to the foreground, revealing a person's hand gripping a black circular steering mechanism. This hand is located in the bottom left of the frame, while the metallic frame of the sled, with a visible logo, is seen in the bottom right. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout, capturing the transition from the expansive snowy landscape to the close-up of the sled's controls. The tracks on the snow indicate the sled's movement along the path. The spatial dynamics shift from a broad view of the environment to a detailed focus on the operator's interaction with the sled.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot from a first-person perspective, showcases a snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees lining the sides of a snow-covered path. As the camera tilts down, parts of the person's body become visible, revealing them operating a sled or similar vehicle. The person is wearing a dark jacket, and their hand is visible on the black circular steering mechanism. The sled has a metallic frame with a visible logo or emblem. The path shows tracks from previous movement, indicating the sled's direction, conveying a sense of winter activity in a forested area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set in a snowy outdoor environment. The scene unfolds on a snow-covered road flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a serene winter landscape. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the area. Snowbanks line the road, adding to the wintry atmosphere. The road shows tracks, indicating recent movement. At a pivotal moment, the camera tilts downward to reveal the foreground, where a hand grips the steering wheel of a sled or similar vehicle, suggesting motion along the snowy path. The overall setting is calm and expansive, with the natural beauty of the snow and trees dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
