    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes running down the sides. Each person wears a white hood that covers their head, leaving no visible facial features. One individual stands out by wearing a tall, red top hat. They are all gathered closely around a small, black rectangular screen mounted on a white structure. However, their attention is directed towards a human-like figure being held by the person on the left, with some leaning in and others standing upright, suggesting a focused and engaged interaction with the figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen embedded in the wall. One person wears a distinctive red top hat, adding a splash of color to the scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, intently observing the screen. The lighting is bright and even, emphasizing the simplicity and uniformity of the setting. The overall atmosphere is clinical and focused, with the white and orange attire contrasting against the neutral background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of five individuals in white outfits with orange stripes, gathered around a central white structure with a black screen. The shot captures the subjects from the waist up, allowing a clear view of their upper bodies and interactions. The person wearing the red top hat is positioned slightly to the left of the center in the 2D frame and occupies the foreground in the 3D space. This individual leans forward toward the screen. To the left, another person holds a human-like figure, drawing the attention of the group. This person is also in the foreground, slightly to the left in the 2D frame. The remaining three individuals stand to the right, with two leaning in closer to the screen and one standing more upright. These three are positioned in the middle ground in the 3D space and span from the center-right to the far right in the 2D frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence. The background consists of plain white walls, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on the subjects.",
