    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a white outfit, standing with their back to the camera, facing a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The person appears to be wearing a form-fitting suit with a high collar and has a hood or helmet covering their head. In front of them, the screen displays a close-up of a woman's face. The woman has short, dark hair and is wearing white goggles on her head. Her expression is serious, and she is looking directly ahead, slightly looking down at the small figure. The contrast between the small figure of the person and the large, detailed face on the screen creates a striking visual composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a large screen displaying a close-up of a person's face. The person on the screen wears white goggles and a white outfit with red stripes. In front of the screen, a figure dressed in a similar white suit stands, facing the screen. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the interaction between the figure and the screen. The lighting is even, highlighting the contrast between the large face on the screen and the smaller figure in the foreground. The scene is devoid of additional props or decorations, emphasizing the stark, focused atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a person dressed in white standing with their back to the camera in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman\u2019s face.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a wide shot featuring a person in a white outfit standing with their back to the camera, positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. This individual occupies the lower portion of the frame, while a large screen dominates the upper part, displaying a close-up of a woman's face. The woman's face is centered on the screen, which is in the background, creating a strong contrast between the small figure in the foreground and the large image behind. The person in the white outfit remains stationary throughout the sequence, maintaining their position in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing both the figure and the screen in a single, stable shot. There are no changes in shot size or spatial position during the video. The overall composition emphasizes the interaction between the figure and the screen, with the subject remaining in the foreground and the screen consistently in the background.",
