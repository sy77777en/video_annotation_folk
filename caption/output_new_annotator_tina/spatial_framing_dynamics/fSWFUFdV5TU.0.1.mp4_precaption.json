    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a cluttered kitchen countertop with various items. A black coffee maker is prominently positioned near a window, which has a few small bottles on the sill. The countertop is scattered with a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and some bread pieces. There is also a dark-colored bottle and a crumpled piece of foil. Midway through the video, an egg is thrown and smashed against the window from the outside. The lighting is dim, with natural light filtering through the window, casting shadows and highlighting the disarray of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting during the daytime, characterized by a cluttered countertop beneath a window. The scene includes a black coffee maker, a metal basket, and various kitchen items scattered across the surface, such as a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and pieces of bread. The window, partially fogged, allows diffused light to illuminate the area, casting soft lighting. Several small bottles are lined up on the windowsill, adding to the disarray. The overall atmosphere is one of casual disorganization, with natural light highlighting the textures and materials of the objects present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a cluttered kitchen countertop, capturing the entire scene without focusing on specific subjects. The black coffee maker is centrally located in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the left of the frame. To its right, a metal basket sits closer to the center. Various items, including a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and bread pieces, are scattered across the countertop in the foreground, occupying the lower part of the frame. A dark-colored bottle and crumpled foil are also visible in the foreground, towards the left side. The window, situated in the background, spans the upper portion of the frame, with small bottles placed on the sill near the center-right. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective at the subject's level. Midway through the video, an egg is thrown from outside and smashes against the window, creating a dynamic change in the background while the rest of the scene remains static. The lighting is dim, with natural light filtering through the window, illuminating the scene from above.",
