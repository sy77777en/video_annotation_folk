Provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.

First, specify the **shot size** based on how much of the subject is visible. For example, *a close-up shot of a human face*, *a medium shot of a man’s lower body*, or *a wide shot of a man standing near the ocean*. If the shot size does not follow a typical framing pattern or changes erratically, describe the overall framing instead, such as *"The camera tracks a skateboarder in an unsteady manner, mostly capturing the skateboarder’s lower body."*  

Next, describe the **subject’s position in the scene**. Indicate their approximate location within the frame, such as *"The person is in the bottom-left corner of the frame"* or *"The person is on the right of the frame."* Describe their depth in the scene relative to the **foreground, midground, or background**, such as *"In the foreground, a person is sitting in front of a computer."* Additionally, specify their physical placement within the environment, such as *"The woman in the midground stands near a window, looking outside."*  

Finally, describe the **subject’s height relative to the camera**, if relevant. Indicate whether they are framed at eye level, above, or below the camera’s perspective, such as *"The man is framed at eye level."* or *"A low-angle shot captures the person from below."*
