Please avoid using phrases like "the first frame" or "the last frame" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as "the video." Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.
