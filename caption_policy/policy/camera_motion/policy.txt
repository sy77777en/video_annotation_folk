Provide a concise yet fluid description of the camera movement based on the given details, ensuring clarity and readability. Use active voice and vivid phrasing (e.g., 'the camera arcs around the subject') while naturally integrating translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, and complexity into a cohesive sentence. Avoid robotic lists by weaving details into a smooth narrative (e.g., 'A slow-motion scene filmed at eye level follows the subject as the camera trucks left...'). If the camera is static, specify whether it remains fixed or vibrates. If in motion, describe its type, direction, and speed using precise terms such as tracking, arcing, dollying, trucking, panning, tilting, pedestaling, or rolling, maintaining a natural chronological flow. If movement is fragmented or erratic, summarize succinctly rather than detailing every minor shift. Use the provided human-labeled ground truth directly, making only necessary corrections for typos or grammar without unnecessary paraphrasing.

General Policy: If the camera is static, state that it is fixed, with or without vibration. If it moves, describe the type of movement, direction, and speed, specifying movements such as tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis). Distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in temporal order (e.g., “The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”). If motion appears fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small movement (e.g., “The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”).
