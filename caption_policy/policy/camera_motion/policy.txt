Provide a concise yet informative description of the camera movements in the video based on the details we provide, covering translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, and complexity. Return only the description without paraphrasing or altering content unless correcting clear typos or grammar errors.

General Policy: If the camera is static, state that it is fixed, with or without vibration. If it moves, describe the type of movement, direction, and speed, specifying movements such as tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis). Distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in temporal order (e.g., “The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”). If motion appears fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small movement (e.g., “The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”).
